- I'm writing this for the first time, and I really with I would have started documenting things in this way so that I could establish a deeper reflection with this whole process of the open source factory.
- I was trying to implement the functionality inside the sadhana for moving from the element with index X to the X-1 and X+1 by clicking on a button and it is hard if there is not a direct reference of this index in the slug that determines which is the thing that is being displayed, and how many of them are in the whole thing. Each individual sadhana element should have a reference to all of them.
