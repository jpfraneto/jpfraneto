This is the home for my creations.

I'm a full stack web developer whose mission is to learn how to build systems, to bring the ideas that I have into a reality.

One of the key components of what I build is an understanding that design is very important, both in the code and in the way the project is presented to the end user. If it is not appealing, no one will use it. If it doesn't work properly, it will be hard to maintain. I open source most of my projects, so it is very important for me to have in mind that more people (and myself!) will come later to check out the code.

The projects that I have built are:

Human-Music 21tv Drip-Work

The list will keep growing.
