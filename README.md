This is the home for my software craftmanship.

I see building software as an art, and I try my best to become the best developer that I can. This means envisioning over and over which is the functionality that the products I build will have, and how will they impact the life of the users. 

Software gave me the freedom to transform my ideas into a reality, and the pace on which that happens now is incredibly fast.

One of the key components of what I build is an understanding that design is very important, both in the code and in the way the project is presented to the end user. If it is not appealing, no one will use it. I'm not good at design (yet), but I'm trying my best to learn. 

If the product doesn't work properly, it will be hard to maintain. I open source most of my projects, so it is very important for me to have in mind that more people (and myself!) will come later to check out the code.

Most of the apps that I have built are not running right now, but I'm putting all of my energy to build Anky.

You can see how passionate i am for building this thing in this video: https://x.com/kithkui/status/1681375014170263570. lol.

I will keep evolving, and learning how to become more present as I practice my craft.
