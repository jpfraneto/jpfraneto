This is my home in the internet.

- Section on which people can write about their relationship with me.
- Footer bar with a cool thing to say.

- Images that have been important for me.
- Thoughts and quotes that have been important.
- Explain why I took the decisions that I took as I was creating the site.

ME:

- I have put a lot of effort to understand technological systems and how they are built so that I can design and create them with an organic, resilient way in mind. That's why human music is an eternal cycle, because there doesn't need to be anything else than what it is for it to work.
