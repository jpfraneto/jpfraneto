add a mentors page in each of my realms:

Woodworking: Nelson Vyhmeister
Stoneworking: Ivan Nove Starine

What do I want to bring into the world?

- Shining a light for people that I care about.

Add cuarentena page on which I share the work I do (circles as the ones in holamila, with half of it contained by the programming part and the other half the yoga). That is how I educate myself.
