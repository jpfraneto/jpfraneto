Much better day today. Things in the house are much better, and today I wrote an important letter to my partner sharing with her how tough I am even with myself pretending to be something different from what I am now. I feel that I'm in the verge of understanding how to look to myself and see who I am really, and with that comes a lot of peace.

The peace that I need to build this project, this website, my window to the world. This will be a place where I write a lot, and it will be important to have the capacity to display what I have written in a way that makes sense to the reader.

That is why I'm implementing markdown, so that I can get good at writing with it, and I'm going to iterate over the design of the page so that I can display every piece of content in a way that feels good to who is reading. That is the most important part. Make it easy to acccess what has been written, since I write in a good way. I need to do it more consistently! But today was a great session, and things are beginning to get cleared in my mind.
