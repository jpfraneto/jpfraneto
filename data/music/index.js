        Sorry about the shitty styling of this place. I know it doesn't follow
        the structure of the whole site, and the design of it, but fuck that. I
        need to tell you something. I'm right now in the middle of a storm, in
        my house, enoying an incredible piece of music that the musicians of Ill
        Considered created. I want to share with you the music that I like, and
        for that I think the best way is that you visit [Human
        Music](https://www.human-music.com) for the music from youtube. Visit my
        profile in soundcloud[](https://www.soundcloud.com/users/jpfraneto).
        Lastly, I listen to music in spotify, and [here]() is my profile also.//

export default Music;
