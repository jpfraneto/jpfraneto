This is the creative project that I have done that makes me feel more proud. I spent a very long time deciding how to hang those 5 hexagons together so that they could form something that had meaning, that looked good. In the workshop I played and played with them hanging from the ceiling, until when I was eventually able to realize that the answer was to be simple. So I just made each hexagon hang from the previous one, and the end result is amazing. This lamp is in the living room of our house, and laying in the floor to stare to the ceiling is an experience that always fills me with joy.

There is an aspect of its depth that makes me feel alive. That makes me wonder. And the light that comes from it is dim, it is perfect for being in the living room listening to music, enjoying the ease of the darkness, but with a little bit of light.
