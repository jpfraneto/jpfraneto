This is a mirror that I created, and eventually it will be part of a proyect that I will create called 'Stare at your own eyes'. There is something fundamentally challenging in spending a long time staring at the darkness of your own pupils, and for me mirrors are for that. They are for understanding who I am, and I want to create this project to bring that consciousness into people. We spend a lot of time ~watching~ judging our bodies in them. What if we spent that time enjoying the look of our eyes?
