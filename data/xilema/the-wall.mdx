This is the wall of the living room of our house, and it was created with very old pieces of wood from a tree called Alerce. This pieces of wood were the fence of the house of my grandparents, so there is a lot of history in there. I cut them all with the angle based on the golden ratio, 137,5ยบ. I did not know what I was doing until it was ready, and now it looks very nice. It is an important touch of the house.
