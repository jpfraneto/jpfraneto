This is a friend that is waiting in the darkness. He is a little bit shy, because there has been a misconception within who has had contact with him that he is dangerous. But he is not dangerous. He just looks ugly. And people judge him and think that he is mean, without ever finding the space for him to show who he really is. How would life look like if we all were able to stop judging from the appearances of who/what we interact with? What do we lose because of not opening ourselves to the unknown?
