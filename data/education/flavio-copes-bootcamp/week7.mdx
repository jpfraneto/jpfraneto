It is important to be familiar with the codes that the API should return so that it makes sense for it being part of the system. Here are the status codes:

- `200 OK`: this is the standard response for successful HTTP requests.
- `201 Created`: Typically a response to a POST request. The request has been completed, and a new resource has been created.
- `400 Bad Request` Due to a request error that was generated on the client, the server cannot process the request. Errors can include a malformed request, size too large to be handled, or others
- `401 Unauthorized` Sent when authentication is required and the client is not authorized
- `403 Forbidden` The resource is not available for various reasons. If the reason is authentication, prefer the 401 Unauthorized status code.
- `404 Not Found` The requested resource could not be found.
- `405 Method Not Allowed` The resource is not available through that HTTP method, but might be with another.
- `500 Internal Server Error` A generic server error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.

Process for building an API:

- Getting to know about the project and which are the interfaces that are going to interact with the API.
- Understanding the requirements. 
- There are multiple design decisions that I have to have in mind as the creator of the API. 

To setup a prisma DB in the project:

```js
npm install -D prisma
npx prisma init
```

Then I create a railway db and connect it to the prisma schema by adding it to the .env file. Then I set up the models for the data, having in mind that a ? makes the column optional. To sync the database with the schema I run the following command:

```js
npx prisma migrate dev
```

To enable absolute imports, create a jsconfig.json file in the root and add this code:

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```
