## Forms

This week is all about creating and managing forms. In react, every value entered in a form is associated with a state variable defined with useState. When sending the data to the server, this state variable is used.

## Authentication and sessions

I did not really get too much out of this week. It was a very shallow description of the topics, using examples where the schemas are very underexplained.
