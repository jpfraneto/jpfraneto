## introduction

- Design has rules and techniques and guidelines that you just need to learn how to follow them.
- Design is a mental skill. It is related to the way on which you look to things.
- Build something that people will pay good money for.

## layout is king

- It all starts with alignment and grid.
- We avoid chaos and seek order.
- If we take every chance to align items we bring ourselves into a more aestetically organic project.
- Six ways of aligning:
  - Left
  - Center
  - Right
  - Top
  - Center
  - Bottom
- The grid: Way of organizing stuff in a page to put them into a recognizable structure.
- Design really likes a grid that is divided in equal sizes.
- Reuse the same values as much as possible (gaps between elements brings balanced layout)
- When something looks predictable and familiar (because of the underlying grid) then the audience and the viewer will trust the website more.
- Engrain the great design habit inside me.
- If we are breaking a design rule, we have to do it with an intention.

PRACTICE:

- In figma, each frame has its own grid.
- The most widely used layout in web design is 12 columns grid. It divides very well.
- Gutter: Space between columns.
- Make sure to add a little margin on boths sides so that the columns are not till the edges.

- Visual Hierarchy: What are the elements that demand attention?
- We cannot focus on one thing at a time.
- The hierarchy in design begins with the focal point.
- When we see good design a lot of times it is the visual hierarchy that contributes to its beauty.
- What is the primary message?
- What are the goals of the website? How can I achieve those goals?
- A hero section of almost every website has to answer three questions for the user:
  - What is this website about?
  - What am I going to get out of this website?
  - How do I get it?
- Different levels of visual importance between elements in the page.
- Beware of optical illusions. Most of the time trust our eyes. Compensate the optical illusion. It is more important than the pixel sizes.
- One common mistake is to space things evenly in the page. All beginners have a fear of empty space.
- Proximity: Things that are related should be close together, and things that are not related should be farther apart.

## how to use typography beautifully

- How to combinate fonts, their size, weight, etc.
- The typeface is the 'family', the font is which individual component of that family I use.
- Typeface comes with a personality. The classifications of the typeface speak about this (categories):
  - Serif / Sans Serif. The serif are the tail on the letters.
- Most typefaces have been designed with a specific intention.
- Letter spacing is an attribute of the font that can be tweaked.
- Line height.
- Font weight.
- Achieve visual hierarchy between elements.
- The letters have gravitational pool and heavier objects pull each other together.
- Thin weights for paragraph text can make it hard to read.
- Use maximum two fonts for each project, make sure they look different. Desciphering too many font styles is overwhelming. If they are very similar it is boring and it doesn't make an impact.
