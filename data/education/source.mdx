title: Week 2 - Flavio Copes Bootcamp
university: Flavio Copes
---

This week is all about using astro and tailwind to create fast and static websites. This is perfect for what I need in my next project, which is the consumation of my experience of learning Kundalini Yoga for being a teacher of that technology. The project is all about creating a journey for a group of people that don't have access to this technology yet, and what came to my mind instantly as I was thinking what to do it about was:

####Being a father!

Yes. I became a father 6 months ago, and it has been a fucking hard journey. I would have loved to be part of a community of men with which I could have travelled this path together, so that we could understand each other, and through that become a better participants of our families. No one told me how to do this, but if I had had the opportunity of sharing my experience with other people that were in the same place it would have been easier (and it would still be). That's why with this project I'm looking to find some resolution into my own path, and healing. I think that mixing it with the opportunity that this bootcamp is giving me for learning new technologies in the way that it is doing it, is perfect. Let's do it.

First, I'll have to create a new project with [astro](https://astro.build/).

I go to my directory and run the following commands: 

`mkdir kundalini-parenting
 cd kundalini-parenting
 npm init astro `

 In the prompts, I choose the starter option with react, and then run the following commands: 

 `npm install
  git init && git add -A && git commit -m 'Initial commit'
  npm run dev`

  to see that everything is up and running.

  It is working, and then I run this command:

  `npm install -D tailwindcss`

  to install tailwind in the developer dependencies.
