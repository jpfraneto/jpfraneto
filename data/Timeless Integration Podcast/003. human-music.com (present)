I tried to share what was happening in youtube, through a video that I could share live. For people to see, to realize how amazing it is to be in this body. How do you feel in your own body? I wonder... I wonder how it feels to enhabit the body of a human being. How interesting experience. Discovering the fact that we all came here to express who we are, our identiry, our true self. Our tman wants to be expressed, and be brought into existence through the developing on new ways to communicate with each other. How important it is to be able to communicate well with each other. I wonder why we are not able to do it, but really there is no wonder. There is only a completee understainding that it is impossible. How can we aunderstand each other of we jhave different cultures, different ways of living, different life experiences. They say that if one of us would right now be teleported to the past 10000, physiologically she would be te same as those humans that would be there in that moment. How aazing it is to think about that. The biggest, biggest part of who we are expresses itself through epigenetics, a new area of discovery that is being studied at this moment, specially by a guy named Manollas Kellis, who is at the point of the spear in terms of wjat is being developed about epigenetics. What I understand about it is that it is the study of how our genetics are expressed differently because of the transformations of our environment.
