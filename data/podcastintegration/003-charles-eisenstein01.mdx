Charles: What are the lessons of history that can be used for greek people to understand what yes or no means? Given those lessons, what would your vote be?

Maria: After the fact that this was recorded 6.5 years ago, what has changed in the international perspective of Greece in these years? How has the internal dynamics of the country changed in this time?

- Charles spoke about a saying of Gandhi that was something like: First they will ignore you, then they'll fight you, then they'll .... and then you win. It seems like fighting is a necessary path to walk towards the resolution that comes when there is an understanding of each of the sides and a coming together afterwards (?)(Maybe this is a naive approach)
- It is interesting to hear how the dynamics of the country play their role in the story. Greece has given all their wealth in exchange for debt. They keep importing goods that they could produce, and sweating their resources to the outside when they have an amazing capacity for generating valuable stuff inside their own country. Why does this happen? It reminds me of Chile, which has an amazing abundance of different resources and we export the raw stuff so that other countries can profit from them. Why don't we have that capacity in here? How does the historical characteristics of our people, and the collective suffering of us throughout history determine this?
- Its impossible that Greece be able to pay their debt, given how much it grows and grows. One interesting way that Maria spoke about paying the debt in house is by doing community work.
- Young leaders have a smaller capacity for diplomacy. They care less about it than old ones.

It is interesting to listen to this almost 7 years since it was recorded, because there is a lot of similatiries with the processes that Chile has gone through in the last years. We had the referendum for a new constitution (which is being created right now), and a goverment that was elected that came to refresh what is going on here. How can the lessons that Greece has learned teach Chile how to make the progress that we need to make?

There is a very important topic related to community, and how the gathering of people around making the place where I live better can push us all forward. They spoke about the well being of one individual not being separated from the other, and this reminds me about the win-win approach that I've been trying to bring into my life lately (at least in thought). How can I bring more of this win-win approach into my life, into the business that I will create, and into the life of the people with which I interact? How can every interaction that I participate in be a win-win one?

I also wonder which is the way out of all this debt. Would there be a point where we collectively realize that infinite economic growth is a utopia and we build from that point? We find common solutions from there on? What happens with the debt of all the people that have gotten to that point? Is it erased and we start from scratch? This is completely unfair, but it is an important thing to realize because as they said, capitalism is based on debt.
