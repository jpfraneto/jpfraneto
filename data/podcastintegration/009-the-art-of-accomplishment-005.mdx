Joe: How does vulnerability open up space for a better understanding of myself?

- Vulnerability is a way of facing what generates fear in me, and as I approach a vulnerable state of communicating I get closer into transforming that fear of facing what I am truly into excitement about what can come after.

It is very intersting that I feel that this is one of the poscasts that have less stuck in my memory. There are two key things that happened differently today: I started listening to it in the house, as I was doing stuff that needed to be done there. Another thing that was different from previous days was that it was very cold outside, and my hands were freezing. Probably both of these things created conditions that didn't enable my retention of the content.

Anyway, it comes now to my consciousness the interaction that the voice inside my head has with what I do, how I interact, and how I face those things that I feel fear about. Joe spoke about vulnerability as the act of sharing my truth, and that is completely aligned with what I'm trying to bring into my life, understanding it as the means by which I evolve after facing my fears.

Another thing that is present is related to the evolution of what makes me vulnerable. He spoke about gandhi forgiving the person that shot him as he was dying. Was this a vulnerable act if he lived in this way for most of his existence? What would have been a vulnerable act in this case?

I listened to this episode and then was part of the last session of the connection course with sharon, and what came up there was two activities, the first one sharing what my internal voice was critizing me about all the time, and then what I enjoy about myself. It was very important to see how I felt with both of those different circumstances, and then have a conversation from there on which I was able to dive a little bit deeper into the VIEW mindset, stopping myself from being partial and just asking questions from wonder.
