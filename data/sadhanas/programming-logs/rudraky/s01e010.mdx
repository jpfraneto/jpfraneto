Dia 15. Today is the day when I remember the saying that the biggest generator of long term results is doing the work when you dont want to. I didnt want to wake up at 4.30 to do the kriya, nor code afterwards, and now Ill go to bed with my family with pride because I made it. I showed up, and made some good progress on the app. Now the functionality is working in a way that makes me feel good, you can create a kriya, you can go through it, and it feels good. The last thing I was doing was adding the functionality for adding comments to the kriya
