Dia 20.

Its very important to include in my workflow particular aspects of developing with react. Today I got errors for not adding the key prop to the elements that are thrown to my by the map function. This is important to have in mind.

The session was about cleaning up some major design issues, and perfecting the functionality of the app as a whole. The time catched me and I was not able to work on the understanding of how to pass granular props (a particular recording for example) into a page that is inside /recordings. The question of how to optimize this transfer of information so that I don't have to call multiple fetch requests to the api route is still without conclusion. The thing is that when I add a new comment the element gets updated, so how can I have a state that I can update but doesn't require a full update of the whole app (as it would happen if I had a react context).

Te question that comes to mind as I write this is: Is it possible to have multiple react contexts? If this was the case, I could have one for the recordings, other one for the kriyas, and a third one for more general stuff like the user information, etc.
