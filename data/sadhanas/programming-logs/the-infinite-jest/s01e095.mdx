I just realized that I'm almost in time for going to lunch with my family! I was not able to end up the session properly in this sunday morning, but it is what it is. This session brought a new understanding into me, on which I realized that I will work with the twitter api to tweet there every time a new recommendation is brought into the present in the main thread of the infinite jest. I will tweet something like "@jpfraneto recommended the following video for the eternal thread: ... ". It feels awesome to add this functionality, and I'm very excited about it. What I tried to do today was to connect the next-auth with the twitter api so that I can authenticate users with twitter, but I was not able to do it properly. This was a great showcase of how hard it is for me to go through the documentation of stuff properly, because I just want to get things done, and if I can move past the understanding of how to make it work, it feels better. This is a challenge because I should be doing it the other way around, having a clear understanding of how things work and then building from there. Holy shit, what an interesting journey this whole thing has been. I'm very excited about it, about where I am, and where I will go. I constantly see myself throughout the different phases of how I code, and it is very exciting to see my evolution as everything unfolds. I feel good.
