Woooow. What an amazing session. Today I worked in three different repos, because I realized that this place will be where I will capture all the curatory of content of my life. I will have in here podcasts, nature videos, space videos, science videos, music, etc. This will be the repository of all of that, and the main thread is to have an abstraction layer over what human music is. HM only has one thread running that plays music indefinetly... My goal here is to have 10. I worked on the layout of the front end of this, and connecting that to a server that I created that will be running the commands and threads needed for this to work in parallell. It will be a nice challenge to have everything working on the back, the same as human music does, but it seems like an amazing challenge. I'm very excited because in a way it is the consumation of all my learning process, on which I use everything that I have learned in order to achieve something fucking great. There will always be something happening in there, I will make the fucking best curatory of content in here, and whoever wants to have it will be able to come. And check out whatever video she wants. It's for that.

Another layer that I can add in the future of abstraction is to enable the possibility for different users. So every user has a page on which he has curatory of X content, and those are the ones that are displayed on her page. The website is like this: https://www.theinfinitejest.tv/jpfraneto. That is the crazy cool thing, to have the opportunity for all this to exist. The back end will be hosted in api.theinfinitejest.tv. Creating an api with which my two apps interact is amazing, and it is a skill that will open me a lot of doors. I'm pretty sure about this. It will be fucking great. What a great session today!
