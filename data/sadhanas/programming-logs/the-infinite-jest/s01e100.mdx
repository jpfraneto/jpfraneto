I have the feeling that the app is already there. In all the other projects that I have made, I have spent until the last day working on adding more functionality to it, making it more complex, making it look better by adding more stuff. This one is the complete opposite, since I have been just polishing it up. Making it look and feel more professional. There is a lot of things that need to be made better as the project is right now, and it is great to be in this track, to realize that I don't need to make it more complex, I just need to make it _cleaner_.

The way the user interacts with the content is critical for it to be functional, and that is what I'm focusing on right now. This forces me to better understand how the whole system is built, and be able to think deeply about what I want to show the user. How does the system interact with who comes here? What does it show? The sensation that I have right now as I progress with the project is one of madurity, of having reached a stage where less is more, which feels like a pace that makes me move towards the concept of _quality_. I want my software to be of quality. I want to have time to write the docs, to explain what it is about. To make it better through opening the doors for other developers to come in and share what they know. The other projects that I have built are like a giant black box of stuff, a big maze of code that I think that I don't even understand. Perharps what comes now with this project is me moving towards a place on which I can share with other people what I am, by writing clean code. _CLEAN CODE_! That is the key. That is where I need to move towards. It feels good to do this!
