[[142022V1205]]

Time to ship the last project of The Open Source Factory, time to finish this stepping stone into the unknown for me. I have done a lot in the last year for pushing this project forward, to teach myself how to code, to go through what is needed to do in order to create stuff that doesn't exist. It has been very challenging at times, but it is very rewarding, because I have something that I can show to the world. 'Look, I made this, with passion, with heart, with consistency, with discipline'. It may not be the most good looking thing in the world, but it works, it has a purpose, and it is there for people to use. That is what I bring to the world, and I'm happy to be able to share it.
