Wow, I'm getting to session number 100. Reaching the end of this Open Source Factory journey. One of the biggest challenges that I face right now is making sense of everything that has happened throughout this year. I started learning programming as a means to be able to work remotely, and right now I'm in a place where I don't know which are the next steps. Some days I feel very lonely thinking about working remotely, and others I feel connected to that idea because I think about having my office downtown, as a cultural center, and it feels great. What if I could do that? What if I commited to the work that I was doing before, and I did what I'm supposed to do? I have had this dream for a long time, why my resistance is pushing it away from me? It makes no sense. It is time for me to stick with what I know I have to do, and stay true to that. Some days I say: 'No, programming is not for me...' But how am I making justice to the path that I have walked since 2020 if I don't give it a shot? It is hard, there is a lot of imposter syndrome going on in me right now, but I need to move past that. It is time for me to be strong and try hard. I need it. I have to do it. There is an amazing place downtown that needs my energy, and that is the steps that my heart have been telling me for a long time for me to take. I need this input of mind energy, of pushing the boundaries, and I need to find balance between that and my family. Am I going to be able to do it? It just depends on me. How can I know if I don't give it a shot?

How would my days feel like if there was no doubt? If I just did the work?

I'm creating my yoga proyect and the person that is helping me has told me how valuable it will be for the kids that I'm aiming to. How is it that she is able to see that value and I'm not? What does it take for me to believe in myself, in my ideas? Go jp, go. It's time for you to shine, you have been for too long hiding below a rock. The world needs your energy.
