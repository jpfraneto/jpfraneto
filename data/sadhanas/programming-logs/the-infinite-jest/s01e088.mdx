Holy shit this was a very intense weekend. Just today only I went through 3 kundalini yoga classes, and my brain is kind of fried. I'm very tired, it is 22:22 in the night, but I managed to put in the hours necessary to do some progress in the app.

I worked mainly in the functionality of the eternal loop of videos, and it will be a interesting thing to see tomorrow if it worked or not. I gave my best today, and I go to bed with that in mind.
