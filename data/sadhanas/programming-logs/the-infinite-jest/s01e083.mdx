Today I worked around a lot of the core functionalities of the app. I have it up and running, with the connections with heroku, with the youtube API, with mongodb. I felt that today was a very good session, and I feel in peace with it. I'm making some good progress here. I feel that the simplicity that I brought into the landing page will be very appealing, and it is important for me to understand how to build it in a way that is conducent to getting the most out of this simplicity. I wonder if it is a good idea to have both projects in the same repo, since I could have theinfinitejest.tv with this very simple landing page as just a static project (only html, css and javascript). That would make it extremely easy to use, and it would make the fact of creating it as the garden of eden of css (something on which other developers can add their styling, and with this create a different theme for when they come to the page. Developers from all over the world can choose how they want this thing to look like. That is the fun part. That is the interesting part.).

I have been dreaming with this project for a looooong time, and it is just amazing to be creating it right now. I feel excited, I feel motivated, and I'm very willing to work with other people. With a chef and designer to which I'm going to share the website with. The whole idea. I'm going to show him what I'm dreaming, and see which is his reaction. What if there was no particular language of the videos? They are language-less. Only images. Only sounds. That is very interesting. This is the place without languages. Even that level of simplicity. How can the infinite jest get simpler? How could it be more addictive? It is all about curatory. Which is the most addictive curatory that one can create? I wonder... I wonder... I very much wonder. And that is the exploration of this place, to connect with my spirit of wanting to curate, of wanting to bring healing into the world. I will bring healing into the world. I'm sure about that. This place is for that. I feel motivated to keep it going.
