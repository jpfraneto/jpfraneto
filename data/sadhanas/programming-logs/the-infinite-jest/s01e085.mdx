Again I don't know where I'm going with this thing. It is great that this is the last project in a way, because it has been fucking hard to face the challenge that I don't know how to make progress.

I don't know yet what I'm building, and it frustrates me a little bit because I have been dreaming of a project for a long time.

What are the questions that I need to ask myself so that I can understand how to make progress? What to build?

How do I imagine people using this thing? How do I imagine them interacting? What will this thing say about me? There is a lot in this related to the infinite jest, the book by david foster wallace, and probably it makes sense to bring more of it into what I'm doing. How can I better connect with the spirit of the book, with the suffering that is shared through it, with depression itself? There is a big pain in the book, and this project tries to get that pain and transform it into something that can be useful for humanity.

What is that?

I don't know. But I'll keep trying to find out.
