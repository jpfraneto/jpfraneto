In todays session I decided to add various layers of complexity into the system, because I want it to be more complete than what it was before. I added all the layers of abstraction that I had thought of before: Now there is users, and each user can have her own media types, which will be running as a loop 24/7 in the system. I don't know how I will manage this from a DB sense, how it will all work out, but I'm building the system for that. It's quite interesting and fun to be creating this project, and I'm excited about it. I'm learning a lot, and being challenged by it a lot. It is very interesting to be working with the front end in one repo and with the backend in another side, and connecting them through the api. Both systems are connected to the same database, and that makes it also very interesting.

I will have to do a proper documentation of this project one day, because it will be very complex. I guess that I could know better data structures so that i could bring more ease of use into it, and for it to be faster, but this is what is going on right now, and it is ok like that.

The landing page will have the summary of everything that is going on in the project. From all the media that will be in the present it will chose a random one, and it will work like that infinitely. I wonder how I will make this happen. I wonder how I will make everything happen. But for now, I'm doing great progress, and these have been very intense work sessions but they have me very motivated.
