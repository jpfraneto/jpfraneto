Today I entered complexity mode, so that I could leverage all the knowledge that I have gathered from the past months on which I have been working with NEXTJS. As this project is the culmination of my path in the open source factory, I decided to go back to the basics in one hand by having a simple express app without any framework on the frontend, so that I can display the simplest pages of them all: www.theinfinitejest.tv. Here there will be only a title, an iframe with a video, and buttons for changing the layout of what is seen with custom css files (people will be able to add these so that they can display the thing as they want. This is the interesting part.).

This part is linked by a button with the other big application, which will be built with nextjs, and accessed by the home.theinfinitejest.tv route. In this app I will add all the functionality for interacting with the whole system, and it will be mandatory to have an account to enter here. This will be the interesting part. This is what I'm thinking right now, perharps it changes in the future. But today I made a huge design decision, because all the major back end logic for the system to work indefinetly will be hosted in the heroku server and accessed through an api route that I will build, and the user-interaction-part will be the next app. This decision is for adding simplicity on one side, but with the hidden complexity on the other one. I'm very excited with where this will lead me to. Today was an important day.
