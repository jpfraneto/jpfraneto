Wow, I'm almost ready. And before coming to work I talked to my parter and told her that I feel good. This project feels good. Before coming here I used it in my house and it is such an interesting thing to have something like this. On one side, an eternal thread of content which I can come and tap on any moment to see what is going on, to connect with what a hidden intelligence (pure randomness) is wanting to tell me. On the other side, it is a great place on which to store all the media that I want to store, and index it within categories. It will make my life more organized, I'm sure about that.

Ending the project I feel like it has been a success. The most important part of this whole thing has been having the opportunity to demostrate myself that I can be disciplined, no matter if there is an external authority pushing me to be like that. I do it because I care, and that is very valuable in this day and age. I haven't been able to fully recognize that, but it is important as I enter this new process of sharing who I am with the market, to have it in mind. My main focus has been on building soft skills that can make me be very valuable, and within them also push my technical skills and creative ones by being persistent and creating all the projects that I have built. I'm close to the moment of finding resolution in all the path that I have walked, and it is amazing to be in this place. I will finish this as good as I can!
