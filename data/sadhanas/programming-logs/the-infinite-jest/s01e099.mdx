Today I got into simplicity mode. What if things were easy, what if I took away all the complexity? I want this place to be as simple as it can be, and today I moved in that direction. It feels good. It was a good session, I was in a different mood than other times, more chilled, at a slower pace. I went to have a chat with my woodworking mentor before the session, not wanting it to be different from what it was, just enjoying the moment. It felt good!
