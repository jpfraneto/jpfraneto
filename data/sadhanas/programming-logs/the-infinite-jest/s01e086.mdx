I'm making some good progress in the way that the project is built in my mind. Today I realized that it would be great to have it as a place where remote workers from all over the world could gather, and use their offices as a place which can give back a lot to their local community. What if every remote worker shared a little bit about the conditions on which they work in their particular country? How could people from all over the world come together by this means?

It is veeery interesting to be writing about this and through that process be discovering the potential of what I'm building here. This is a coworking space on the internet, on which we commit to sit down and focus so that we can all push it hard. What if there were deep work sessions organized every two hours and then there was time out to connect in a chilled way? What if there was a 24/7 deep work zoom room and also a 24/7 watercooler zoom room? How would this feel like? What if there were breakout rooms in this last one so that people could share with each other what they are working in? How would a world that is connected like this work?

It feels fucking interesting! I'm looking forward to see how this evolves. It looks very promising and interesting. What if there was a webcam 24/7 pointing to the TV of the office? I'm full of ideas, and the important part of them is bringing them into something concrete. Today I made progress on that. It's building momentum.
