[[292022IV1250]]
Finishing a new week, and important one, because there were a lot of days on which I worked in a way that makes me feel proud. I'm making some interesting progress with the whole world that I'm creating, without too much trouble for it to be a little bit not in order. I'm working on 4 different repos now, and that can make things weird and complicated, but I have what I'm building in mind and with that I'm able to move forward. Today I'll contact a designer, which makes me feel very excited. It will be amazing to bring into my craft the eye and experience of someone that knows how to do things. Let's continue pushing it forward. It was a great week, and now I go to celebrate with my family.
