Today I started this new project, and the challenge that I'm facing right now is activating the different routes so that I can set it up in a way that is functional so that I can start building the project from the ground up. For this one, I will create a back end server with Node JS and the front end with react. 

Why am I not using NextJS? Because I want to have functions running 24/7 on the server that update the videos that will be displayed for the user in each of the categories, and I think that by doing it like this I will have more flexibility in the process of creating what I am dreaming about. 

I encountered a big wall as I was trying to make this thing work, since there is a new version of react there is something that doesn't work as it should, and I was not able to do the routing properly. It was very frustrating, but I know I will make it tomorrow and it will start working. I'm confident about that!
