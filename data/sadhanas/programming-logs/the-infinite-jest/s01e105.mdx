Today I felt out of my focus. It was hard to keep it because the puppies are giving me a hard time, and it was hard for me to start the work because I had to get them vaccinated, and they were making a lot of noise, which made me a little bit nervous. I'm also trying to understand how to fit my yoga practice into the day, because these days I have been doing it at 8 pm and that is very late for me. It is not working properly. I think I need to start doing it earlier so that I can have more time in the morning to do stuff, because today I started coding at 12:50. That is not the best timing!

On the level of the app I'm developing, I feel tired of this whole process of coming up with ideas and being alone in the development of them. It has been very tough to make my way through and understand what does the system need from my creativity to give it what it has to have. I don't realy know what it has to have, so it is tiring to be coming up with ideas all the time, and kind of running in circles. But this is the last stretch, it is the last effort, and I need to be able to make it properly so that I end this process as good as I can. Let's do it!
