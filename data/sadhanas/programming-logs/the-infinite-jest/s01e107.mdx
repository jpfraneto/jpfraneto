What a great session this has been. I feel very comfortable when I have definite tasks, and all these days have been about styling and making the functionalities that I envision for the app work. It is all about polishing the edges for making the product smoother. I feel good with that. I was not able to dive into the mobile functionality, so that is something that I will need to work tomorrow in order to make the progress that I need to make. But for now, it is all going well. Lets go!
