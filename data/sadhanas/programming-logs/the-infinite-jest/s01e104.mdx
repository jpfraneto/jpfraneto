Finishing a new session on which I worked on the functionality of the app. Now every video within a mediatype is played consecutively and I'm adding a functionality on the individual video to share the link with a timestamp that will display the video in that point. Right now I can't write any more because my family is here and I will go and enjoy them, but it was a great session!
