[[282022IV1158]]
Here I am again, ending this session after it being a little bit weird. I did not feel very comfortable with the pace on which i started working, and also my focus in it. It was not the best session of them all, but I managed to put in a big chunk of time. I worked in the abstraction of components so that it is better structured, and I also deployed to vercel to see how it works in production right now. As I write this I'm waiting for it to be deployed.

I don't have too much to say right now here. I showed the app to my brother and it is very interesting for me to talk about it, and through that help myself to understand better how to make further progress. I'm not creating this for a particular user, I'm creating it as an expression of my pure creative way of doing things. There is no particular goal with it, just explore, explore and explore into what I can create. That is the interesting part :).
