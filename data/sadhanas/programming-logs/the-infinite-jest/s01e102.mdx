[[082022V2026]]

Definetly this session teaches me that my time for programming is not in the night. I don't feel it completely, I'm tired. But today was the mothers day, and it was important for me to spend time with my family after not having been with them the whole week. That's why I ended up working in the night, and it is what it is. I was able to connect the app with twitter (which is quite easy with a package that i found) and now every time that in the database there is a new recommendation it will be tweeted in my profile. This feels pretty cool, and tomorrow I'll check how it worked throughout the night. But right now it seems that it is working, and it is a core functionality of the project. I wonder if it would be able to create the thread of every user, and the authentication was built upon every user... How would it be if I could offer this opportunity with every one? And that every user had its own infinite jest page, with his own content. Wouldn't that be cool? I don't really know how to do this from a developmental standpoint, but it would be a very cool idea. It's part of how this app can grow, towards what. It seems like a very cool addition to it to be able to implement all this. But for now, this is what it is, and I'm working on polishing it so that it looks like a piece of art. I want to put my signature in the bottom of it, and share it with the world with pride. Then I will go about looking for a remote job on which I can use all my skills, and that is part of what the future will bring to me. For now, it is time to go and enjoy being with the amazing woman that my partner is. Peace out!
