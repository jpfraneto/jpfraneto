I can see that the whole architecture of the application is a mess. Haha. As soon as someone new comes here and tries to dig into the UX, there will be something fundamental in there. But it is part of the whole thing, the most important part here is to have the app up and running. To convey the message that is behind it, rather than to build something perfect. I don't really understand what I'm building, I'm just doing it, and the process of building stuff like this is coming to an end, since this is my last week working as I'm working in the open source factory.

Today I worked on the functionalities of how the front end integrate with the eternal loop of the back end. I would love to have more than one universal thread for the project, but that is a challenge from the standpoint of memory. Perharps I can do it with my profile only, but I guess it is a little bit late for that. This week I will focus on having the app running in a good way. I use it, and within that use I realize what is missing and what should be better. No time for adding more complexity, just for making it nicer to the user.
