Today was very hard for me to start focusing since I was with my mind helping patricia with the present for my brother's birthday, and we talked quite a while by the phone. It was a great conversation, but I feel that the progress that I made today in the app was quite messy. This connects me with how amazing this profession is, since you come every day with what you have that day, and it may be something shitty that throws a lot of what you have done before to the garbage. But it also connects me to the importance of the long term, since it is very hard to throw it to the garbage, because of the log systems that are implemented. I can always go back to the place where I was yesterday, and that is a huge advantage on having git. There is always a record of what I have done (if I commit it), and that is very powerful.

I'm finishing this project, not understanding completely what it is about, but trusting in the process that has gotten me here. It will be a reviewer of sounds, and I'm perfecting the way it is built so that I can use it afterwards. I need something like this, where to have my stuff organized, and I'll see what comes up from here.
