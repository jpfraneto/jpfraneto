Today I feel with my brain a little bit foggy, and it is because yesterday I had an encounter with my father doing something that made me feel really angry, and today in the morning we had a conversation on which I also felt that anger. It is important for me to dive into what made that present, and through that understanding be able to feel better. But it impacted my programming, and it was because I was in the house late, after having slept till 'late' (6.30 am). It's funny that when I write this I realize that my concept of late has been built around the fact that I think that waking up at 4.30 is the best for me, and not having been able to do it frustrates me a little bit. This week I have been lazy in this regard, but also enjoying being in the house and cuddling with my partner in the bed in the morning. This is something that I need to work on, because I put the alarm at 5.55 and then woke up 40 minutes later, with that time struggling with sleep that is not very helpful. What if I just woke up and leave behind the bs? I would be more productive in my whole morning and I'll have a clearer mind to engage with my family in the afternoon. But my little girl is very nice in the morning, so here is something that I haven't resolved in this whooooole year and it brings weird thoughts into myself.

Anyway, I did the work again, I consistently came here and did the best work that I could, and that is what adds up.
