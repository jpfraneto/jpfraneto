Massive session that I started 'late' because I stayed in the house longer to be with my family and give them my love. It is funny that I always talk about the timing of the session, as if it was the most important part of it. Can't you notice how much I have been dealing with the issues of time lately? Today I'm skipping lunch with my family and that feels kind of weird. I think I prefer to come in the morning and do my stuff early, so that I can have as a present from life to interact with them in the afternoon. But I love trying out new stuff, and this is a new exercize on that.

The session went good, I played a lot with the spotify API and made some progress with it, dealing with the albums that are part of my library, and trying to build a player in the site that enables me to do the work of playing the music inside it.
