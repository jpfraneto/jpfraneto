Today was a great day since I got back to waking up really early. I need to fix a little bit how I manage my time in the morning, because I woke up at 5.08 and ended up starting the kriya at 6, which means that I took a long time for this. It would be ideal to wake up at 4.30 and start the kriya at 5 and then start work around 6, but I'll get there without stress. Today was a good programming session, on which I'm making some great progress in the app, and that makes me feel happy. The functionality seems great, interesting, and I have worked smoothly this last days, getting to do stuff that I did not know how to do, which is very helpful for my learning process.

I'm motivated by this project, it will be useful for me as a place where to come and watch interesting stuff and comment it. It will be a repository of great stuff, and as I write this I come up with new ideas of what to implement in it to make it more interesting even. I'm happy with it, I'm motivated. Go go go.

ps: Today was the last day of my 40 days practicing kirtan kriya. I want to use this space to congratulate myself, and to acknowledge the work that I have done. I've made a lot of progress tuning my nervous system, and that pays off every day. Well done jp.
