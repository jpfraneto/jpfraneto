I'm beginning to understand what this is all about. I spent a lot of time trying to build this website from the idea that it would be hosted in a DB, but that doesn't make ANY sense because I need to be the owner of my own data and having it in mdx files gives me control over it much more than in another way. It would make a bit more sense to have it in a DB if there was information added from other users, but for now it is only a static website on which I'll share stuff (mostly with myself).

By having the files locally I have more control on them, I'll learn better to write markdown, and it will be good overall for what I intend to do. The most important thing that I want to bring into this place is writing, and because of that the only thing that is important is to have a clear flow for writing. Having the ordered files will give me this.
