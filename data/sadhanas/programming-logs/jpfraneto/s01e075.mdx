I'm realizing what this whole thing is about. Until now, I always wanted to create generic ways of doing things, so that I could share it with the world and help people use it. But now I realized that this is MY system, on which I will do the work. I need to build it for myself.

Pending:

- Album of the day review in Music.
- Routes for all the logs: sadhanas, programming, etc.
- Routes for the education.
