Holy shit, this session got clearer. Last week I realized that this website will be the frame on which I build the structure that I need to make the progress that I want to make every day. In this structure, the key component is the sadhana, which is the thing that I repeat every day in order to get to where I want to get. I have built my life around these sadhanas, and it makes absolute sense to have them here organized and for them to be the main content of my website. Tomorrow I will have to work on the creation of the different sadhanas on the database, and how to add information to each of them so that I can afterwards display them in the website.

This will be a challenge, since I already have a few sadhanas that I can import as information to the DB and with that start working. I have the office, which I wrote for 100 days as I was building human music, and I also have this one, the information from the open source factory last sprint. It makes a lot of sense to start with this ones, and from there move forward. This looks much helpful that other things that I have been doing, because it will be a means for having agency in my own path and with that be able to track the progress that I make. I feel good after today's progress, since yesterday it was shitty as I was hangovered and high and filled with food haha. But now I'm better, and I feel good today!
