Today in the morning I went to my mothers house and checked my email and stumbled upon [this](https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-untethered-soul-the-roadmap-of-my-personal-growth-part-1/) article by Tiago Forte, which apart from bringing very interesting insights into my awareness related to the importance of spiritual growth in what I'm doing, brought the importance of the website as a neat place on where to read content. The most important aspect of my website will be the content that I'll share, and today I worked in the understanding of what to do to display it properly. It involved checking a lot Lee Robinson's website and the repo where the code is shared, and understanding better what MDX is about.

This was reverse engineering at the serving of my purpose of communicating with the world. I need to be concise, and share my message clearly so that there is not too much noise. I realized yesterday that having the information in the DB is not worth it, since the whole website is static and I won't be producing 8 pieces every day. I'll only produce one related to my yoga practice, one related to my programming path and also a blog post once in a while. Aaahhh, and also the podcast. That is an important part. The podcast layout. That is the work for tomorrow, all those other layouts. The important question is: What kind of content do I want to share with the world?
