Things that I did not intend came up at the end, which made it kind of stressful but fun. I'm completely not comfortable with how the sadhana part ended up, but it is what it is, and I can't control it anymore. I have to set myself free from the burden of not having done it perfectly!

Overall, the project was great because I was able to come here and work and work and practice. That is the important part. There were a lot of challenges related to how I would do things, but I think that overall I did a good job. I feel good. Now I will record the final video and consider this done. BUT! I need to come here and write about the projects and the pieces of art, so that I can finish the content of the website properly.
