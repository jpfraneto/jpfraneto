I wonder how this project looks from the outside. The thing that makes me happier is the fact that there is never something that is 'done', in the sense that it is a static thing. This project will evolve in the future, as right now I'm only working on things that are important now and training my building things muscle, but after a while, as i hatch out of the egg that I have built for myself, I'll be able to bring more understanding of what is valuable of this place. But right now this two things are the important ones, the sadhana and the podcast, and that is what I want to bring it.

Today was an important session because I had to bring into my awareness a sense of peace because of not being able to do the work when I intended to do it. I wanted to work early in the morning, but I had to go and get some stuff for my little girl to eat lunch, so I was not able to work when I had scheduled it. I had to be flexible, and today was very important to bring this. The whole thing that I'm working here with TOSF and all that I'm doing in my life is training myself to be flexible, to understand that I'll not be able to do everything and it is ok. It's important to establish the boundaries and create a safe space for exploration in the house, and we'll make it with nacha, I'm sure.
