I have a lot of ideas that come to me in the day to day, but then I come into this session to do the work and all that goes somewhere funny, so then I start destroying everything that I have made and starting from scratch. There is a big mess in the way that the app is structured right now, and the work of today was an answer to that. With the willingness to make it better, to make it more straightforward, to make it be the working place where I'll share what I believe in with the world.

I don't really know into what this project is converging. It feels blurry. I have been jumping from one side to the other, not really knowing how to build it. It feels frustrating at times, and I feel that I'm not doing enough progress. But what is progress, anyway? What I encounter as I come here and do the work, and me realizing where that comes from. That is progress. That is what I need to move forward. That is the whole point of this thing, to experience what comes to me when I feel doubts, when I feel that I'm not doing the correct thing. To follow my heart. At the end of the day, what I'm sharing here is what I believe in, it is who I am, and it is important to have that in mind so that I can create something valuable for the reader. This will be the place where I will come every day to write, to think through writing. That is what I want to showcase here... The writing. And for that what needs to happen is to be simple. To just do things in a simple way, so that I can organize everything and know where to go if I want to write about A, about B, or about C. I know that I'm making progress, even if it doesn't seem like.
Congratulations JP, for a new week of coming here and facing your demons.

As I write this I realize that I feel lighter than before. There have been more stressful times, but now I'm making peace with everything and it feels much better. I know that everything is where it should be.
