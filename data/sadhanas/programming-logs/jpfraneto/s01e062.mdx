What a great session today, with the clear intention in mind, and how to execute it properly. I worked on the sadhana life path, and it feels good to have it there. Tomorrow I will have to work in the functionality for adding a new building block into the sadhana, so that I can start going in there after I end up with something that I did in that particular day for building that sadhana into a reality. I have material with which to work, and it feels good to be implementing this, which defines me as a human being. I'm not defined by what I have studied, fuck that. I'm defined by the passion that I put into how I work on achieving what I see as important in my life. The commitment to do the work is what I want to share in my website. That is what matters to me.
