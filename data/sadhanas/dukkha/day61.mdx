I think it was when I was having a shower today that I realized why I like writing so much. It feels like it is the activity on which I can be more focused, more present, because I can do it without any other kind of distraction. I can bring my whole presence into it, and as soon as I loose myself in the process, it starts to kick in as a potent drug. I have not been able to enter that flow completely yet, there are always some things going on in the inside (and in the outside) that don’t let me enter the creative flow with full power right on, but I’m working on that, realizing which is the way on which I have to organize myself so that I can push through the session with everything I’ve got.

Yes. Because each time that I sit down and start Doing The Work, it is game on. It is me starting to realize that the power for doing what I have to do is just within me, and it is my mission to bring it about so that I can share more and more of what is inside me through the creative expression that it is to just write these words, one after the next one. I guess that each word that I write is an exploration into what is present when I am fully present. Who is the one that is present? How does it feel? Where is it felt? Those are things that come to my mind as reminders of the way on which I need to face this process so that I can bring more and more of myself into it. So that I can become it. I have not done that yet, it is very hard for me, but I will. I will move towards that. That is the thing, I’m still not able to make my work a ritual. Heck, I’m not even able to make my meditation a ritual. I do it every day, very consistently, but I’m not able to enter the process with something that may feel like a ritualistic approach. I just sit down, and see what happens. I don’t commend to any particular being, I don’t call anyone to join me, I don’t express any concepts. I just am. And that is the thing that makes some noise in me, because it feels like just something else that I do. There is nothing sacred in it. And here, coming to do my writing, it feels like the same. I just come, do my thing, and then go away with what was left. What is it that is left? I don’t really know, I just explore it every day and hopefully one day I will be able to look back and check it out. But for now, it is just the story that I’m telling myself in the writing, and it is just what shows up as every word that is written in every moment. They flow by, and I’m just here sitting down and witnessing that process. I’m the witness. I am the one that gets surprised by what happens.

And today I want to start this writing by asking myself a question. There is an aspect of myself that asks this question to another aspect of myself. That division always in place, making its noise in Maya, the illusion of duality. Why breathwork? Why am I in this place educating myself and training myself so that I can be the best breathwork facilitator that I can? Why did I join that training to be a facilitator? Good question, and it is the sum of everything that I have done. Everything that I’ve been is summed in the fact that I’m training to be a breathwork facilitator. And I’m working on that because it matters to me. Because I want to bring healing to myself, and with that, to the world.

If I could ship to your house a bag of mushrooms and hold your hand as you go through the process of disintegration of the psyche that takes place after you do something like that I would. But there is something about that that makes a bit of noise in me. There are people that are hesitant and reluctant to entheogens, they don’t trust what will happen, they don’t trust what it’ll bring. And I can’t be everywhere at the same time. So I need a technique that is more readily available for everyone, and that’s when I come to the breath. I think that every one of us needs to go through a process of dissolution of the stories that we have been telling ourselves throughout time, about who we are, about where we are going, etc. There is so much in there that needs to be integrated, and for me breathwork has been the means by which I have been able to develop presence so that I can fully express myself in the present moment. I am already complete here and now, and if I’m not able to realize that and experience life from that realization it is because there is something that is making noise, there is a fog, in between my experience as a human being (what I know thing of as the sum of my perceptions) and the way on which I act in the world. For me, breathwork is the means by which this separation is resolved, so that I can live more and more in the present moment. The aspects of separation between my self and my experience of the world are built upon the stories that are being told inside my own mind, and the way on which I have been able to transform this division into something that I can work on is with the breath. It is the scalpel that helps me take out what is not doing me good so that I can leave what is helping. What will bring more and more of myself.

I have been all my life searching, and wanting to be in service. I have travelled many roads, which I will begin to explore in this writing. That’s part of the integration process. And the mistake that I’m doing here as I write is wanting to have it correct right away. Being able to write down the perfect thing so that I can have it ready as I finish. It doesn’t work like that, because there needs to be a process of unleashing what is inside so that I can understand what is inside, so that I can fully integrate why I am where I am. I have commited to make breathwork the spinal chord of my life, so that I can help people bringing them into the navigation of who they are with the breath, and it is a process that will enable me to become more and more of what I already am. I’m here, doing my thing, because it is the moment for that. It is the moment on which I’m able to integrate everything that I do into a way that I can embody. Everything that I am is presence, and in this practice I’m able to just have that presence be in service of whoever is it that I’m helping. Allowing that person to open up the creativity that is within. The pure and magical and unique expression of creativity that breathwork is. That is the thing. I’m here so that I can embody everything that I have been by holding space. I’m here to learn how to hold space for the process of transformation of other human beings.

And that process of transformation starts from the embodiment of what is already there, and has always been. That is why the podcast that I’m creating is called Timeless Integration, and I have not been able to embody that name completely because I have been running around with the idea, going round and round, travelling to the moon and back to return to the basics. Where it all started. That is the thing, that is the place where it all started. That is the game that I’m playing, and that I have been playing all this time. That is the open source factory. Everything that I am is already here, and it is time to integrate it so that I can fully embody everything that I am into a way of being, into a way of existing, into a way of relating to my own and unique reality. That is the game that I’m playing, and I have not been able to relate to it completely because of all the running around, but it is enough. Is it ever enough? I don’t really know.

Ok, so now it is time to jump to a place in the arc of my life on which I can start grasping the sense that will make me understand why I’m here. Is there an explanation? I remember asking a good friend that I have for a person that could help me in my process of evolution. She send me back the contact of a friend of hers that she spoke about as a witch. She told me that this other woman was a witch, with superpowers, so there I was, just coming back to connect with this witch woman and realizing that she was going to be the one that would help me connect deeper with what I already am. And what is it that I already am? Pure presence. So yes, I realized that I wanted to work with her, and the technique that she used was conscious connected breathing. I don’t think I had heard about it before, but I definitely had been working a lot with the breath because of all the kundalini yoga that I was practicing and all the Wim Hof Breathing that I have been doing. I even did a 10 week online training with wim hof, just on my own, with the power of my willingness to evolve. There I was, every day as I woke up, going through the breathing sessions and the exercizes that he was guiding me through. Bringing into my life the breath, the cold showers, and the meditation that was an integral part of the method. So yes, between that and the kundalini yoga I was very used to work with my breath as a means for deeper exploring my present reality, so it was something kind of easy for me to just go into it with commitment and purpose. And trust in her guide. Trust in what she had to share with me. So there I was, just going through that, and going every week through a session with her, on which we had a conversation and then I breathed. I don’t know the impact that it had in me, really, because of all the other things that I was doing. I could not tell which effect that I was witnessing in my life was because of what, I was just pushing through it and bringing the best of who I am to every circumstance on which I was. I was just being. That is something that is so hard for me to realize, because I’m always expecting that I should be something else. That the purest expression of who I am is something different than this. Something deeper. A different realm of perceptions. I’m always expecting my experience of reality to be something different, and in that quest, I get lost. I search and search and search and eventually I end up in the same place on which I started the searching because it is the same place where I have always been. I like thinking of myself as someone that is evolving in every moment, but the truth is that all the evolution that I will ever be is already here, it is just my work to lift that fog and be able to witness what is left.

And that is what I am. What is left. And the breath has helped me to better realize what that is. It has brought more clarity into my being. More connection to the source, and because of that, an enhanced capacity for being creative. To manifest my own truth into something that has an impact in the world because of my creative expressions. The breath brings me towards the manifestation of my truth in the world by embodying it through the act of creation. That is the thing. I am, therefore I create. That is the evolution of the old adage ‘I think, therefore I am’. The creative act is a necessity for us as humans, and we haven’t been able to realize that yet because of all the constraints that have been in place.

And that’s why breathwork is so important for me, because it is the means that I have discovered to help humans to develop a deeper connection with their creative expression. To the unique jewel that each of them brings, and how that jewel is expressed in the world by what they decide to bring into it. Each thing that we do can be seen through the lens of it being a creative expression, each conversation is an act of manifestation in some way, and if we start witnessing life and living it as an act of constant creation it will get more and more amazing. And bringing breathwork into my life and being able to guide other people through these journeys is something that helps me walk that path. It helps me become more me, because it involves being in service of the process of others. I have been a long, long time travelling on my own, walking the path on my own, and this is the means by which I will be able to walk it with others.

I’m here because I have a dream, and that dream, or vision, is a podcast on which I will interview one person every day as she goes through the process of sharing with me the album of music that has had the deepest impact in their life. Since I was going through this breathwork therapy sessions I had that dream as a manifestation that was going on inside me, and it is time for me to bring that dream into life and embody it as a reality every day. I love connecting with people, I love the randomness that comes from what can be built through the internet, and it is time for me to bring more and more of that into the world. I truly believe that music is an answer to a lot of the problems that we are having, because it is a language that doesn’t have a particular representation in the world. It is not necessarily connected to a particular tribe, we can all resonate with it. And there is enormous value for me in that, and that is why I want to bring more and more of it into the world. That’s why I want to make music, and become capable of helping people to travel into the depths of their own being through the sounds that I will create. I want to be able to merge the sounds of the albums that they choose into an original creation that can bring about the manifestation of everything that they have inside. I truly want to dissolve myself into the music, so that I can transform their reality through it. That’s the thing. I have done 4 sessions until now, and just sharing with them the affirmations as they go through the session doesn’t feel completely sincere for me. There is always some noise going on inside me related to that not being the path forward, because I have something different to share from the inside. What is inside me is the willingness to explore the journey through consciousness of that person by just creating something tailored for her. And I need that process to be open, to be public, so that the whole world can be in service of the transformation of that particular human being. That is the thing. I have always dreamt about this as an integral part of the radio that I’m creating, and it is one of the pieces that are there being fitted into what I’m doing. I’m still not clear with how the pieces fit together, but I’m doing my best so that I can understand it. But I know that the podcast is in there, asking the person which is the album that they would take to the other side, and with the answer having an open and free flow conversation into whatever comes. It doesn’t need to be something particular, it doesn’t need to have an agenda. It can be whatever comes, whatever is alive in us in that moment, and it is alright with that. And that is the magic in it being live, because I avoid the need for editing it afterwards, and there is much more truth present if we know that we are live. We can jump right into it. There is no touching base before or anything like that. We just dive into what is being created, and it is perfect like that. And I think about the piece of art that I wanted to create and send as an NFT, but the thing is that it may be better just to share the audio of the album remixed as an NFT. What if I remix the album and play it as the person is going through the session? Is that something that makes sense? I’m not sure. The only thing that I’m sure is that I want to create this space where I can interview people with their truth, have them go through a breathwork session listening to the album of their choice, and then coming back and asking them: Tell me who you are. Just reporting what is there. Just sharing the truth of who they are, right there, in that moment. That is where the value will come from. I still haven’t realized how this will happen, but I just know that if I’m consistent enough it will happen. People will show up. And that is all what I need, for people to show up. With their truth. With their own and particular truth. And Twitter will be the means by which I will bring about this truth, sharing what we come up with in there. That is the magic of the game, that is the public square and mine is the music store that is on the side of the square. It is the coolest place in town, it is just that you don’t realize it yet. I will build the coolest place in town. It is time for that.

And what will that bring into my life? I guess that at the end of the day I’m doing the stuff for selfish reasons. I’m doing it for myself, so that the consequences of what I do will create in those that I touch something that will make them feel better. So why am I doing this? Because I have a deep need for connection. I want to be part of communities, but no community is enough for me because they are all interesting in their own way. Every community has something to add to me, because they are all special in some kind of way. There is value in each and every one of those communities, and it is time for me to acknowledge that so that I can fully embody why I love this idea to be based on randomness. That is the thing. I love this thing to be random. I want it to be based in randomness. Who is the one that is going to be interviewed? How can I even decide that? I can only decide how am I going to choose, and my choice is that it will be absolutely randomized. The same as Human Music, there will be a poll of people that have shared their album and I will choose randomly from all of them. Something came to my mind right now related to the podcast, and it is the fact that people don’t usually think of themselves as someone that could be interviewed for a podcast.

It is almost impossible for someone to just show up and say: I want to be on this podcast. It doesn’t work like that. It needs to be me the one that asks them to come. With intention, and with the willingness to share an open conversation. To just be myself. That is everything that is truly needed: me to be myself. That is something that showed up today as I was journaling, the need that I have to just be myself. And when am I myself? When I allow myself to just be. I allow myself to explore what feels fun. There are no preconceptions related to what should be or not. Nothing that I can think about of before the conversations will be as important as what happens when the conversation starts. That is the means by which I become more and more of myself, just by having these open conversations and see what shows up.

The ultimate goal of the whole thing is to just have fun. I just want to have fun with this thing, I just want to fuck around with the guests, and have a good time. I don’t want it to be the most serious thing in the world, it doesn’t work like that. My relationship with music is one of joy, of acceptance, of love for what is. Each time that I listen to music I connect deeper with the reality of what is, and that is what I want to bring into the world by embodying it through the podcast. I just want to hold space for the transformation of people, and I just want to bring truth into the world. The truth of who we all are. The truth of who we have always been. But we forget it. We build all these layers of resistance around our experience so that we can avoid feeling how it feels. We build all these layers of resistance to not experience life fully, because it sometimes can be brutal. So why am I doing this? Because I am in a quest for truth, and breathwork is something that brings me towards it. That helps me be in service of the truth of people, of the truth of who they are. That truth that is hidden behind who they should be. That truth that is hidden behind all the stories that have brought them into what is happening right here, right now. You are the consequences of those stories, you are not those stories.

That is the thing. You are not those stories. You are way beyond. You are how those stories bend reality into something that is manifested as ‘you’. You are what is present right now, and the breath is the anchor towards this moments. It is what brings everything that you have been into the experience of who you are right here, right now. It is the remembering. It is the catalyzer for that remembering to happen. It is the means by which we can remember. The breath is the information that was missing in this quest of remembering, and it has always been with us. That is the cosmic joke. The most absurd thing of them all. The only way in is through, and the way by which you go through is with the breath. You can only explore what is present by being present, and the breath is the means by which you become more and more present. By which you explore what is here and now. And always come back to it. It will always be with you, as long as there is life there is breath. It is what anchors consciousness to your body, and it is the eternal tool of life. Now I wonder: Which is the moment in our development as a species on which we started breathing? What happened that we started breathing? When was the first breath? How did it end up happening? Is there even an explanation for it? I can’t even wrap my mind around this thing… It is so mysterious. So absolutely incredible. Do I even need to wrap my mind around it? What is the purpose of that endeavor? What do I bring out of it? I don’t even know. But yest, the breath has always been with me, and it will always be until I cease to exist in this form as a human being. I guess that that is why I’m so attached to the idea of learning how to die before I die. I love so much this experience as a human being that I want to learn how to give it up so that I can integrate that love and certain fear of death into something that can enable me to enjoy it more and more. I just want to enjoy life, and that is why the breath is present in me also. I just want to enjoy life, and the fact that I am here right now Doing The Work is because I want to become more of myself. I’m being more of myself as I write. Is that true? Or are these circles that I’m running around a manifestation of something that I’m not. Is it that I’m not this?

This is what happens when you have all the time in the world to do this kind of exploration. This is a consequence of that. When you have enough time, you end uo pondering the nature of reality more and more deeply, so that you can reach some kind of understanding about what this whole thing. But there goes the irony, the contradiction, because what this thing is cannot be understood from the mind. There is no aspect of mind that can comprehend what this whole thing is because it is beyond the mind. It is not beyond, it is not close. It is closer than close. And there is an existential need for me to know this truth, an a certain heartbreak because of not being able to. The more I try the further I go of it, because in the trying I become lost. The more I want it the more far it goes, because it is just in that exploration of trying to find something that I become lost. And now the sleepiness is kicking in again, and I wonder if it is because I’m not getting enough sleep or it is because there is something being manifested inside me that comes from deeper than deep, and the expression of that in my system is sleepiness. I don’t really know, but that’s what I can report. A very intense sensation of sleepiness. And perhaps it is related to the fact that I have been writing all this time, and writing is a very demanding process. Of attention, of concentration, of creativity. Everything that I am comes into being through my writing, and because of that I need to be aware of how it shows up so that I can set up healthy boundaries that will enable me to thrive.

Am I thriving? I keep thinking that the amount of words that I write is more important than the quality of them, and that is something that has been present in me always. The quality is determined by the quantity. What a nonsense. Especially nowadays, when people have less and less time for going through stuff. How can I pretend that someone will read a section of this book if I’m just writing and writing without polishing any of it? Is this a good creative process? What does even a good creative process mean? I don’t really know. I’m just exploring how it shows up in my experience right now, so that then I can talk from there. That is how I realizer my stuff, through my own experience. People can talk to me whatever they want and in whatever terms they feel like, but one thing is me listening to it and another thing is being able to experience it. And I want to experience it, because through that I’ll be able to speak from there.

I’m in this breathwork journey not because someone told me that it was going to be transforming, I’m here because I have been transformed with the power of breathwork and it is time for me to help other people to be transformed. That is the game. That is what I’m bringing about here, with this thing. I’m just exploring, just being, just manifesting, so that from there something will happen. And that’s the thing, probably I’m hiding behind all of these words. I just write, and write, and write, and in that process I hide behind it because I don’t give myself the time to be exposed. All this writing ends up being the means by which I hide myself because I’m making it so inaccessible that I keep people away from it because of all the noise that is here. Speech and words are one of the most powerful weapons in the world, in my world, and if I’m bombarding you with more and more of them it may be easier for you to get away from it. It may be easier for you to dodge 10k bullets through at you with brute force than 80 with the deepest intention of creating a transformation. And that’s why I’m hiding, because I had the idea of writing about why I am here and I end up writing all these words without even being able to express myself in a good way. If you had read everything that I have written here until now, would you be able to tell me why I am here? What is the purpose of what I am doing? I don’t know. I really don’t know. And it is ok like that. It is part of the game. It is part of what I’m doing by writing to understand what I bring into the world, and how I present myself in it. It this my truth? Is this the means by which I will communicate with you, dear reader?

One thing that I love the world of today is the fact that we don’t need permission anymore. Each person can be whatever she decides, just by sharing herself as that. In that sense, nowadays it is more valid than ever the fact that you become what you do through just doing it. I become a writer just by writing, more and more. I don’t need anyone to tell me what to write about. I don’t need anyone to give me guidelines to consider myself a writer. I just write. And because of that, I am a writer. The fact that I can be good or bad is just a consequence, a matter of fact, an interpretation, but nothing more than that.

Just going through this exploration has brought me deeper into the sincerity of why I am doing what I’m doing. And it is just that I don’t know. It is not something that I know. It doesn’t come from the place where knowledge comes from. It comes from the place of feeling it, of realizing that this is the next step in the staircase towards somewhere that I don’t really know. The more I’m able to share myself with the people that I will interact with, the more I will become whatever I had to become in this process. The more I’m able to be present with the people that I’ll work with, the more I’ll help them. The more I’m willing the express them my caring and love, the better they will feel. It is a continuous process, one that doesn’t end after the session. It keeps going. And maybe that is why the project is like that, because it will be a constant evolution. The evolutionary playground. Maybe that is a better way of describing the podcast, because I discover who I am by interacting with people like you. I discover who I am by being present with people like you, no matter which is your life story. I don’t care who you have been, the stories that you represent, the people that you feel identified with. I don’t care about the flags, the labels, or the measurements of success that you have used. I just want to connect with the stories that build up the human being that is in front of me, and that’s why it is important for me to build the story around this podcast as something that will enable more and more of our truth to come forth. That is the thing. Which is the story around the podcast? How am I going to frame it so that it can appeal to people? Who is the one that is going to interview?

What comes back is that story that I wanted to build around myself, about a humanoid being that comes to the earth to be the witness of what is going on here. What if that alien is just a being that is sharing its story down here? What if all the story that I want to build is representative of the story of that alien being the witness of the awakening of humanity? That is what brings life to me right now, as that story comes forth. There is a technique that comes from the world on which I inhabit, and that technique was forgotten long ago because there is no more air in there. I came here to rescue you, and that rescue will happen through the breath. I’m here to teach you how to breathe, so that you can truly understand how valuable it is to be able to breathe. Each time that you want. Each moment. You’ve just got to do it. Why do I want to frame my curiosity in the worldview of the human that I have been? Why don’t I frame it in the worldview of this alien that has been playing around my mind all this time? How would it feel like? How would it look like to be able to embody this alien through all of my actions? What if I created a story around him, one story that is built through each of those interactions? He becomes more and more of who he is by interacting with people like me. I love creating the idea that it is necessary to bring on more and more stories, more and more art, more and more techniques for doing stuff, but what if the only thing that is needed is to just built one character, one adventurer, that is the first one that comes to this place? What if I start building a parallel reality on the internet and this alien is the first being in here that came to witness the awakening of humanity? What is the gift that he brings into this place?

I don’t really know, but it definitely resonates a lot with me. The one that came, the one that is here, the one that is exploring human consciousness by lifting the fog of all of who we are not. That is what the breath does, it tells us who we truly are. And what we truly are is just presence, is just what is left when there is no more stories. Where there just is existence. This humanoid being is the means by which those stories are integrated into the void of everything that has ever been. I just am, and in that exploration I can rest. In that being-ness I can rest. I can just be. And it is time for me to create this spaceship, the one that will bring forth more and more of this beingness. The one that will enable me to thrive. To just be. I just want to be. I just want to experience everything that I am through being-ness. I just want to create crazy stuff. And I need a place where to do that. I need to build that place, and it is time for me to do that. I haven’t been able to do it yet because of all the noise, but it is time for me to do it. It is time for me to focus my energy, and this whole book is the magnifying glass that I’m using to understand how to do that. Today I was meditating in the morning and I just came up with the realization that my whole being is full of ideas. One after the next one, they never stop. I jump from one to the other one, full of aliveness, full of willingness to build stuff. And that is the thing, the important thing. What I’m focused on right now is creating this book. And exploring what comes after that. But the most important aspect of what I’m doing right now is creating this book, building it into life as the exploration into what remains after I do that. This is the work of my lifetime, what is happening here, right now, in this moment. And it will be true for everything that I decide to do in the future. It will all be the work of my lifetime. Everything that I put my mind on is the work of my lifetime. I’m a machine of building projects, of creating stuff, and the world put me in this place so that I can explore what happens when I do that. I’m here to create, to use every second that I am alive to become more and more of myself through my creations. And it is not something that will end one day. The day it ends I will be dead. No. It doesn’t end. What happens with it is that it continually evolves, since every moment is an exploration into who and what I am in that particular moment. But the answer to that is always changing, so I’m just here, evolving, being who I am by sharing with you these words.

Do they make sense?

It doesn’t really matter. It is not that they should or shouldn’t make sense. That’s not the point. The point is that they are, and that is all that matters. This is the truth being expressed through my own experience, and that is the valuable aspect of what is being done here. Nothing else matters, really. I hope that through this creative act I’m bringing a little bit more of awareness into you related to how important it is to be the witness of your own creative act. That is all that matters, truly. The fact that you are open, and ready, and willing, to show up and Do The Work. Trust in what you are doing, the pieces will fit in the future. But I already started, I’m already in, so why don’t give it my best? Why don’t put everything that I am into what is being manifested in here? Why not just play?

It is not that I need to learn how to write. Or to practice. I’m just doing it, and that is all that matters. The consequences of it are what is happening right here, right now, on my own experience as a human being. Nothing else exists in this moment, more than the music that is being played and the words that are being written. I become more of who I am by dissolving who I have always been into the words that are being written. I am through these words. I see the reflection of myself on the side of the screen, I smile, and I start dancing. What a crazy journey this one has been. What a crazy adventure. Just here to create. Just here to manifest. Just here to inspire. I’m here to inspire you, did you know? Do you realize that you are being manifested through each one of your actions, and the power of the creative act is that it is the means by which you can erase yourself from the action and become it? That is the power of the creative act, and that is why I invite you to bring more of it into your life. It will open you the doors of your future, just so that you know. The future belongs to those who have perfected the craft of dissolving themselves into the creative act.

Do you want the future to belong to you? It is time to create. It is time to merge all your life experience into something original that did not exist before. Share it with the world. Share yourself. Open up that door, and allow you to be transformed by what happens at the other side. It is crazy because most of the people in the world work for companies, and that means that all their creative work is hidden behind the safeguard of the company. I do this work for them, I’m hidden behind them, and that makes me feel safe. That is the thing. All this safety in the world of today. All this need for being safe, for not exposing themselves, their ideas, their willingness to be different. What comes at the other side of sharing yourself? That is why a big part of this book has spoken as social media as a spiritual practice. I had forgotten that, but it is very important. It is a spiritual practice, because in the moment on which you allow yourself to share who you are through an act of creation you just open up a door for a deeper understanding of which is your truth. What is your truth today? How does it express itself? That is the question that needs to be asked, and I’m here to ask it to you. Who are you when you allow yourself to be transformed by the power of expressing your own, unique truth? Where do you end? Do you really end? Is there an end? I don’t think so. Because you transform yourself into what you are bringing into the world, and what you are bringing into the world is just a manifestation that came to life. You bring something to life that was not there before. And you become the creator of the world in which we live in. If you hide that act of creation behind a label, behind a brand, you take away power from it. Do you really want to avoid giving power to your own and unique voice? Do you really want to give up all that power that you could build by just being true to what you truly want to bring? What is the truth of what you want to bring? How are you avoiding yourself by not allowing you to share everything that you are?

And that’s where I’m coming from, from a place of full transparence. I know that the future will be transparent, and everything that we do will be public. It will be in the domain of the collective, because it already is, we just don’t realize it yet. It is not something that we accept as real because we are so merged with the physical realm that we think that that is the only reality that exists, but what happens when we realize that life has always been watching? And there is no judgment, because there is no a right or wrong way of being as you play this game. Awareness just is aware, so there is no way on which it can judge itself and say: this is wrong. That doesn’t belong to the realm of awareness, it belongs to the realm of polarities. So at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if you share yourself or not. I you don’t feel like doing it, you don’t feel comfortable with it, it’s ok. Love it as it is. What I’m just trying to tell you here is that there is an enormous opportunity for self development in the act of sharing your truth, whatever it may be. And that development doesn’t only come in your own experience, it will end up impacting everyone that you come across with. It is part of the game. All your world will be impacted by it in means that are not imaginable. You can’t imagine it, you just can experience it by opening yourself to be the witness of the consequences of it. You just can experience. You can’t predict. You can know what will happen. You can just be there for when it happens.

And the invitation that I’m leaving here is to be present when that happens. When life unfolds in front of you. When everything turns up to be real, just be there. One moment after the next one. It may seem to be hard to be always present, to be always caring about being present, efforting for that, but it is actually the other way around. The more present you are, the less energy you spend in the conditioned patterns of who you believe you are. All those mental models and stories that are inside you are means by which you spend energy in something that is not your direct experience, so the more you are able to be present with what is, the less you will spend this energy with what is not. And with that, you will become more and more free. You will have more and more energy readily available for you to just enjoy life, to express yourself through life. That is what life ultimately wants, to be expressed through each and every one of us, no matter which is the life story, no matter which is the limitations that have been built in your experience. At the end of the day, they are all stories that are present in your system, and you have within the power of dissolving those stories into your experience of the present moment. You’ve just got to Do The Work. That’s what we are here for.

And speaking about Doing The Work, I rationally know that an important part of it is doing some sports so that I can push my heartrate to the sky, and spend some of that energy that is running around in my body without a clear guidance to how to spend it, so I just went through a small workout that has me relating to my body in a different way right now. The sensations that are present are those of a rush in the way I breathe, and also a feeling of being lightheaded. I can sense a bit more of clarity in my breath also, as if was bringing in more oxygen than normally. That is quite an interesting fact, and I know that this is something that I will bring more and more into my routine as the way of decompressing inside the writing session. Bringing clarity by shaking up the body completely feels like a good way to go. So now I can go back to the question that has me running around like a dog behind its tail in this session: Why am I here? What has me going through this training to become a breathwork facilitator?

The need to bring the atomic bomb into the self structure. That is something that I envision a lot being needed in this moment of humanity. Experiences that shatter the view that we have of reality, so that we can see with more clarity what our life experience has been and integrate it because of that. As I said previously, I would love to bring 5 grams of mushrooms to the dining room of each person in the world, but that, right now, is illegal. I just can’t do it. So what can I do? Just explore what comes from bringing these atomic bombs with the resources that we have at hand. And as I said, the breath is always there. We have breathing always. There is a big sense of fascination for this fact, of awe, that comes from the understanding that something so simple can have such a deep effect. That is the thing. It is so simple, but at the same time so complex. There is so much going on in there. It is just that we need to learn how to relate to our body in a completely different way. Speaking of which…

Yesterday in the afternoon I was going through the process of feeding my young daughter, and I realized how voracious she is while she is eating. She hasn’t finished eating a piece of carrot and she is reaching for the next one, as if the world was going to end. There is nothing that has taught me more about my relationship with food that being the witness of this. She is just a mirror of what I do as a father, of what her mother does, and in this act I could clearly see my reflection in her. I realized absolutely that I have a deep situation with food that has not been resolved, and it is time for me to acknowledge that so that I can put my awareness in it and make it conscious. I go through all these processes of teaching the world how to eat healthy and stuff and I’m not able to realize that the way on which I eat is the less healthy of them all. I’m always standing, picking this and that and putting it into my mouth, chewing as I’m moving around, etc. There is something very different from what I would like it to be, and there is a huge opportunity there for improvement. I care so much about the food that I eat that I forget about the most important part of it: How I do it. Which is my relationship with the process of eating? How has that relationship been through my life? I can sense that each time that I go to my parents house there is a need to go to the kitchen to explore what is there. What is it that I am avoiding in my life that I have this kinds of attitudes? What is it that I’m not being able to see? These are very important explorations that need to take place, and I have known it since a long time now. My daughter is always filling her hand with food when her mouth is full because it is what I have taught her to do. It is the only thing that she sees from me. She sees me having that relationship with food because it is all of what she has known. That is how I relate to it. That is what I bring to her. Actions speak much louder than words. And I have to say… It was brutal to see that yesterday. It was incredible to be the witness of it, to realize that a big part of what I am bringing to herself is beyond my control, because it is part of how I relate to life unconsciously. Which is the relationship that I have with food? How can that relationship be used in a way that makes me feel better? These are things that I need to explore, so that I can develop a healthier relationship with the whole process of eating. It is absolutely broken. It needs to be fixed. A new way needs to arise from the ashes. And that’s the process that I’m going through right now, the one of exploring what that new relationship will be. I need to build a new relationship, and only through that I will be able to become free from the burden of teaching my little daughter something that I’m not proud of. And I want to be proud of it. I want to be the example for her. But right now, it is very hard for me. I just don’t know how to do it. I have gone round and round and round with the thing and there doesn’t seem to be an explanation for it. What is making a lot of noise inside me these days is to bring a keto diet in, start eating way more meat, and explore how it feels from there. But it doesn’t seem to be the best move to do it right now, because we are going to Santiago and the availability of meat there is different than here. Here, we have all the meat and all the stuff more fresh. At least it feels like that. I have been playing this game for a long time, trying to bring inside myself a kind of predictability related to the way on which I feed myself that has not been there yet, and the fact that I have translated that into my daughter, and that I can witness it as clear as I can, speaks everything. It was very important to see that yesterday, and I’m sure that I will grow from there. It feels like a good new years resolution, to heal my relationship with food. It is one of the most important aspects of our whole relationship to our body, and I have not been able to do it properly yet. But I will, and it will be amazing. It is time for that. It is time to be the example for my girl that I want to be. And also for my wife. They are a consequence of who I am.

And it is also important to tell myself that it is ok as it is. This is who I am right now. I am these eating disorders. They are part of me. They are part of my experience of reality, right here, right now, and it is time for me to embrace them fully. Just through that I will be able to become free of everything that I should be.

And what comes now as information is the fact that by allowing randomness to be the means by which everything is chosen in the podcast I eliminate my own particular voice from it. I become a witness more than the creator of it, and it doesn’t feel good, at least right now. There are moments in my life on which I have felt that an important aspect of who I am is the role of the curator. Of being the one that is in charge of bringing in what is perfect for that moment. And if I leave that to randomness, I forget about that voice that I have. Right now I’m listening to the music of an amazing DJ, and I would love to have an intentional conversation with him related to music, and the role that it has played in his life. What is the problem with me embodying the importance of music in my life? Why is it that I want to avoid it so much? Why is it that I keep running away from my own and particular and unique voice? I run from it by writing 20 pages today full of something that could be seen as noise. I run from it by allowing randomness to be the means by which I choose the people that will be part of the podcast. I run from it by allowing my demons to shine through. Nope. It doesn’t work like that. You know how it works? By being intentional. By really expressing my love for music, and everything that it means in my life. By expressing the power of it, by being the witness of the impact that it has had in the life of others. By listening through the ears of others. That is the game that I need to learn how to play, and only through that game, I will be able to become more and more of myself.

Music is deeply embedded in the source of my soul, and it has been showing itself through generations and generations of people that are part of my family. I am through them. My great-grandfather and my father are being through me, and I’m exploring who I am through that. This is the craft that is being manifested in each of the actions that I undertake, and it is time for me to be able to embody all of that and bring it into life. It was the dream of my grandfather to have a place like this, and it is my mission to bring it into reality. What else could I do? What else could be more important than having a direct schedule to bring to life? That is what I need to do. That is the clarity that I’m building with the breathwork.

Why am I doing this? Because I need the clarity. My whole being explodes in different ideas, and because of the lack of need of being generating money there is a noise inside myself that tells me that I can explore them all. That they can all be part of what I do, in each moment. And I want to become free from that, by just allowing myself to be part of what is. Right here, right now. That is the only thing that matters. That is the game that I’m playing. The one that is built upon the willingness to create the coolest shit that the world has seen, and that is an eternal music festival in the metaverse. I will be the one that builds it. And that eternal festival will be a temple, a temple for beauty, for the manifestation of beauty just for the sake of it. That is what I have not been able to see until now. That is what has been hiding. And it doesn’t need to be like that anymore. From the ground up, slowly but steadily, I will build this whole thing into reality. The only thing that I need is to just do it. To bring on the samurais and bring them into existence. To create with them. To join forces with those that will be walking next to me, and just create. Just build. Just manifest. The world of the future doesn’t speak the language of money. It speaks the language of intention. Why are you doing what you are doing? How is that why expressed into each one of your actions? That is the game that needs to be played. The one of knowing what you do from a place that is closer to you than close. The one of realizing that the magic happens when you relate to life from that place of truth. From that place of truth. Which is that place of truth? The one that you will enter when you breathe with me. I keep pushing my work down, as if it was not important, as it is something that is not helpful for the one that is at the other side. When is the moment on which I get rid of this and I embody my potential by just fully trusting in what I do? How can I become more and more of who I am? By trusting in myself. By being myself. And how can I be myself if I don’t trust enough my work, and I decide who will be in there randomly? Which is the intention behind that? Nope, I don’t want it to be like that. I want to fully embody my potential by trusting in it. By being it. And the only way on which I will be able to be it is by relating more and more to the truth that is behind the power of my words. The power of my cold connections. That is something that has show over and over in my relationships with other people. I am that guy that can approach you with the pure intention of getting to know more about your work just because it was amazing. The one that truly dove into your work and enjoyed is as much as he could. As much as it was possible right there, in that moment.

I remember all those stories of approaching those DJs and telling them that their work was amazing and asking whatever question was on the top of my mind. That is something that always has stuck with me, because it is who I am. I am that randomness, that willingness to be certain to my truth, just by expressing it without problem. I love doing that, and that is something that I want to bring into the world. That is what is in front of me right now.

Why breathwork? Because it is just the next step. That is how I work. That is what I bring into my life. Steps over steps over steps. I am a climber making his way through the wall of life, always finding new places where to place my hands. I’m here, looking for that new place where I can feel comfortable. It feels safe to say that I’m lost, but I’m not. It feels vulnerable to say that I’m lost, but I’m not. I’m here to do the work, to be responsible with the craft and art of helping other people travel the depths of their consciousness. I’m here to dissolve myself into the art of being there for other people to work their shit through. I’m here to explore better who I am through the eyes of other people. I’m here to explore what I bring into the world by just bringing it. Not by being vulnerable and telling the world that I’m not ready yet. That doesn’t make sense. What makes sense is just bringing my truth, my own truth, and living from there. What makes sense is to just be myself, with everything that I’ve got, so that I can evolve my relationship with life from there. What makes sense is to explore who I have always been, with the eyes of a technique that I trust.

We live in a moment of our evolution of human beings where we need atomic bombs to navigate the depths of who we are, and I’m here to evolve myself through the relationship with the most obvious of them all: the breath. The only way in is through, and it is through the breath that we will realize everything that we are. Everything that we have always been. And the future we can create so that we can embody our whole potential.

I’m here because I trust. And that’s all that matters.
