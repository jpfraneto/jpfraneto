What is the aspect of ourselves that prevents us from sitting down and Doing The Work? How can the balance be reached? Which is the point on which the patterns of behavior that bring me away from it are made conscious so that they can be changed? Which is the difference between excuses and stuff that is necessary to go through to actually evolve?

Right now I have the willingness to write kind of blaming myself for going into pattenrs of action that I know are not good for me, but I keep doing them, blaming others. Or using them as an excuse to do what I do. I smoke weed so that I can have a good time with my wife and her friend. Is that truly necessary? Is anyone forcing me to do it? But I keep going into that, falling into that victim mentality of thinking that there is someone forcing me to do stuff. And no one is doing that, I am the own master of my own life, I am the one that needs to take it into account, and I have to start putting on the pants so that I can become self-sovereign.

I ate all that sugar to feel how I feel, to be the witness of what it brings to my experience, and it is ok like that. Now I am witnessing, and what it brings are these feelings of not being good enough, which are always present as a way of blaming myself. And I know that I am not this feelings, and if that I want to truly know myself and know who I am there needs to be a recognition about this, about the aspects of myself that make me feel in a particular way, and actually about the aspects of myself that feel the way they feel. And also showing up now to write is a major information source, because of how I feel as I write.

The other days when I have came to write there has been like a sense of freedom, of flow, which is not present in this moment. If I had to describe how I feel now, there is something kind of sluggish present. Like a mass of starch with water that is trying to move towards somewhere and doesn’t truly know how to move, how to make that progress.

What comes is that difference between expectation (‘where I should be’) and the acknowledgment of where I am at, that always induces in me this sense of anxiety of wanting to be in another place. That is always part of my experience, and as I move towards a dissolving of this expectation I realize that I’m making some kind of progress, in this line of action that there is no progress really because everything happens at the same time. Everything is perfect as it is right now. It has always been. It is only in me to be able to witness that from the perspective of truth, of realizing that actually it is that way. What a crazy thing. That every master throughout history (or the story) has known this as the biggest truth of them all, and how hard it is to actually experience life from that standpoint.

This existence is like the eternal story. The never ending story. Life is a never ending story. Going round and round in this cycle of shifting emotions, circumstances, people and energy. Nothing that I write truly makes sense, and there is a big aspect of myself that is judging this moment as a waste of time. As if there was something more important to be done in this moment. Being with my daughter, with my partner. But where are the limits. I also need to make progress in this exploration of what the writing will bring. When do I give myself to put down into the paper my thoughts and emotions so that I can afterwards come for them and realize how I was feeling this Sunday morning listening to the birds outside, food hangovered and feeling bad because it is too late for me to being doing this, I should have woke up earlier so that I could do all my stuff before the girls waking up so that I could feel amazing today, with my heart full of joy of having put inside a new day of bringing into the world what I want to bring.

What is it that I want to bring? That is the best question to ask. Because it has evolved so much throughout my experience as a human being, going from one place to another one, experimenting life and its different aspects like a pendulum, which goes from one extreme to the next one. I’m not able to bring balance into my life, because I always oscilate between extremes. How can this be resolved? How can I reconcile these extremes and integrate them into a balanced experienced of what it means to be alive for me?

How can I summarize what I want to bring to the world? Nothing special. Just myself. Just my translation of the life force that is moving through me, so that I can create from there. I failed. But to who I failed? Is it just inside me? Do other people see me as a failure? I don’t think so. Yesterday I spent a long time talking to and old friend, and it was an amazing talk. Do I think that he sees me as a failure? I don’t think so. We enjoyed it. No one is going to come and get me by the hand and tell me hey, you are not a failure. Nope, not at all. No one is going to do that. It is my duty to be in charge of that. I am the one that needs to show up for myself, and start sharing everything of what I am so that I can bring more of that.

What do I want to bring into the world?

More of what I am. More of every piece, every moment of what I am. And in this moment, I am a constant blaming of not having done things ‘as they should have been done’. I am writing a book that is called ‘The End Of Shoulds’, and here I am, shouldding myself. How original this is. How fun it must be to witness the intricacies of this crazy mind running around in circles, trying to catch its tail. Running round and round and round, feeling what it feels to be alive through the words that come. Through the blaming. You shouldn’t have done that. But I did it with an intention. I ate all that yesterday with the intention to share with my girls. I ate all those cereals in the morning with the intention of feeling how it felt in my body. I ate breakfast with the girls with the intention of sharing that space with them. When is the moment on which I acknowledge that intention, and start accepting it as an integral part of my reality in this moment?

I did it with intention, and now that intention is forgotten. What if I go back into the consequences of what my intention had in the world?

It was amazing to deepen my relationship with my wife and her friend yesterday. Smoking that joint helped me feel how it feels to not have tension inside the brain. It was a relief of that tension. I know that I have to work my way through it on my own, but what if I need a little bit of help? When there is an aspect of myself that feels that there needs to be a breakthrough soon, if not the world is doomed, it is that part of me that feels that things should be different than what they are. And that is the part that I’m recognizing as the one that I’m not, so this what I’m writing about here is actually the information that I need to make some progress. I feel bad after having done something with intention because that which I did is not aligned with what I should do. I should not eat in the night. I should wake up early and write so that I’m ready early in the morning. I should do this. I should do that. The book should be called the eternal shoulds. Yes. That makes a little bit more of sense. Should here, should there. All running around from one should to the other one. What if I brought shoulds into the normal world, into the day to day world? Maybe that is my mission here, to be able to should from the morning to the night, bridging the gap from what should be to what is. That is the gap that I’m bridging every day. The one from what should be to the one that is.

I wrote the other day about bringing the teachings to the normal random person, and perharps that is my mission here. How can I bring the end of shoulds into a normal person? Probably by embodying it. If I think about how to do it, it is a process that comes from the mind, from wanting to know. The mind wants to know, the body wants to feel comfort. That is what my mind is trying to do. To know the answer. What should be done in order to bridge that gap. That is the mind doing its thing. And this game is played in another realm. The one of just doing. Of meeting people, and opening up the space for a transformation to happen. The end of shoulds starts from a place that is different from the mind. From an interface that is different. I’m doing my thing from that place also, it is the one that is the most comfortable for me. How to get out from there and just start to enjoy life? That is the mission that comes. That is the space that I need to start holding. For people to open up. Not the biggest entrepreneurs of the world, not the most important people of them all, but just the normal and random dudes that go from a to b in a way that is automatic, because life does not have anything better from them. Those are the ones that I need to talk to, to bridge this gap, to better understand my role in this whole thing. Maybe more than understand it, just to live it in a way that is nice.

Gente del sur. That is the podcast that I should start. Really, I should have 6 different podcasts, one for each day of the week. Gente del sur, Timeless Integration, Into Tech, Towards the Metaverse, The New Medicine, The New Religion. Those are all topics that I am very interested about, and I should have a podcast in each one of them so that I can grow through having conversations with people from all over the world around those topics. Yes, this is a new aspect of myself running around in circles, battling against my own mind as I find ways of relating in a different way to what I want to bring into the world. A radio. That is what I have always wanted to bring into the world. A radio. One that is present in every city, in every small city in every part of the world, and which is able to bring into the people of that part joy. That is the mission of the radio, to shine a light into the amazing individuals of that particular place, and help them live a life that is fulfilling. Maybe that is my life’s mission. To create a radio. That is what my family has been pushing me towards, with my granparents listning to a lot of music, and my grandfather having a music store. How would my life look like if I had a radio? What do you do for a living? I have a radio. And I create the programming of it, so that people can enjoy it in every moment. What is the name of the radio? It is not clear now. But it is the dream of the eternal festival. Music being played 24/7, with the clear intention of shining a light into the particular aspects that every human being brings into life. Yes. A radio brings a lot of what I care about together. The joy of life. The joy of what every human being is. Historically there has been a local radio in each part of the world, and through this, we can be able to travel back in time and join the technology of the old world with the one of the new one.

How does a modern radio look like? How do you tune into it? Is it an app? The Human Music App. That is something that a lot of people have asked me for. Make it an app. That is your mission, to make it as an app. And people can go in and do their thing. Listen and give their time to listen to what is going on in there, without recordings, only with what is present. You can’t go back, you can just witness what is present. How many channels would a radio that has one channel for every municipality in the world have? That is the smallest unit of connection between human beings IRL, the municipalities. That is how they come together and organize themselves. How does a new municipality look like? What if Puerto Varas was the first one in the world that implemented its own token? That is something important that I listened yesterday in that web3 talk, how DAO’s can be the means by which IRL businesses come together to do similar things. The interesting about the world how it works now is that there is X amount of small businesses that work in a particular way throughout the world. What if just one of them, in each place of the world, transformed the way on which it did its thing so that people could come to do something different? My heart always comes back to what I have been designing this whole time, the infinite jest, human music. The downtown cinema. David Foster Wallace is always there, in the background, calling me from its place wherever he is. He is calling my attention and letting me know: The only book that you need to read is The Infinite Jest. That is the one that you have to study, over and over again. The answers to depression are in there. You can jump from one to the next one all your life, but the important thing that you need to know is in only that book. Each book points toward the same thing. Know yourself. Know who you are, and from there, act into the world with that knowing. With that truth. I can spend my whole life gathering inspiration from other books, but the biggest inspiration of them all that I can get is by having conversations with people from different parts. What am I interested in? Science, spirit, health, music, normal people, web3, software engineering. These are all topics that I care about, and by bringing in people to talk about them I can make progress in it. The thing is that I can have a never ending list of things that I care about, but the integral one of them all is that I care about human nature. That is the common ground of them all. Human Nature. What if I call it human nature? The Human Nature Podcast. One episode in English, one in Spanish. I can run around with that show every day, to the rest of my life. And how could I do something more important than exploring life from the eyes of a different person, each day, forever and ever? Give myself time to explore that person and realize how amazing it is to be alive from that exploration.

Perharps that is what I have to do. Enjoy life by seeing myself in the eyes of another person. Yes. That sounds like a good thing to do. And use music as the means of that exploration. The album that they will bring to the other side is the best way on which I can do that. Explore it. If you died tomorrow, what album would you bring to the other side? Yes. Without the fluff of wanting to put inside their mouth religion, science, or whatever. Just with the willingness to explore who they are by interacting with them from the heart. That is all what is needed. Lex Fridman publishes an episode almost every three days. Is there someone that listens to all of them? Probably not. The important thing is not that. The important thing is that they happen. That they exist. That is all that matters. Because in that exploration is the magic. In the exploration of what it means to be alive. Maybe the only person that will listen to the podcast will be the mother of my guest. It doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is how much I will learn by interacting with that person. I am a chameleon, and I can go into the story of whatever person I want, with all of who I am. I can bring them in, and have a joyful conversation with them. That is the exploration. That is what my heart tells me to bring into the world. It is not that pure complexity of trying to go into the depth of life by going deep and deep. Seeking and seeking. It is about realizing that I am every one of these human beings, and in that exploration, I become alive. I discover who I am by interacting with people like you. That is the magic. To just open myself to that discovery, by opening myself to have those conversations. Open myself to share what I am with the world, and learn from there. Things will happen. Things will come to being. The only thing that matters is that is happens. Through me. Through my willingness to explore. To discover. To face the void.

I came here and wrote about things not being the way they should be, because I did not do them properly. The trap inside any routine that you can force yourself into is that you can start identifying with it. ‘I can only be creative if I do it in the morning after having fasted for 15 hours’. That is a container for creativity, but the best can come when you least expect it. Transform your relationship with yourself, so that you can live 24/7 in presence, being a permanent channel for life force to come into the material world through you. Every aspect of yourself is that creative force, not only the one that is present before the sun comes up.

That is the consequence of having showed up today to write this. I started with a feeling of this moment not being a good one, because I was not in the best mood, but what came up is perfect as it is. It is the information that needed to come. That is the game that we need to learn how to play, each one of us. Create the boundaries for that to happen in your own life. You don’t need to block 7 hours. You just need a small space so that you can tap into yourself and create from there. The spark of light is waiting for you to ignite it, and the aspect of yourself that thinks than that can only happen in a particular moment of the day is your ego. Become free of that.
