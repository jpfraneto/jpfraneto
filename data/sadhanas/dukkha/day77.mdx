What is present in me this day is related to the role of rituals in my life. What do they mean? I like the concept of rituals, what they mean. I have even tried to bring it to the way on which I work, to ritualize the deep work sessions. But I can’t say that I have succeeded. I end up falling back into the trap of doing things in a hurry, without truly embodying what I’m doing, or why. I guess that is a big theme related to rituals, and why I want them present in my life: The reason behind them. I wanted to ritualize the deep work sessions so that I could bring my whole being into each one of them. More than having something predictable that I could look forward to every day as I sat down to Do The Work, what I wanted to bring is a deeper embodiment of all the aspects on my self into the work that I do. It is, in many ways, to give up the rational aspects of myself and open up to the deeper ones. To the ones that are hidden to plain sight. I want to ritualize my actions so that I can be truly present in each one of them. So that from there my truth can arise.

This comes up as I’m posed with the question: What does marriage mean to me? Why to go through a ritual after which I’m going to have a ‘different kind’ of bonding with the woman that I decided to live my life? What is that ritual going to bring into my relationship with her that will make us arrive at the other side with a different way of relating to reach other? Because if not, why do it? Why do it if it is not going to change anything in our relationship? Is it to please the ones that are expecting us to do it? I don’t want to dive into a commitment like that from that place. But I do want to be transformed. Always. I’m a chameleon, and I grow when I open up the door for being transformed. And in that sense, being in this relationship with my partner is an ongoing transformation, probably the biggest of my life, because with her I open up everything that I am. Every day. And that has enormous value, and having the opportunity to call her my wife is something huge. Yes, it may be a social construct, but it is a very important one. Something that I feel inclined to do is to learn a bit more about the bond between two people that decide to live their life together in other cultures. What does it mean there? Why do they do it? I feel a little bit lost with my role as a husband, I haven’t been given too much inspiration related to this throughout my life, and I think it is an important thing to have inside as I dive into this question. To better understand what I want to bring into my family with this decision. I already told her that I wanted to marry her, but when that happened there was no clarity inside me related to this. It was just that I wanted our relationship to be consolidated in some way, but I did not have enough clarity of what it meant.

And that’s why I’m here, thinking as I write, so that I can better understand what is inside me when I bring rituals to my life. And this is not the only ritual. I sit on meditation every morning, and the way on which I do it is just sit down and start doing the thing. If there was a deeper embodiment on ‘why’ I’m doing that, I think that the whole process would be deeper. It would have another meaning. I would approach it in a different way. But until now I have not even been able to build an altar for myself. On which I could honor the masters, my ancestors, human nature and nature itself. There is not something in me that is inclined to do this. I mean, I feel somewhere that it is something that is missing, but at the same time, it is hard for me to make it happen. Transform it into a reality. Why is it so hard for me to ritualize things? What am I avoiding with that behavior? And that also plays a role in my resistance with this whole marriage thing. What am I avoiding that I don’t give myself the space to realize why I want to bring that into my life?

What is it about that ritual that builds up resistance in me? What is it about rituals at large that resonates with me but at the same time makes it hard for me to transform them into a reality by which I connect with those deeper aspects of myself as I practice them?

It is something that is bringing some information into myself that I’m not accepting yet. And I can see that that resistance has always been there. Is it as if my being hides from the ritualistic aspect of things. Always running around, moving fast so that the ritual cannot capture me. But I want to be transformed by that energy. I know that. But it’s hard, I can’t help it. And with that, I’m not able to establish this deep relationship with rituals in my life. I guess it is time to start in some way, maybe with my morning meditation. I do it for one hour and I can’t even start with something to ground myself. I do it for others, but when it comes to me, it is very hard. And now comes everything that I do, always in a rush because I have to do what’s next. I wake up in the morning to get the first glass of water and I’m not able to express gratitude for the act of being alive another day. There is always criticism in me related to something different from what is going on in that moment. What if I bring gratitude to that moment? What if gratitude is the means by which I realize better which is the role that rituals play in my life?

- “I’m grateful for being alive another day, this meditation is because of that.”
- “I’m grateful that I can come and do my work a new day. This session is for that.”
- “I’m grateful that I can have a new guest in the podcast. This episode is for that.”
- “I’m grateful that I have someone to work with, this session is with that spirit in mind”
- “I’m grateful for being alive, this moment is for that.”
- “I’m grateful for having my little girl, this play afternoon is for that.”

I get so caught into the doing that I forget to realize that I take for granted everything that I have. Everything that I’m surrounded with. And because of that, I’m not able to be the witness of what that means. Of the value that it brings to my life. I have given so much energy to being independent that I have lost the gratitude for what I have. Because I always think that it gives me less independence. I don’t need any friends, because I can be friends with the whole world. This makes me not value the friends that I have. And that makes me not ritualize every interaction that I have with them with an energy that can help me get the most out of it.

On one side, you could think that it is too much to go around life ritualizing everything, but on the other side it is the best way to live in my worldview. Because it speaks about being present. And more than that, because you are summoning the forces that are beyond, so that they can come and help you in the task at hand. In the case of the marriage, to be able to hold the hand of the wife when things are good, and especially when they are bad. I think that I give life so much for granted that I’m not able to realize how much I will lose if I don’t have next to me the people that I take for granted now. Or the things that I take for granted. That’s why it is so important to have in mind the ritualization of things in life. And I guess that the first one will be when I finish writing this book. The first major ritual, I mean. I have given all this energy all this time to this project, and it is time for me to celebrate. That’s the thing, a ritual is very connected to a celebration. And in the case of the wedding, what do we celebrate? Love. The connection between two human beings that decided to mediate their relationship with love in the middle. It is in a way giving birth to the act of building from love. With it at the middle. From that perspective onwards. I want to bild from there, and I truly want to be able to embody what it means. But it is hard, you know. I haven’t been told how to do it. But that’s with most of things in my life. I like finding my own answers, without people telling me which is the way. In that sense, I like finding my own way. That’s why I’m writing this, so that I can understand which is my perspective related to this topic. I’m writing so that I can better embody what it means to go through rituals. To practice them.

What is a ritual, anyway? That is the question that popped to mind right now. It is very redundant to say that that is the question that popped to mind, because of course it popped, that’s why I wrote it. And now I’m writing all this thing related to that question because I’m avoiding answering it. I don’t know what a ritual is. But this exploration my own answer to it. And that brings an important point to mind, because rituals mean something different to each person that participates in it. For example, in my wedding, it will be different for my partner and my father. Their perspectives and ‘whys’ will be different, and it is ok like that. It is part of it. I guess that it is going to be interesting to give the people that will participate the opportunity to get to know a little bit more of our story, of our perspective on this thing, on our why’s.

It is not about giving excuses, or pleasing people, but it is one of the most important things that I will do in my life so I better do it in a way that makes sense to me. And to her. To us. I want to live my life asking myself: With the embodiment of this action, what am I bringing to the world? Which is the intention behind doing this? And from there, decide what is it that I want to do to bring that into a reality. From there, manifest. That’s the thing. I don’t feel comfortable doing the same that other people have done. I don’t want to do it because I want to hold a certain status within a particular group of people. I’m doing because I love her, and more than that, because I’m here to discover what love is alongside. In that sense, getting married is a testament to that process of discovery. Process that will take all the lifetime, and that’ why there is so much value on having this kinds of conversations so that we can realize what does each of us care about. What is the sum of expectations that we have from our position within our community, within our groups, so that we can act from there. I know that we have been away from this, not caring enough about what is our role in relationship to others, but I think that it is something worth exploring.

And now I want to come back to the meditation or deep work as a ritual. What is the role of that in society? How do I help society by having those kind of practices ritualized? What comes is that it is a relationship with the ‘why’ of the work, again. I want to bring my whole being into what I do, so that the outcome of it can be better than what it would be if I didn’t do it. And yes, you could argue that it doesn’t matter because you could perfectly sit down and work without knowing what is going on in there. Without caring about the ritual. And perhaps you could come out with better work. But once, or twice. The point I’m making is this: What happens if it is just an act of faith? What if I open up to that faith, and realize that going into a ritual is also an act of faith. When people go to the church to get married, there is an act of faith going on in there. They trust god to be the one that will have them giving love to each other. Maybe it is not like that, and what they do is just trust themselves and god is just the witness. I mean, he always is. So it is very interesting to realize what about the witness is related to the faith that is brought into the act. What does it bring? What is the purpose of it? I don’t really know in the case of the weddings with a priest and the church in between, but I think that there is a big relationship in there with faith. And I also want to bring that into my relationship.

There have been moments on which we have had arguments and I tell her that I’m still here because of faith. Because of the faith that it will eventually work out. That we will make it. That eventually it will make sense. It will work out. I’m here, going through what I go through because I trust that love will win. Love will find its way. It will win. But until I (we) get there, there is a road that needs to be walked. I don’t think that love is something that arises spontaneously, I think that it is something that is a consequence of a long list of things, one of which is the willingness to be faithful about the reasons that have you both together. Be faithful in the role that those reasons play. So that from there an understanding can arise, one of learning how to deal with the hard situations. I will be with you in the good and bad moments. And how to deal with those bad moments? How to be there for the other person when there is something tough going on? I think that love is very much related to faith. Maybe it is because I haven’t felt love, I don’t know. There is a part of me that tells me that I have been deprived from the emotion of love, until now, and that everything that I do is mediated by the mind. And I’m extremely open with that, and I don’t have any problem to say it. I can’t say that I have felt love for my little girl, it is not something that I could describe as it. I have only felt a big willingness to take care of her, to be there for her, to be the best I can, but a physical sensation, or emotional response, that I could speak about as ‘love’ is not in my domain of experience. Yet. I’m faithful that it will, and I think that everything that I have written in this book is a testament about that. I have not been able to feel love because I’m buried inside the maze of my own mind. And here I am, running around, trying and trying but not realizing that the maze is built because of the trying. It is not by trying to feel love that you feel it. It is by giving it that you experience it. It is by opening to that frequency that it enters your domain of relationships, both with yourself an with others. And I’m waking that road you know. And maybe it is because I expect too much from myself. And from life.

Just as I was writing this it came to my mind a message that I received earlier from a friend that I’m working with, using breathwork as the tool of deeper exploration of her life experience. She said to me ‘Thank you for all the love that you give me’. So in my relationship with others there is love, they perceive it as such, and it is just me the one that is not willing to realize that. It is me the one that is closing the door to it, because I’m over rationalizing what it should be felt. Love should be felt like this. It should be expressed like that. All shoulds. The reality is that I gave love to this friend in the form of a sincere willingness for her to be in a place of more clarity, and that love is in the form of time, of passion, of holding the space for her. Those are the kind of things that I’m not able to realize in myself, and that I criticize myself too much for. When will it be the day on which I open up for the experience of love? When will it be the day on which I will walk that road? I’m sure that something will come out of that, but it is the journey that I’m in right now, dealing with the ghosts inside my mind and not with the ones that are in my heart. Love comes from the heart. From openness. From the willingness to discover, to explore, to be there for the other person. I know that that is something that I want to bring into my family, and the ritual of our commitment can be the means by which I’m able to do it. I am where I am at, and it is very important to acknowledge it. To realize the beauty of what is. I guess that rituals are very connected to that: For seeing with more clarity the beauty of what already is. In that sense, they are an anchor into the experience of the present moment. They are an invitation into what is always been hiding at plain sight. They are an invitation to allow life to manifest through me. It is about letting my ego aside, and opening to something bigger than myself. I guess that now after witnessing everything that has come up until now in this writing session, that is what rituals are for me: Opening to the numinous. Opening to something that is beyond. Opening to what is bigger to myself. Opening to what has always been here. Open to what is, so that I can better enjoy it. With everything that I am, with everything that I have.

So what is the endgame mission of what I’m doing? I think that it is to be able to have conversations with amazing individual in the world that make me connect deeper with what it means to be a human being. Right now, as I got accepted into a program on which I’ll be able to work on a product for then launching it, it is time to start deciding what I’m going to focus on in the next months. This whole writing was supposedly the manifesto of something bigger than myself. Of something that I would start building that will help me have an interface with the world with the intention of bringing my own magic to it. With the purpose of impacting in a way that only I can do. And I have been doing it, I’m working with 4 people with the breath, and I’m moving my cards there. But I need something more. I need to have the intellectual challenge that is only brought up when you are building a business, having to deal with the market, having to offer something valuable to others that can help them transform their world. That is what I want to bring into the world, and this program on which I got accepted is the means by which I will be able to manifest it into a reality. What is resonating inside me related to this is building in Spanish, so that I can tap into that big market that is not as active in the NFT world as it is in English. And Spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the world, so this can be huge. I still don’t have the technical knowledge to pull off something like this, but I know that it is something that I can bring that will have value. Isn’t it? Am I just wasting my time even thinking about that? It is just one more project that I want to create, but is it truly worth it? I think what is wanting to be manifested is something different, and it is related to the fact that I have been writing this book this whole time. There is an amazing value on the act of me sitting down to write here whatever I want to write, and in the act of the stream of consciousness there is an amazing value also. And creating something for the AI to summarize what you write into X words that can be edited in your style is incredibly valuable, so why don’t create something like that? It is much more connected to what I have been doing until now, and it is time for me to embody that. To bring it into life. 88 minutes. That’s the name. 88minutes.xyz. That is the domain name. That is the length of the DW sessions. That is what will be brought up in that program. Why would I limit myself with the DW sessions if that is what has been manifested this whole time? This is the future of creativity, and why should I start something new if I’m already working with this full power? Why should I limit myself? Why should I stop believing? It doesn’t make any sense. It is time for me to just trust me, and let me realize that the act of coming here and write for all of the time that I have been doing it speaks about something important that is being manifested through me, and I have been doing that, it is just a matter of me realizing it and being able to witness myself in that act. I have written almost 400k words, and I have put my heart and soul into each one of them. I have tried to bring my best into each session, I have tried to be as focused as I can in each session, and more than in each session, throughout my life. I’m doing the most intense internal work that I have done ever before, and it time for me to acknowledge that. Because each time that I come and I sit down to write I put every part of my internal training into it, I sweat through the words, and I want to leave all that aside so that I can just start a new project that doesn’t have anything to do with this one? Nope, it doesn’t make any sense. What I will do is continue with the thread that I have been pulling with this project, and go down the road with this one. I know it will be hard to go back and realize everything that has been written, it is too much, but I know that there is value in this, I know that everything that I am is present in these words. Without filtering. With as much clarity as I can.

These are the words of someone that has put all his heart into the dissolution of the ideas that are inside him related to who he is. These are the words of one that has put all his energy into the dissolution of the stories that are being told inside. These are the words of someone that has done the impossible to get out of the labyrinth of the mind. These are the words of someone that is absolutely clear with the fact that he has not been successful. But they are the words of someone that trusts. That knows that there is something more, beyond the limits of the perception that are present right now in his experience as a human being. These are the words of someone that won’t give up, because there is no chance for it. These are the words of someone that is deeply stuck inside the maze of Dukkha, and that knows that the only way out is by stopping time, and realizing that everything that is happening is within an invention that has been developed by evolution to help me (and you) exist until this point of our history. These are the words of someone that knows that the next stage of our evolution is when we all realize that we are a story that is being told inside a framework that is called mind. But I’m not that mind. You are neither. We are beyond it. It is just that we cannot comprehend it, because the one that tries to comprehend it is the mind. It is the embodiment of mind that you call “I”. So now is a good time to ask you: Who is that “I”?

Ask yourself that question, until no one remains. Until you dissolve into the answer, into what is beyond the answer. Into what pervades the answer, into what is in, out, within, without. Into everything that has always been, and that will ever be.

Give yourself the opportunity to manifest your truth through each and every one of your actions. I’m here to give me that gift. Each day that I come here and show up and start writing is a new opportunity that I give myself to merge the writer, what is being written, and the act of writing into an universe that contains everything. Each moment on which I sit down and allow myself to exist through the words that come out is a step that I walk towards the dissolution of that ‘I’, towards the understanding that all the separation that is built in my experience is a consequence of that ‘I’ being in place. Since the dawn of time. Since every time. But it is enough. I’m done with it. There is not more than I can do that just keep walking this road, because I can’t stand it anymore. It is getting weirder and weirder. My brain is going to explode with all the energy that is being moved inside. My body doesn’t know how to handle this. My mind is becoming crazy, and it is ok, because it wants to hold its position as the master. As the one that is in charge. It is set up in place to defend itself, to perpetuate itself, but it is time to let go. Each moment is an invitation to let go. To melt the “I” into the act of being. Into pure beingness. Life is an invitation to just be, and the fact that we are navigating these dark waters at this moment of history is because what comes at the other side of polarization is the absolute unity. We all become one. And that doesn’t mean that there is a magical merging of everything that is into one single spot, it means that we all realize ourselves into the realization that awareness is all what is. It is the ground of existence. What comes from the other side of that realization of awareness being aware of itself is pure freedom. That’s what an awakened species is about. Pure freedom, pure creative expression. What we see in the world right now is the absolute expression of wanting to control what is not controllable. Of wanting to be in charge. Of not allowing what wants to be to be. Just give it up. It is time to give up, and allow life to live through each and every one of us. Life just wants to be lived, it is just us that put ourselves in the way.
