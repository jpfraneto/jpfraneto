That necessity that I have for going into the world and filling my experience with stuff that ends up being what takes me away from my center is something that in this moment I acknowledge and because of that I make it conscious. I finished my meditation primed for coming here to write and before that I realized that it would be a good idea to tweet so I started scrolling in there (not too much, just a little bit) and then I sent a gm message to my wife and there I was reading something that another friend sent me. It could be worse, I know, but it is part of what I acknowledge because if I just came here without having gone to the internet to consume before I would be fresher, with different ideas, and not blaming myself for not doing what I SHOULD be doing. There goes the magic word again. Thank you for coming back. I guess that it is a good moment for it to appear, because right now it speaks about why it is present. In my mind, there is an expectation of something that it would be good that it happened (that I meditate and come here to write so that I can follow that stream of consciousness without interruption of external stuff), and the fact that that expectation is not met makes me feel a bit out of balance. So what in the world tells me that that expectation is something good? Because of what happened, I’m here realizing what I’m realizing, and it is perfect as it is. It is not that it should have been different, it will never be as I expect it. Never. The important part of all this game is to realize that the game is to accept reality just as it is. Just as it is. If I stared at twitter for two hours not engaging with anything and just consuming what is there, it is perfect as it is. It is part of the game. It is part of what needs to happen so that I can better realize which are the aspects of myself that I need to work towards, so that I can better embody them.

It happens with everything. My friend told me that she crossed the 1 month without alcohol mark, and that it has been brutal. I did not cross it, because for me there is not clarity on why I’m quitting it. I don’t feel comfortable with quitting really, because it gives me a space of connection with my family that is missing if this substance is not there. I have quitted for long times, but there is something that I would be missing if I quitted completely. And that is my mind playing tricks on me, playing its game of ‘ok, once in a while it is good’, and me not being able to realize if that is good or bad. There goes the shoulds again. The aspect of myself that writes that is the one that expects that there should be something happening with my relationship with alcohol, instead of what really happens. I should quit because it is what all the people that are healthy do. But there is a lot of things that I do and they don’t, and it is very important for me to realize and embody that I am a particular human being, doing his thing, with a particular lifestyle and activities and relationships and everything. It is part of the game. What I have learned the most out of this journey of self discovery is the importance of giving myself space to miss the mark of perfection. If I say that I will quit alcohol for 1 year, and I don’t do it, it is ok, I did it with intention. It was not something that I did just because I felt that I wanted to drink, I did it because I wanted to feel a deeper connection with my father. Did it really bring more connection with him? Actually not. They came to my house and it was me the one that proposed him to bring some beers, because of what I thought. But he ended up drinking a alcohol free beer, so all of my intention is in my own mind. What if I just invite him to have some tea instead of asking him to bring a beer? It would have been the same, or even better, and that is something that I learn more and more as I walk this path of learning better why I do what I do, and how I feel about it.

I was trying to find an analogy related to this whole process of becoming more conscious. Yesterday I listened to one that the person that said it said it was good, but I didn’t like it too much. He spoke about a pint of ice cream, that the first time you eat it all without even noticing. Next time you eat half of it. Next time you open it and realize that you don’t really want. And the next time you have the idea of having some ice cream and you realize that it is a thought and you look at it and it comes and goes away. And that is everything that it takes for making the unconscious conscious, to be able to realize how those thoughts come and go, and where do they come from. It is the same for me with food. Actually that thing that my friend has with alcohol, and she quitting it, I have it with food, especially sugar. Those are all regulators of the nervous system, and it is crazy to witness myself how I eat. I just open up the shelf and eat whatever I find, a handful of it, as I walk, as I move. It is very, very hard for me to sit down and eat my food. Enjoy it and taste it. It seems like every time that I eat I’m in a rush, there is something that needs to be made afterwards. And that is a killer of all the healthy habits that I could have, because of the information that I’m sending to my whole system related to one of the most important processes of my being: eating. I try to eat healthy foods, but the way on which I eat is not healthy at all. This is something that it is very important for me to take into account. My friend told me about alcohol being the means by which she suppressed a lot of emotions, and now that she is quitting it there is a lot that is coming out. It is the same for me with food, because I get to my house and I start doing stuff and I start running around and I get a handful of seeds before I take up Mila and I go and go and go and then my wife is talking to me and I’m chewing all this thing that I have inside the mouth and it is not helping me to feel good because there is that voice inside my head blaming me for being eating as I’m standing up and there is all the noise related to how I should be eating and I realize that I will not do it anymore but it is too late because I am already doing it so that’s when I say I will stop but it is almost impossible for me to stop because I do it so often that I don’t even realize, but that is the game, to start realizing it more and more often and because of that make it more conscious and develop a healthier relationship with the process of eating overall.

Make it sacred. How can I ask people to have cooking as something sacred if I don’t even do it? How can I ask myself to have it as something sacred if I don’t do it myself? It is time for me to do it. It is time. It is the perfect time. It is all about playing this game of: What am I avoiding with this behaviour? What I’m not willing to witness in myself and in the relationship that I have with my environment? Yesterday in the night I was eating as I felt a lack of love from my partner, and I thought to myself: I eat so that I can suppress what comes to me because of the lack of love that she expresses to me. What if instead of having eaten that I just had told her: I love you. And hug her? Why am I waiting for her to express love to me if that is what I am expecting?

Yes. It is time for me to truly make it sacred. To become what I can become when I’m able to realize that I’m pushing stuff down with those patterns of action that are deeply rooted in my system. As I write this, I become more free of them, and that helps me to be more of what I truly am. I am very grateful for my friend that pointed that out to me, and to realize how important it is to hold hands with each other in these processes of taking out stuff that is embedded in the way on which we experience life. As we open up to take all that, we leave space for what doesn’t normally come out to do it, and that is very helpful for our whole process of evolution as human beings.
The end of suffering is accepting that there will be moments on which things like this will happen. There will always be aspects of my day that will be different from what ‘should’ be, and the important thing there is to be able to acknowledge those and realize that they are a normal and necessary part of what it means to be alive. It is about developing a healthy relationship to all of these aspects, and that comes from being conscious about them. And what does it mean to be conscious about them? How can I tell that to a big and fat person that eats pizza all day? How can I help that person?

By helping her realize that there is an underlying aspect with that self-destructive behavior. If I drink a beer every week with my father that is not a self-destructive behavior, but if a person eats pizza every day that definitely is one, so there is an aspect of the relationship that that person has with himself that needs attention. One take on this game is that the outer part of how we are built is the physical, then comes the mental, and then comes the emotional. Think of them as layers into your being, and how the outer layers manifest is a consequence of the internal ones. So if a person has problems in her body, it is because there is an underlying emotional problem that should be tapped so that the healing could be integral. Every part of it. We need to go deep into those emotional layers so that we can heal all of them, and with that, become free. That is what the samskaras are about in the meditation process. As you meditate, you start to feel certain sensations in your system that may be associated with a particular expression of something that could have happened to you, and as you just let it be and embrace it and accept it, it dissolves and it is integrated. That is the process with which you can start developing a healthy relationship with your own life, by being able to stare at those elements that are in you and accept them, just as they are. Not as they should be, but as they are. With that, you start becoming free.

And that is why this project that I’m building requires the consistency to show up and Do The Work. Because it is just by being like that that you open up the space for these things to arise so that you can make them conscious. If you go through life as a machine without ever reflecting about what is going on, without ever making conscious what has been unconscious, you won’t be able to heal these emotional aspects of your experience. But as soon as you start walking that path, you will end up realizing more and more of what you are not. Because you are not those unconscious patterns of action. I am not the eating of food as I stand. I’m something much more than that, and the fact that I identify with it is just an expression of an avenue on which I can work on. That is the importance of the sadhana, because it opens up the space for transformation by showing you something different from the ordinary. How you react to what is different. And how you evolve your relationship with it. That is what the practice shows to you. May it be anything, but give yourself the permission to do it consistently. That is probably the word that I love the most in the world, because it speaks directly to my capacity of showing up. That is probably what I value the most of who I am, because I will be there. If I commit to something, I will make it, no matter what. That is the important thing. To be there. To show up.

Each time that I write that I feel that I’m melting, because I’m opening for the universe to do its thing with me. It doesn’t matter where I’m taken, it just matters that it happens. For example, right now I don’t feel completely comfortable with what I’m writing. I feel that the way on which I have expressed myself is kind of dull and repetitive and not clear. There is an expectation for me to have kind of ‘more language’ to talk about this thing, and for me to be more ‘scholarly ready’. But the amazing thing is that 99% of the people in the world are not like that, so I’m directing my speech (or what I expect it to be) just to the 1% that is not listening to me because I’m not clear enough. What would happen if I directed it to the 99% with which I do have a conversation going on? How would that feel like to me? That sounds like an amazing experience and avenue for work. That is the message that I have been receiving more and more from all parts. Be simple. Stick to the simple aspect of your message, and that is where you will start having the success that you want. Be simple and clear, and things will happen. Just be simple and evolve with what comes. Iterate till there is enough people listening that you will end up being able to make your point across. Just be consistent with it. Just be clear. Consistency is what drives success in this moment in the world, and I have everything that I need inside for being that consistency. For embodying it. I just need to make the progress that I can with my heart in one hand as a sword of truth. What is my truth? Is my truth the one that the scholars talk about, or is it the one that normal people talk about? Who are the ones that I want to talk to? Who are the ones that will truly listen to me? Who are the ones that are most in need for help? That is the big question that I need to ask, and it is time for me to realize that the people that I will relate to are not the 1%. I have never done. They end up being boring. The ones that I care the most about are the ones that clean the floor, the ones that clean up the streets, the ones that are outside putting all their effort into develop a little bit more of dignity. That is where my message needs to point. For them to stop eating bread in the night. Instead of bread, just breathe. That is the new motto. Change the afternoon bread for breathing. Just for one week. See what happens. Don’t eat for one week, feel that hunger, and let yourself be transformed by that. Holy shit, I have so much willingness to help that I don’t know where to start. Maybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe I just need to start doing it. Go for it, practice with all of what I am, and just be. Go for it, and explore everything that I can be by helping my people to develop a healthier relationship with themselves. Change the TV, the news, for something different. Let me be that different thing. Every day. Consistently. With power. With strength. I tend to waste too much time thinking that it needs to be perfect, but it doesn’t. The only important aspect of it is that it is clear, so that people can follow from there. I have the best teachers of them all right here, right now. What if I start helping them become healthier and healthier every day? The ones that need more help are the poor and the old people, and that is part of the mission of what I’m creating here.

Build up experiences so that old people can gather and have the best time of their life. Is that even possible? Is that even something that will work? Would my grandmother want to go and enjoy some time with me? I don’t know. It is a big exploration. What is in her that she likes doing that I could do so that I could help bond my relationship with her? Which are the means by which I can help her with technology. That is something that brings a lot of willingness to help into my system. The wanting to help bridge the gap of technology and old people. Right now, they are kind of loosing the battle because there is so much that they could do, and they are not doing, because they don’t know how. That is something that could be amazing. Help my parents with their phone publicly. Teach them something new, every day, and with that bridge that gap. It doesn’t need to be something fancy, it just needs to be. That is the nice part. For people to know that I’m the one that will help them, and to start having that connection with them. It will be only two weeks until they start realizing that I exist, and I can accept questions from them and from then on I will never have problems generating content, because all of it would be a consequence of them asking questions. I just want to help. I have always wanted to help.

I remember when I went travelling around the world, every time that I got to a new place I asked someone there to help me translate the basic stuff so that I could go around with my piece of paper asking people that basic stuff. And the number one on that list, always was: Do you need help? People usually learn how to say cheers in other language so that they can go drinking and have a good time, what I learned to say was ‘Do you need help?’. This is something that is very, very important for me to acknowledge, because it is the means by which I better comprehend that aspect of me that has always been present, and that the only thing it wants is to help. Do you need help? I just want to be in service, and by that become free from the burden of having to be someone specific. I just want to be in service, and help people become more of what they already are. Free up the space that is used by the frustration that comes from not being able to use technology in a proper way, and with that, help them use it at the highest capacity of the potential. That is a big aspect of bringing more creativity to the world, because a lot of that creativity is wasted with that friction that is generated between the tool and the person that is using the tool. I guess that it is a good moment to ask:

Which is the relationship between the tool (technology), the friction that is generated in the user because of the lack of experience on using the tool, and the creative process itself? This is a very important aspect of all of this process of becoming present. Because it you are using a particular tool and you don’t have the expertise to use it in a way that helps you do with it what you intend to do, what comes is the frustration of your experience not being something different, something that it ‘should’ be. You may say: ‘I should not be struggling this much, I’m going to stop’. And that is where the creative act stops. That is what I want to delay a little bit by giving the people the tools for realizing that it is a normal part of the process to not be able to use them properly. It is part of the learning curve, and the important part of it is not to give up. It is to realize where you are at, and acknowledge it.

The end of shoulds is about constantly reminding you the place where you are at, no matter with what, and realizing that everything is a path of exploration into what can be after you do it over and over again. That is something that keeps coming to myself, more and more. Because the frustration aspect is something that will always be there, there is no way around it, but there is a way around the necessity of it being different. And that way is the acceptance of where you are at. And by comparing you just to yourself you begin to better embody this acceptance. The only level of measurement of progress is you. Your experience. What you are able to do today, related to what you were able to do yesterday. Or maybe not even yesterday, maybe just a moment ago. The creative process is an exploration into the now, into the present moment. It is the means by which you anchor your self to the experience of what is going on in your domain of action right now, and the way on which you deepen that relationship is by developing a strong taste for the quality of what you do. Care about it. Realize that it is the aspect of yourself that makes you become more of who you are, and that there is nothing more important in the world than that. There is nothing more important than you could do than that exploration. In every moment. In every sense. The inquiry into who you are is the biggest quest of your lifetime, and it will never stop. Because it will never finish. It is an eternal unfolding that happens in front of your experience as a human being, moment by moment, action by action.

As I sit down here to Do The Work and just write, I open myself to discover which is the aspect of myself that is going to shine through my words. I open to the realization that there is something within me that wants to be expressed, and these words are the means by which it is expressed. It is magical, and it is eternal. As you live, you discover more of who you are, just by being a witness of what happens in your experience. You are life living itself through a human being, and every aspect of your experience is a demonstration of that. Open up to that wonder, and enjoy every aspect of it.

That is why old people are in my mind, because at least the ones with which I have a relationship have not had the capacity to express their creative being. And just as I write that I realize how full of bullshit I am, because I am imposing that belief system in them. How could I know? I was thinking about my grandmother not having a creative outlet, but then I watch out of the window and see the amazingly beautiful garden that she has. How can I say that she doesn’t have a creative outlet? Which one could be more amazing than that garden? I just need to take care of my experience, of the way on which I do things, of the things that I value, so that I can heal within myself. It is not my mission to help any other person to realize her dreams, it is my mission to do it for myself, and in that process, it will end up happening for others. But the most important thing that I could do for acknowledging the creative process of others is that: just doing it. That is the perfect aspect of it. Let them have their trip. Let each human being have their own trip, and sit down and just open up to be amazed by it. That is the best way on which I could possibly live my life. By realizing that each and every human being is having his own trip, and it is perfect like that. It shouldn’t be different, anything that should be different is a construct of my mind. Every time that the world should comes into being it is an aspect of mind that is willing to be expressed, and in that sense, it becomes noise. Free up from that noise, and open up to the possibility that the only thing that needs to happen is what is happening right here, right now, as it is. That is the only truth that will ever be. Embrace it, and realize that the only thing that I can do is just be myself. Just be. Just give my best to be present, and enjoy every aspect of what comes from that. Enjoy every breath, every deep breath that I’m able to put into my lungs, because that is the channel towards the now. The breath is the anchor of consciousness. Master your breath, master your life. That is the mantra.

It all boils down to remembering that you are breathing. That is the thing. Each time that you remember, breathe. Just notice it. Just do it. Just DAO it.

--

The state of work is changing. The state of life is changing. The way on which we interact as human beings is changing. It is evolving. There is a much bigger capacity of connecting with those that are different from me through the internet, and that by itself enables a huge exploration into what is possible. By understanding that your beliefs are as valid as the ones of the other person. Open up to the wonders of what is built from that. Every person can teach you something. What comes of the other side of that?

You already are everything that you will ever be. That is the truth of the matter. There is nothing in your structure as a piece of reality that is missing from it. There is nothing that should be there so that you could be more of that which you already are. You are complete. You are everything, right now, as you read this, this moment. Don’t ever forget that. If there are any doubts, ask yourself: Who is the one that doubts? Where is that doubt present? Is it real? Is it permanent? Does it arise and go away? That is the game that you need to learn how to play, the one of recognizing that everything will come and go, naturally and permanently, and you are just part of that river on which life unfolds. Transform your experience into the perspective of the river, and open up to the evolution that comes from that.

Which are the means by which those realizations can be made mainstream? How can the gardener be able to move towards that understanding? Is it really my mission to do that? Perhaps my mission is just to give him my attention by being curious about his present experience as a human being. It is to use the power of who I am to bring him to the present moment, by embodying all of what he is by inquiring into that. It is something that comes up as an answer, but the funny thing about it is that I’m trying to answer that from a place of mind. How can consciousness realize itself through the eyes of another person if even from my own perspective I’m trying to do it from a place of mind? It won’t work like that. It won’t happen through this process. That is why the only thing that I have to care about it to embody that presence into each of my actions, in every moment, without a particular agenda.

If I go to him with the willingness to ‘wake him up’, that won’t happen, because in my actions there is an underlying shouldding, that is connected to the belief that he ‘should’ be awake. And remember that I’m talking about the end of should here, so this is something that needs to be pruned from the experience. It is not helpful, for any of us. Nope, it is just making noise. And it is time for the noise to stop, and let the calmness of the void to shine through that. Through the stillness that comes when the noise stops. The simplicity of it. Yes, the simplicity of everything that is left when there is nothing more left. And if I see him with a particular behavior that I judge as something that is not good for him, see where that thought is coming from. Who is the one that is judging? Who is the one that is erasing the possibility of empathy by trying to change something that is real? That has happened to me a lot these last days, trying to help people. Tring to show them what I perceive that they don’t see, instead of just being there for them. That is what they need from me the most. For me to be there for them. To share with them my whole presence, my whole being, just in a state of curiosity, of wonder, of awe, because of the journey that they have travelled to get to where they are at. I can’t expect him to be willing to educate himself, or to stop the noise, because that chatter is what keeps him alive. Maybe he is not ready to deal with all the emotional pain that is inside him because of what has happened throughout his life. Maybe it is just too much, and it is not my mission to deal with it. It is part of what is real right now, and the best thing that I can do is to acknowledge it and move from there to a better understanding of humanity, but just being curious about his own particular history. That is the game that I need to learn how to play. That is my mission here. To be there for people expressing their pain, to be there for all of what needs to come to come, and enjoy the ride. Enjoy whatever shines through, whatever is shown, because it is another aspect by which the universe becomes conscious of itself. Every experience, of every human being, is more of that exploration. It is not my mission to try to change it, it is my mission to acknowledge it as something fundamentally magical, as a miracle, and be able to move on from there. Every piece of pain, of hatred, of joy, of love, is a feeling that is true in the moment that it is felt, and in the moment on which my mind tells me that there is something that should be changed about that experience, the balance is lost. If I close the door to listening to that person and I open the one for sharing my own belief system and pain, I end up being egocentric. I end believing that what I have done is more important than what they have done, and that is the biggest fallacy of them all. It shouldn’t work like that, and in the future, as more and more people realize the importance of listening, we will evolve towards that. Step by step, over and over.

The human body is the means by which consciousness realizes itself, and the means for that to happen is in the acknowledging that each life experience through which consciousness has had an experience in this realm is equally valid, and it should have a space in the realm of all what is. The fact that I write that it should have a space speaks a lot about where I am at, because it is not that it should. The end of shoulds is the absolute realization that that space is already here. It contains each and every one of us, and it help us be complete in that. Yo be complete in the interaction with every human being, for it to be a miracle. A ritual. What if I engaged in anu interaction as a human being like if it was a ritual? Holy shit, I have a lot of homework to do. There is stuff that needs to happen here, and the perfect moment for it is now. There never was a better moment before. Realize how cool it is, and just be.

There goes the cliché again, and what I’m feeling right now is a strong sensation of being sleepy. There are a lot of things happening inside me, especially in the area where my brain is, and that area feels like it has a lot of samskaras that are being freed. And with that freedom comes the sensations of expansion, and also of a bit of anxiety. There is a deep sense within me that something very deep is unfolding, and I’m going through it right now, in these moments. It is getting more and more intense. Yesterday in the night I sat in meditation for a while and it was huge. It felt like that opening was reaching a tipping point (it has been like that for a while now, I think it is more than one year on which I have been saying that what I feel that day is the most intense thing that I have felt before, it just keeps progressing), and right now I feel that also. Something big is happening, and it is very hard for me to not associate that with the process of awakening. A big part of me tells me that I should not be attached to that concept because that attachment comes from the mind, but on the other side I can’t help but do it because it is what is happening. And if it is not what is happening I’m going to die, and it is ok like that. But there is something very weird going on inside my brain these days, and what I feel the most is this urge, or constant reminder, to just let go. Let go of the control of what should happen. Let go of the control from the techniques. Let go from the willingness for it to stop, because I can’t handle it. It is just what it is, and it shouldn’t be any different. I’m writing all of these words as a testament of what is happening, as a testament of what is going on, so that if something harmful happens to me you know about it. I’m here to take out whatever fear I may have inside by telling you that it is ok. I’m ok. It has always been ok. It may be something fundamentally transforming that which is going on, and it is ok. The pain is ok. The fear is ok. The anxiety is ok. The weird sensations are ok. The excitement is ok. The beer was ok. The joint was ok. The food was ok. Everything is ok. At the end of the day, it will all make sense, and when all the should are left behind, the purest expression of everything that I am will shine forth. Through. It will come as the deepest expression of what a human being can be when it just is. And there is no fluff about it. There is nothing special about me. I just did the work. I just sat down and stared at my own experience as a human being deepening the relationship with every aspect of myself in the process. Making the unconscious conscious. That is the game that I have been playing all this time, and that is what brings me to this place in this moment, being writing these words, this eternal rant of wanting to bring out what is going on in my experience so that I can leave space for what has always been there. This is everything that I have always been, and it is perfect like that. My experience shouldn’t have been any different from what it is. My parents shouldn’t have been different. My grandparents neither. My wife neither. My baby girl neither. They are all perfect as they are, and they are all part of this amazing symphony that is being played right now, in every moment, called life. Everything that I’m writing here is a call to action, it is the means by which I make every aspect of this experience sacred, so that we can together realize how incredible it is to be here. To have this opportunity. We are the consequence of a miracle that happened after a miracle. Each moment in the history of humanity has been a miracle that has built up towards this present moment, towards what is going on as I write these words, as you read them. You are reading them after I wrote them, and that is the perfect invitation to the realization that the present moment is everything that is, because we are both being transformed by the power of them in a timeless manner. It will be stuck in here, forever, and that is all that matters. That is the magical aspect of this whole existence. Time is a consequence of mind. What stays when the relationship with mind is evolved? A different notion of time. An eternal understanding that each moment is everything that is, and everything that will ever be. Now comes the means for bringing this into the world in a way that is conducing for us to relate to each other (and to the planet) in a way that brings the most amount of benefit for all of us, and that is how we are going to make progress. But what is progress, anyway?

It is what is being done, at every moment, by the actions of all of those who act. Of all of what is. Progress is not something that we can decide if it happens or not, it just does. That is the amazing part of the whole game, things just are. What is just is, and all the pages that have been written by this crazy human being are a calling into that. Pointers towards it. Towards the truth. Your own truth.

I can’t find out what your truth is, because it is very deep hidden inside your system. I can only begin to realize which is mine by truly embodying the understanding that there are no shoulds in reality, and that everything is just as it is. What is your truth? Who is the one that perceives it?

Ask yourself these questions until there are no doubts.

This is the pointer that needs to be brought up again and again. Question yourself, question everything that has been understood by yourself as real, and realize what remains as real. What is at the end of all of it? What is that which stays? Who is the one that stays?

We came here to just be. To explore. To witness. To embody. Everything that we are, through the particular lens of who we have been. Your experience as a human being is unique, and the mission that I have is to help you realize that so that you can bring more and more of it into the life of those who are next to you. To each person that you encounter, to each being that is in front of your domain of action. How will the world look like when there is a deep realization that we are all aspects of the same being? How do we relate to each other when there is an embodiment of the truth? Of each of our own truths? What comes at the other side of the acceptance of the truth of each of our own beings?

What is your truth? Where does it come from?

Ask yourself this question, over and over, until there is no doubt about it. If there is any doubt, go in there a little bit more. Step by step, becoming more and more conscious about what is just in front of you. Of this present moment. Of all the present moments that you will go through. Who are you right now? What is present in you right now? How does it feel to be you? Who is the one that is looking at his hands, feeling the touch of the skin, smelling the smell of what comes from your surroundings? Who is the one that listens? Who is the one that is connected to that array of perceptions that come from each one of those senses? Which is the limit of those senses? Where do they stop? Where do you stop? Where does the interface with which you interact with the world stop? Can you make it a little bit bigger? Can you dissolve the boundaries of that which you perceive as yourself and the environment? Is there any boundary at all? Where does the perception of this boundary come from? How does that inform who you are? Who are you? Who are you? Who is the one that is writing? Who is the one that is reading? Who is the reflection that comes as you look at your eyes across the mirror? Who is the one that smiles? Who is the one that feels joy with the smile of a little child? Who is the one that commands the action from each and every one of your limbs? Who is the one that learned how to walk? Did you learn how to listen? Did you learn how to taste? Did you learn how to see? Did you learn how to touch? Did you learn how to smell? Where does all of this come from? Who is the one that is behind all of those phenomena? Which is the canvas on which all of this painting is being displayed? Where is that canvas located? Is that you? When you read the word you, who is the one that is reading?

Inquiry into what is present deep inside you, and open up to the possibility that everything that you have thought that is true until now is just a mirage in the middle of the desert, which will always be playing you the fool because everything that you are is the desert itself, not only the one that is seeking for that mirage. You are the desert, the palms, the mirage and the seeker. You are what is left when the seeker is left behind. You are what is left when there is no you anymore. You are everything that is, everything that was, and everything that will ever be. Close your eyes and let that sink in.

You are everything that is, everything that was, and everything that will ever be.

And you have always been that.

You just don’t know it yet.

Or do you?

This is Dukkha, the maze of the mind wanting to go out of the mind by exploring each corner of the mind. The game of running around in an eternal circle, which is more and more of everything that you are not. This is Dukkha, an exploration into everything that is, by exploring everything that is not, by just making explicit and visible all of what comes. This is Dukkha, the game of emptying all what has ever been, so that from the ashes the phoenix can rise. This is Dukkha, an exploration into the wonders of life, into the consequences of showing up, of Doing The Work.

This is Dukkha. This is everything that I am. Everything that you are through my own experience. In the moment on which you start being, I am defined by that which you perceive about myself. The image that your mind builds up as a representation of what I am. What is left when all those images are left behind? What is left when the only thing that is there is the pure exploration into what is experienced together?

What is left in you when the judgements about what you have been reading are left behind, and you open up to the pure possibility of just being?

What is left in you when the whole notion of you is left?

What is left when there is no left and right, and when there is no right or wrong?

What is left when wrong and right are turned into a continuum, into the eternal exploration of the dissolution of polarities?

What is left when there are no more judgements?

What is left when all that is is just an exploration into what is left when the explorer ceases to exist?

What is left, when fear is fully felt?

What is left, when joy is fully felt?

What is left, when anger is fully felt?

What is left, when every emotion is fully felt?

What is left, when you open up yourself to fully feel?

Bliss.

The pure consequence of our being. Bliss. All what is, in a dissolution of all what could be. Of what should be. Of what is not.

Bliss in the absolute acceptance of all what is.

Bliss in the recognition of the integrity of the present moment.

In the perfection of it.

This is all we have. All we have had. And all we will ever have.

It is time to embrace it. Embody it. And life from it.

It is time to live.

It is time to be.

Be.

It is time to be.
