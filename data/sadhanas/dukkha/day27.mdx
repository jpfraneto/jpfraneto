There is a deep curiosity present today related to how is this going to play out. What comes to mind is moments at school, on which we went to CALL class, where the computers were. In there, we learned English, with a software that was very boring to use. What if they taught us something more interesting? How would that end up looking? What if the system that I’m creating is a network of computer education, for people from all ages? That is it, teaching people how to use computers. From the young ones to the old ones. We all can learn something. There is an aspect of what can be done with computers that can be novel to each and every one of us, and in that, there is an exploration into the creative aspect that each of us has inside.

Computers as the means for developing creativity. That is something new. And the consequence of that exploration into the creative part of each one of us is a NFT, which then can be published and sold so that the person can connect with what was inside. If it is a 6yo, it can be sold to his parents, grandparents, etc. It can be part of the marketplace. It truly doesn’t matter, the only thing that matters is that it exists. What a great idea, having this rooms full of computers so that people can go in there and educate themselves. 90 minutes of full on concentration, bringing about the best that they can. That is something that is always present in me, how to connect the magic of web3 and what is happening in that ecosystem with the real world, where people can flourish because of the consequences of what being inside the internet brought to them.

We go to the internet to expand who we are, so that then we can go out of it and connect to our surroundings in a more sincere way. We go into the internet to become more of who we are. The internet is the means by which we better understand who we are, so that then when we disconnect from it we can offer more of that to each and every one of the interactions that happens offline. That is where we are heading to.

That’s why it is so important to develop community activities that people can relate to in the place where they are at. I predict that in the close future people will go more and more away from cities, and live in places of the countryside where they will be able to live in a different way. More connected to nature, and with a bigger balance between online and offline. When this happens, it will be of major importance to develop means for them to connect with each other on the physical realm, and that is part of the spirit that is being brought up here, in this manifesto. It is very important to be able to balance all the aspects of our existence as humans, and a big part of it is related to how we show up to ourselves and our community when we are not connected.

There is a big aspect of myself that wants to explore this, and learn more about life from the standpoint of those who are close. It doesn’t matter truly if there is resonance between the view of the world, because each part of that dissonance is information that can be helpful for the evolution of each individual. If I go to a place and there is noise present in me related to being there, I can use that noise as a means for deepening the exploration of myself. The internet can induce going into the rabbit hole of only relating to people that I feel comfortable with, and that can be harmful because I don’t expose myself to the uncomfortable. And the uncomfortable is important, because a big aspect of growth comes from there. So there needs to be this balance between the online and the offline, and part of what is being brought up in this document is related to that.

How to use the tools of this day and age to evolve as human beings? What does that evolution even look like? It’s crazy, because we relate to people from all over the world, without even knowing which are the physical circumstances on which that person lives. He may live in the countryside. She may live in the city. On an apartment. On a big house. Who knows. It is part of the mistery, but we tend to create this ‘one size fits all’ ways of building health for example, on which there is a health plan built for a particular kind of person, and we don’t have into consideration which is the particular way of living that that person has. Holy shit, again I’m all over the place, because I want to fix everything. I want to develop the means for helping each one of us, in every realm, in every way. And that doesn’t help me to be focused. And I know that I have to be focused. Which is going to be my main focus? How will I create all of what I’m creating?

What makes more sense right now is to start the next transformational journey working with a new software, and exploring it as much as I can during those 21 days. Creating with it an NFT, and developing a community of learning around the craft for those 21 days. I will create a new twitter profile and follow all the leaders in that domain, so that with that I can explore into the knowledge of that particular thing. I will create from the heart, exploring what comes. Being present in each moment, and just building from there. That will be the means by which I learn to learn. I learn to learn by giving myself the space to create. To just be there. Is that the right path? Is it a good idea? I’m not sure about it, it is what comes right now, but I’m not sure if it is a good idea or not.

I’m running in circles with that one. It doesn’t make too much sense, but here I am, running in that circle, trying to explore one more of the many, many ideas that are here in myself. It is cold, the day is starting, and I’m not too connected with what is being written.

Maybe it is time to speak about my meditation. It seems that there is something that is being fixed inside me, as if the samskaras that are being integrated are inside the brain. I sit down and sometimes I feel very weird movements of energy inside the brain, and it is crazy. There is a particular level of feeling stuck, like wanting to experience something more, something deeper, but not being able to reach that place. There is an aspect of myself that knows that I need to give up that search, that quest, and that is what I’m exploring with the practice. But it is very hard. It is crazy how such a simple practice is so challenging, and it is crazy how much of my whole system is being rewired in the process. I feel and know that my nervous system is being built again, and everything that happens is just part of the process. I just need to show up, and be there going through it.

Meditation is the means by which I apprehend in an experiential level the aspect of reality that is most connected to truth: That everything is changing. By sitting down and just being a witness of what comes up, I open up to that field of change, and I become part of it. These days I’m not even using a meditation object, I just go with whatever comes up and stare it. It is amazing. It connects me with the whole history of humanity, because it is a practice that could have been done 2000 years ago the same as I do it now, and that is the amazing part of it. It connects me with every human being that has existed in the history of humanity. It brings humility, and patience, and care. It brings joy, it brings curiosity, and wonder. Yes, a big part of it is connected to wonder. To the wonder to be there to be the witness of whatever will come up.

To show up, and be the witness of what comes up. You will never know, it is always different. The practice is just being there for it. Exploring it. And being equanimous in that exploration.

So was I talking about my process of creating a DAO? Of this process of gathering everything that I am, everything that I have been, into the creation of something that can be manifested in the world? Isn’t that what this whole document is about? Yesterday I read what I wrote for the first two days, and I really like the way on which I write. It may be that this will be useless in the future, but the fact that I can come back here and just realize the way on which I was thinking and talking to myself at this moment of my life, is just incredible. These words are the manifesto of my own mind, of the way on which I think and relate to everything that happens in my life, and in that sense, it is magical. It doesn’t really matter if I’m running in circles, it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t make any sense. The only thing that matters is that it exists. It is that I come here and show up and just write what comes. Something is moving because of that, something is going on, and this writing is an invitation to that openness. I can’t pretend to be anyone different from what I am, and in that sense, the creative process is a reflection.

When you create, you can’t pretend. There truth, your truth, comes forth, because you can’t create something that you are not. As you empty yourself and your expectations of what should be manifested through you, you end up realizing that you can’t pretend. You are what you are, and it is perfect like that. That is what we need really. People that are willing to go into that process of exploration to bring about who they are through the act of creation. That is how more and more consciousness will be developed, as people free themselves from shoulds, and open to ares. The end of shoulds. That is the game that we are playing here, imagining a world in which that word doesn’t exist anymore. And it plays itself even in what I’m writing right now, because a lot of what I have written today is just nonsense, but it truly doesn’t matter. The part of myself that says that it is nonsense is the one that judges, and the part of myself that is proud about this is the one that is willing to show up with the truth. This is the truth of what I am today, this is who I am, and it is perfect like that. I acknowledge it, I celebrate it, I embrace it. It is amazing as it is.

Having the opportunity to share my work with the open space brings the feelings of being exposed. Of not trusting. Of being nervous. Of feeling like an imposter. How many people have never shared their work? I can think about the closest example that I have, my mother. She plays her game on Instagram, always looking to what is going on from behind the mirror, always being a consumer, and not a creator. I truly wonder: What needs to happen for her to become a creator in there? What is missing in her life experience that she finds comfort in that aspect, instead of in the one of sharing her creations so that she can help others?

It is crazy how in our surroundigs there can always be example of things that are going on and that can inform the way on which we do things. Or inform what we think about if we just open to that. Everything that I’m developing here as ideas related to the transition between consumer to creator can be applied to my own life, on which people that are very close to me are just consumers. What needs to happen in their experience for them to shift this? Is is something that they truly want? A big part of me tells me that yes, they want it. They just don’t know how good it feels. They don’t want to be exposed. They don’t want to be criticized.

Why not? What has happened throughout our life that there is such a big resistance for criticism? What does being criticized bring into us? It is related to those basic needs that we have. Of being part of the tribe. A big part of us is fearful of sharing what we have created because we worry about being left out of the tribe. That is what the critic brings. Throwing us out of the tribe. But the thing that they don’t realize is that if they open themselves to share their work, they open up the door for another tribe. One that resonates with that work. And that brings up a deeper level of connetion, of meaning, of community, that was not experienced before. So yes, that is what happens. A person creates something new, she doesn’t want to share it because of fear to this criticism from the tribe, and then she finally crosses this threshold to find out at the other side the meaning that comes from finding her tribe.

They don’t know how it works, because they have never experienced it. How could my mother know how it feels to be part of a community, if in a long time she hasn’t been part of it? Is it really something that she needs? Is it really important for people to share their work, their creative work? I think so. Because in that exposition there is a shift, there is a change. There is an aspect of evolution. Of becoming someone different, because of being able to trust enough in what was created.

Again I’m falling in the trap of separation, because I’m talking about ‘they’. I’m also the same. I haven’t been able to consistently share what I write about, and I’m just stuck in my own void here. I do it for myself, and I’m not open to sharing it with the world. What needs to happen for me to do it? That is the interesting aspect of all of this. As I open up to write, I realize those aspets of myself that have not been integrated yet, and I open up the door for that integration. What can happen if I open up and share my work? What is the consequence of that? There will be a rejection from some part of society, for those that are not open to what I have to say. Is it that hard though? Is it that bad? Of course not. It has never been this easy to be rejected. What needs to happen for us to change the perspective from all the critics? There can be 100 comments below a picture, and we tend to stay with the one that is the harsh one. We filter all the other 99 that are supporting us and we stay with the one that pushes us down. What is this teaching me about myself? About the relationship that I have with myself?

What if I start giving a fuck about that critic?
What if I truly don’t care about it, or just integrate it as a piece of information that is equally valuable than all the other ones?

That is what needs to start happening. A transformation. An opening. To the world. To the critics. To everything that happens when I’m able to share everything of what I am, without the boundaries that the mind builds as the means for preventing that to happen.
