This moment is the gathering of everything that has happened in the whole history of the universe in this word. In this point. In every stroke of each of these letters there is a whole history of movement, of evolution, that reaches its climax in every present moment, no one more important than the previous one, each one of them being part of this constant flux of matter, of energy, that is manifested as what I see in front of me. I can’t say or comprehend on which else it is manifested: it is beyond my rational understanding. I can just confirm that the mystery is there, making its noise, lighting the spark of curiosity deep within. That spark has always been there, have you felt it? How does it feel inside you when you stare at the depths of the sky in a dark night of full moon? What is the message that the full moon is sending to you? Where does that message come from?

At least what comes to me right now is a deep sense of awe. Of inspiration. Of magic. Of what is at the other side. Where are all of those that are not with us anymore? What is up to their being? They are in us, inside us, within us. The consequence of their actions runs through my veins.

In two days is the birthday of the woman with which I have decided to live my life, and what I feel deep inside is to bring her into this moment, as a gesture of gratitude, as a gesture of love. Of knowing that she is the most important human being with which I have spent time, and that every aspect of the way on which we relate to each other is just another avenue of exploration into who we are. I have spent so much energy diving into the inquiry of who I am, and she is the person in the world that knows better the answer to that question than anyone. But I wonder: Am I the image that she has in her experience of who I should be? Of course not. I am a happening, that comes in the exploration of every second that we have together. I unfold in front of her, and she is the person that has seen more of this unfolding because of all the time that we have spent together. What is love? That is the question that comes to me at this time. And there is a slight gesture inside me that tends to look for the answer in google. There is a part of me that wants other people to tell me what love is, so that I know what it should feel like. How I should act when I am in love. What should I bring into the world if I was acting from a place of love. This process that just happened is very representative and informative of my whole thought process. Having inside me the idea that there is someone different than myself that knows better what love is. As if there was a particular answer. As if there should be a particular one.

This is the root of all shoulds. The thinking that the way on which I’m approaching a particular subject is not correct, measured towards a particular expectation, and because of that, the internal judgement that comes. There is a voice inside my head that tells me that the way on which I experience love is not enough, it can be better, and I look for external validation so that I can know where to move towards. Which is the way forward, so that I can be more loving. So that I can express more love. Perhaps if I give her some flowers I’m more loving. Maybe I should listen to her more. Maybe I can offer some ritual. Whatever. These are all aspects of thought that are being built in the middle of my experience of love. Because there is not something that love should be. That is the biggest lie of them all. Love is built on top of presence. Of being there for the other person, as that person is. The moment that I think of her with aspects of her that should change so that I can better deal with them, there is a separation between me and her that prevents me from the experience of complete love. I know this because it is present in me. There are judgements, there are complaints, there are things that could be different, and the fact that I’m not able to fully accept her for who she is in every moment builds up these boundaries. The barriers. And in that sense, love is something that can be trained.

As in meditation, when each time that you go away from the meditation object there is this sudden realization that you are thinking and you go back to it so that you can continue the process, when you build love inside a relationship with another human being it is the same. It is about being there for her. Being there with all of what you are, without wanting to change anything about the experience that the other person is having. Accepting who she is, for what she is. That is the magic of the whole process. Each time that you realize that you are not doing that, that there is a particular judgement going on, that there is an aspect of yourself that is experiencing that moment from a place of separation, just breathe it in and go back to be vulnerable, open, impartial, in awe. Just curious about the human being that is in front of you. Just wanting to know more about what that human is in that moment. We are all unfolding, and there is always something happening inside the other person that could be used as the means for this connection to happen. From heart to heart. The mind is what builds the separation trying to fill in the moments with noise, with chatter so that it isn’t uncomfortable. The mind wants to feel comfortable. And the body also. Maybe there is a visceral sensation present when you are in presence of the other person, and you are avoiding that sensation by bringing up the weather. What if you kept with that sensation and observed with more clarity what it brings into you? What if there was an eternal curiosity of the present moment in every one of your interactions? Of who the other person is, right there, right now. That is what love is. Is an adventure into that exploration. And I have been talking here about the love towards another person, but it is the same for the love towards yourself.

What if you approached every moment of your existence as an invitation to explore what is present in your whole system right in that moment? That is what being present is, just being a witness of what shows up in your direct experience, every moment, enjoying it and discovering it with the eyes of a newborn. Beginners mindset with life. What if you approached every moment of your life with the frame of mind that comes from the feeling of curiosity? Of adventure? Of exploration into the unknown. You are all unknown, it is impossible for you to know what you will think about in the next moment. It is just happening in front of you. It is just a happening. What if you open up to that possibility of being a witness of the unknown manifesting through your actions? What if you open up the window of love, towards yourself? Towards each one of your actions, so that they can be an expression of who you are in that moment. Without judgements, without shoulds. Just as you are, right there, right now. Open up to the possibility of giving yourself this freedom. The freedom that comes from being able to explore. Like a little kid, exploring the world and discovering the wonders of everything that it holds. At first on her back, moving her little arms and legs, discovering that there is something that belongs to that body and that there is a motion that can be commanded from a mysterious place that will make something happen with those limbs. And then becoming a little bit more capable of doing things, rolling on her back, moving her mouth, making noises… smiling. Each moment of our existence is an invitation to the unknown, from the one on which we came to this world. Each aspect of it is a miracle, and what I’m doing here is making it evident so that we can bring more of that awe to our actions as a collective, so that we can truly embrace the miracle that it is to be alive. To be able to feel love. For ourselves. You are the one that has been giving back that look from the mirror since you were born. You are the one that is behind those eyes, and you are the only one that has been the witness of everything that you have gone through. No one will ever understand you, because they haven’t been where you have been, they haven’t seen what you have seen. Stop trying to make people understand you. Help them groove on you. Help them connect with how you feel, with what you want to bring into the world, so that their spark can be ignited with yours. But it is not a game of making them understand, that is a waste of time and energy. Make them resonate with who you are, and in that resonate build together with the understanding of what you want to bring into the world.

Share some of that love with yourself, in the depth of who you are, in the intimacy of your own being, so that it can be spread to the outside as a loving consideration of who they are just in this moment. Accept you as you are in this moment, without bringing into the experience all of what you should be but are not. All of those shoulds are the information related to the aspects of who you are that you are not accepting. If you should be skinnier, there is information in there related to the acceptance that you have of your own body. If you should eat healthier, there is information in there related to the relationship that you have with food. What does it bring into your system? Why are you craving all that sugar? What is hiding behind all that? Open up to a deeper understanding of yourself, of who you are, of what you bring, and start enjoying life from there. Because as soon as you discover that you are everything that you will be, right here, right now, that burden of having to be different will begin to dissolve. And I’m not talking here about being static and not doing anything with your life, I’m talking about the complete opposite. The activity comes from the joy of life. As you become more active, more loving of yourself, you begin to realize that there are aspects of who you are that are just part of you, and you make peace with them. They are part of what you bring into the world.

How can you use them to become more of you?

All love comes forth from an acceptance of yourself, right here, right now. I know that rationally, and here I’ll try to explain a bit more about where does it come from. I’ll try to explain to myself what is this about. So for example if I’m talking to my partner and there is something that she says that triggers me, there is a part of me that doesn’t accept (in me) what was being said, and because of that, it feels attacked. It wants to defend me, so the reaction is to make the other person responsible for my own feelings and emotions. I feel triggered because of what you said, so you are guilty for making me feel like that. But if I say that, there is something that I don’t control in that equation. I can’t control what you say. But I like controlling because it helps me avoid to feel these feelings. They are not comfortable. But what if I just let it in and realized that all of those are pieces of information? How would that be resolved if I just opened to that way of being?

What happens to me a lot is that I want things to go faster. I know that the other person has an avenue of exploration that will help her feel better, so I want to be the one in command of that exploration so that she feels better sooner and the world is a better place. But how is the world a better place if I’m forcing something to happen? It is what I wrote about yesterday with my mother. She is not ready to approach the situation that she is going through, and it is not my mission to do that for her. She will do it when it is her time, and the only loving thing that I can do is be there for her. That comes as one of the purest expressions of love: Being there for the other person. Presence. That is all what it is. Being present for how the other person unfolds as a human being, with her own time, with her own ways.

And what a hard thing that is. I go round and round with that exploration in myself, and I keep falling into the same traps of wanting to be the savior. The one that had the answer. Is it because I’m also trying to defend myself by building up an image in the rest of the wise person that had the answers? Is it because of a lack of self love that makes me search for it outside? It probably is. I don’t love myself enough, so I try to help the rest as much as I can so that they give me the love that I don’t give me. That sounds fair. So how can I better love myself? By being present with who I am, in every moment, in every circumstance. If I get drunk, there is an aspect of myself that is denying the rest of them, and that kind of deception is not helping me to better realize who I am. I am in every interaction, in every moment, with all the beings that I’m with, and as soon as I open up the possibility for exploring this with more clarity (by being present) I will open up the door for being more loving with the rest of the people that I interact with. I don’t give love to them, because I don’t give love to myself.

And that is something that makes sense, and that is opened as an opportunity to get better at it. I can be there for myself. I can continue to move towards that. (I had written ‘I can start to move…’ and I realized that that was also a way of pushing me down, because I have already started. This whole game is a process, and one of going through the thing over and over again. You have to go into the arena, once and over again, until you begin to realize which are the ways on which you act in particular situations. Especially those that most trigger you. Why are you being triggered? What is that showing you about yourself? With that understanding, there will be magic unfolding because there will also be compassion present. That is the most important kind of compassion, the one with yourself. Realize that this whole game of learning how to live with your consciousness anchored to the present moment is a fucking hard one, and give yourself the time and space for doing it slow but steady. That is the thing. Consistency. Day over day. Being there for who you are).

It's funny because I write that and then I think: When I write this, am I acting with my consciousness anchored in the present moment? Am I, right now, living in the present? And a big part of me knows that I’m not, because there is this feeling of separation from experience and experiencer. I am witnessing this whole situation from the cabin of command from which I have done it for my whole life, and that speaks about an aspect of separation that is not yet resolved within me. That is the biggest stone in the path of realizing how to live in the present moment, the fact that there is a person writing these words with a particular intention. It is not that they are just being written, it is that I am writing it. And that I is an interface that nature has built as the means for me to experience the world, to defend myself, to survive, that has worked until now. It has played the game in an amazing way. Kudos for you, my friend. You have done a great job. I’m proud of you. Perhaps that is a good step towards the realization of who I am. Being proud of myself. But not from a place of thinking that I’m in a different place than other people because of it, but just by realizing the power of what it means to see the reflection of myself and say: I see you. I see where you have been. I see what you have seen. I know that you have tried your best. I know that you have given your best. I’m proud of you. You deserve it.

A few days ago I wrote that the most brutal part of the process of awakening was that feeling of not being able to do it. Wanting with all your being something, and having that strong thought inside that tells you that you are not going to make it. That you are not worthy enough. That you don’t deserve it. That is the minds game being played with all its resources, defending itself as much as it can so that it can continue to play the role that it has played until now. Yes. That is the role that it wants to play. Being in command of the experience, with the fear of not being able to do it properly right there, in place.

And what does properly mean anyway? It is still a comparison related to a particular way of doing. There is a good way of doing stuff, and compared to that, you have done it right, so it fits into the category of something that is done properly. How good is that for myself? Thinking about propers or not? It doesn’t help me at all. I mean, it helps in those moments when I’m doing something as I should do it, but what happens in those moments when I’m not? When I diverge from ‘the path’ and I give myself the permission to explore something different? That is when the bully comes in with all its force, doing all the noise that he has available to tell me that I’m not good enough. That I’m not worthy of it. And that is where the lack of self love comes from. From that wanting, from that craving for things to be ‘proper’. Because I want to know if I’m making progress. I want to know if I’m moving towards the correct direction. But what is the correct direction, anyway? What does that even mean? There is nothing like that in this world, it is just a happening, it is just something that is happening and any judgement that I build on top of that is just noise. Noise. It is just the aspect of myself that wants to be in control of what happens. What is at the other side of dissolution? Will I still be there? That is the big question that I want to be answered, as soon as possible, so that I can feel good. But what is feeling good? I truly only know just feeling. Just being with the feeling. That is the truth. The feeling itself. Good or bad, that is a construct of the mind. That mind that wants to be in the commanders seat. I know why that is, but I also trust with all my heart that it is not real. And all this writing is the manifesto of that trust, expressed in words, so that you, dear reader, can know that I was here. In one moment of my existence I was full of fear, of uncertainty, of shit. I’m full of shit right now. But I won’t be forever. Every word that comes out is the medicine that I need to become more of myself. To just unfold with more clarity into everything that I am. That is what I came here, to this world, to do. Express all my being in the material realm, so that I can truly enjoy the gift of being alive. So that I can truly embody love, so that I can offer it as a sacred present to myself, and from there to my wife, to my little daughter, to my parents, to all of those that are, to all of those that were, and to all of those who will be.

And what an amazing machine this body is. As I was making space for the writing to come up with more clarity, I went outside to do some push ups and squats and now I feel the consequence of them in my body. The heart pumping with more intensity, and the feeling of openness that is coming from having done at least that. There is a lot of tension right now in the area of the third eye, and it feels like doing something with the body is a way on which that tension can be moved into other places. But it is definitely there, as if all the energy that is available in the body was drawn to that place by a magnetic pull that is commanded by the power of something that is beyond my will. I mean, there is an aspect of it that I can control as I willingly connect deeper with the breath, or focus in it with more clarity, but it is tough. It has been going on for quite a long time, and I wonder if there will be a day on which I’ll come here to write and I will be able to say. Holy shit, it is not there anymore. I wonder how the world will look life that day, after going through this thing for such a long time. Facing the fears of dissolution. I mean, it’s not fear what is present. It is not something that I can talk about and call it fear. It is beyond that. I remember being at the meditation retreat and asking Iboga to help me let go. Talking with the plant inside me and asking her with all of what I had: Please teach me how to let go. And there were moments in the meditation where I went deep in, and the sensation of not breathing was something that is hard to explain. It has been the most primitive kind of fear that I have felt. The most primal. It came from the depth of my being, and what came to me was that it felt like being born. That’s the kind of feeling that was present in me. A big part of myself wanted to be born again, to come back to life with a new way of seeing, and it was felt that for ‘reaching’ there I had to let go of my life. In the level of sensations. Of feeling alive. It felt that this threshold was forcing me to realize that for getting there I had to give up everything that I new was real, and that was the breath itself. And I was not able to. That is what has followed me ever since: That I was not capable of doing it. That I was not strong enough to go through that. So here I am, talking to myself and trying to force me to think that I will not have to face that kind of fear again. But I will.

Yesterday was the birthday of my grandpa, who died something like 9 years ago, and I wonder the kind of fear that he felt as he was dying. It was very intense, he had a lot of breathing problems, and it could be seen clearly that he was going through intense suffering. He could not breath well, and there was a lot of struggle in that process. A big part of me thinks that that is the kind of existential fear that he went through. The one that comes from not being able to breathe. To attach your consciousness to the only thing that has always been known to be true. That you breathe. There is nothing more certain than breathing when you are a human being, and that’s why it is so hard to transcend that aspect of being in order to get to the other side. I was not able to do it in the retreat, a big part of me tells me that it was the threshold that I had to cross, but it was not the time for me yet. It is important to acknowledge that, and to tell myself that the body knows. Nature knows. It knows everything that I have gone through, all of what I have experienced, and that is inside. Those sensations that I was having as I was facing this fear, ready to jump to the other side, but now being able to do it, were real, they are in there, and they inform my whole meditation process when I go deep into the exploration of what is there. It is harder to reach that point now, because I’m not as primed as in the retreat, I’m not here with the help of Iboga, but it doesn’t really matter, because it is how it is right now. The only good meditation is the one that happens, and I’m making it happen, every day, as consistently as I can. I have failed a bit with the arrangement of the timing, but as soon as I open up the space to share it with other people things will start happening.

There is a clear feeling inside me that I need to share my practice so that I can hold the space for other people that need it, so that I can become a node in the world of people that want to go deeper in their meditation. It is not necessarily about awakening, or this, or that. It is about just going deeper in the practice, and for that, you’ve got to do the work. Sit down and stare deep within to be the witness of what is present. Nothing else matters. Everything else is the noise of the mind wanting to control. And there is nothing to control, there is just the practice to go through. Just sit. That’s the main takeway from the whole retreat. Just sit. Everything else will unfold because of that. That is what most resonates with me in this moment, and that is the path towards a deeper understanding of every aspect of my being.

So that I can truly love myself, because of having been able to integrated all of that which I think I am. All of those aspects that my mind tells me that I am, but I’m not. All of those that the mind feels represented with.

What comes now is the interaction that I’ve had with a friend of my father, who constantly tries to fit me into an image that he has built inside of himself related to who I am. The engineer, the yoga teacher, the this, the that. I’m all of that, but much more. I am the unfolding of energy that is happening right now as a consequence of all of that. I’m not that. I’m not the engineer. I am a consequence of all the studies of engineering. I’m not a noun, and no noun makes me feel represented. I’m a verb, which is in a constant exploration, in a constant unfolding, and to which any tag is not helpful. I just am, and in the moment that you tag me what you truly do is discredit that who I am. You create something that I’m not. And when I do it also. When I build in my mind the image of someone that I have been friends in the past and explore what they bring to me from the experience of that image, I’m not allowing the expression of that person in this present moment to inform who he truly is.

A big and loving gift that you can give to other person is to allow them to be who they are, right now, as they unfold in front of you. Don’t put on top of them the labels of who you have inside that they should be. And don’t inform your own thoughts from those labels. Just explore who they are right now. Give yourself that present. Open up to what that gift brings. To be able to be present to the unfolding of another human being. To the mistery of what is alive in her right here, right now. To the wonder of the thoughts that are coming through, to the feelings that arise because of what is going on in that moment in the environment that you are in. Each of those things is a mistery, and one that feels like magic. Life truly feels like magic. It is the biggest gift I’ve received in my whole life.

Anything that you perceive that comes from the image that your systems builds around something that happened in the past, is just that: a thought. If you sit down to meditate and there is an aspect of your being that is identified with an experience that you had in the past, it is part of the illusion. The only thing that is real is the experience that you are having right in front of you right now. And even not that. The only thing that is real is what is behind of that perception of having an experience right now. The truth is behind the object of the senses. What you see is something, but that by which you can see is the truth. What you smell is something, but that by which you are able to smells is the truth. These are all the conceptual understandings that my mind builds in order to make sense of this whole thing, because of what I have inside related to the truth. It is closer than close. It is simpler than simple. That is the thing that my teacher used to tell me. It is closer than close, and the mind is for looking for a particular experience out there, gathering from all of those that have happened until now and with them creating a projection about how the thing should look like. But there can’t be an understanding of how it should look like, because it is not something that can be understood. It is something that beyond the realm of understanding. That is what happens here. The understanding always puts itself in the middle, trying to be in control by predicting what will happen. I need to stop breathing so that the tie that attaches consciousness to my body can be freed. And there goes the quest for stopping the breath. And it goes on and on. Looking for those ways of doing things that make sense in order to make the progress that I want to make. That is the thing. The wanting. The wanting for something particular to happen, because it is the thing that should happen. There goes the magic word again. How can that word be transformed into something different? By trusting. Trusting in the innate intelligence of my whole system as a human being, which is guiding me towards the experiences that I need to have in each stage of the journey. I keep wanting to get somewhere, to wake up, and that whole striving towards it keeps me in the look where I cannot get out from. But how could I truly get out of it? What else could I strive for? I know that there is nothing more important that I could do in my lifetime, and I’m supposed to stop doing it because the act of doing it keeps the whole game moving?

Is this the cosmic joke that they were talking about? Is this how it looks? Is this how it feels? The perpetual motion, the driving around and around and around the maze, with Iboga, without Iboga, with Weed, without Weed, with myself, without myself (not yet), exploring the different avenues of the maze from every perspective that can be apprehended, approached, experienced, and being in the same place from where I started. Or not? Am I truly in the same place? I don’t think so. That would not be fair to what is going on, because there is something within myself that has been moving all this time. The exploration has bear its fruits. There are fruits in place, because I at last I have a different understanding of the process. Yes, the understanding word is the problem, but you got the point. I can’t avoid it. Every part of myself wants to understand, to control, and I cannot integrate it so that it can be transformed into trust. How to go from wanting to understand to trusting? That is the big question in here. That’s what the whole game is about. Transforming uncertainty into trust. Or developing trust within the uncertainty.

I’m just stopping here to acknowledge how tough it is to write. I have been in this only two hours and it feels as if I had run a marathon. Maybe it is because of the emotions that go through. Are there any emotions present? Or I’m just a robot vomiting words that don’t make any sense? I welcome it. I welcome everything that is present. I’m here with everything that life brings. I embrace it, I hug it, and I give all the love that I can to it. I am healing. We are healing. That is the process that is taking place. The wounds that have been in place for a long time are beginning to be fixed, transformed, evolved into something different. We are being born again, as a new species, as an evolved one, and we are healing with the earth. With what is below our feet. With nature that everything provides to us. The wisdom that has always been is arising from the ashes of the depression that comes from that feeling of separation that has been in place for such a long time. And that is getting to the most extreme of it. People are feeling more and more this notion of separation, and it is important for me to be there with everything that I can. To be part of this maze, to embrace it, and to live with it. Bring everything that I am to the equation so that I can just be free. To love myself. The only way on which I will be able to love myself is by bringing everything of what I am into what I do. Integrate all of my being into my actions. Be absolutely present, and sharp as a scalpel in the way on which I interact with the world. That is where the magic comes from. That is the beauty of this whole game. That is the spirit that is behind all of these creations, all of these willingness to explore. All of this willingness to express. I have been expressing myself through all the means that I have found, and that is the key thing about it. Just do it with the heart. It doesn’t matter how good it is, or where does it bring you. It only matters what you put inside so that your particular spark can shine through the action.

The only way by which the act of creation, the creator, and the creation can melt in one is by putting everything that you are into it. Collapsing your whole existence into what is being manifested because of you. That’s what presence is about. That’s how the mystery of who you are can be brought forth. By allowing it to happen. By lowering the boundaries of what the mind perceives as what ‘should’ be, and just permitting the free flow of life force through you into the act of creation. That is how you will become what you create. That is how I become what I write here. Each sentence is an attempt towards presence, towards a way of being that is not related to who I am, but what I am through what I’m doing. It doesn’t really matter who I am, because the answer to that is a noun. And I’m not a noun, I’m not a static element in the universe. I’m ever evolving, ever changing, ever exploring, ever being. I’m just the universe being manifested in a small piece of dust in a particular place in a particular galaxy, and from here, I will explore the depths of everything that is. Because I am that. I am also part of that. I know it from a conceptual understanding, it is part of what my rationality tells me that is real, and it is time for me to apprehend it in an experiential level.

Ok, that’s it. Finally. I woke up. I understand it. I get it. I’m not talking from the sense of I from which I have been talking my whole life. I don’t feel identified with the ups and downs of life. I’m not my thoughts. I’m not that noise that is running through the mind. I’m not the mind. I’m beyond the mind.

Sounds cool, doesn’t it?

It’s a lie. How can I speak towards the truth if I’m even lying to myself? But the nice thing is that I was not really lying to myself, I was just exploring how it felt to write those words. And they felt like a lie, because that is not the truth of what I’m experiencing as a human being right now. What is being experienced is a look that comes from the eyes, the image that comes back from the shadow of the screen of the computer as a reflection of the face that I have had my whole life, and the identification with that face. That is who I am. That is the face that I have always had. There is a perspective of the computer with the speakers side to side next to it, bringing music to the ears, and channeling this exploration with the amazing sounds that a guy name Michael Rasa has brought together. Thank you Michael, it has been quite a ride. The universe is listening through me, I just don’t know it yet completely. I want to know it though. It must feel good to be at the other side.

But good comes from an aspect of separation, it is a comparison and that’s how we go back to expectations. At the other side there is no good or bad. There is no right or wrong. The other side is the place where there is an absolute absence of expectations. How can I say that it feels good at the other side if it doesn’t even feel out there? Or in there? Or only there? I don’t even know how to speak about it. Or towards it? That’s how they speak about it. Towards it. So maybe I should speak towards it. Should I? Hello, you mighty word. I was missing you. I’ve become very good friends with you in these last 43 days. Always making your appearance so that we don’t feel that you have been gone. Thank you for being, you have informed a lot of my existence, by giving me the cues of what behavior to bring forth so that I could be accepted by the world.

But you know what?

I don’t need to be accepted anymore. At least that is the path that seems the most harmonic towards the future. There doesn’t need to be acceptance from the outside. All of it should come from the inside, because that is the only way on which I’m going to be able to speak and live and experience this amazing experience called life from a place of truth. Of my own truth. I’m paving the road here, for all of those that are tired of the lies. For all of those that want to know what is this whole thing about. Will we ever get it? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. But what does matter is this exploration into the unknown. What could be more exciting than going into the depths of what is not known? What comes out of there?

I have walked for two months the streets of india without knowing where I was standing.
I have jumped with my whole consciousness into every piece of music that I have found.
I have explored all the doings that I have managed to make my way to.
I have hugged with my whole being a lot of people, which probably remind me as a person that brought joy to their life.
I have given my best to accept my parents for who they are.
I have done the best I have to love myself.

This whole thing is an exploration into love. How to love oneself. How to embrace every fucking aspect of your being so that you can become more and more and more and more of it. In each second, with each interaction. All of who you are is the consequence of how you interact with the world, at each second, with each being. How do you feel about that? How does it relate to how it should have been? Should it be in a particular way? What is your own truth in this moment?

Who is the one that feels represented when that question is being asked?

Ask yourself that question, until there is no one asking it. Until the truth comes forth.

Family. What an important piece of the puzzle that is. I have given myself the opportunity for the last 6 years to live in the place where part of my family has been developing for almost 100 years, or even more, I’m not sure. The roots of my family are in this place, and in the acknowledgment of that fact there is an incredible value for myself. I have kept trying to run from this place, finding the willingness to go and live to another place, but I keep returning to how important and informative it is to be here. For my little girl to grow in this land. To go and explore this forest, at the back of this piece of land. When I was travelling the world I reached a point (soon) where I realized that I could be roaming around for years without being able to find what I was searching for. The deep and challenging work of facing myself. I was in my comfort zone, relating to people that thought that I was cool, and I thought that also. Making friends with those who better resonated with what I wanted of life. And it is easy that way. The tension that is built up by experiencing the triggers that come when you are in front of your family was freed, but there was always something missing. And I wanted that. I wanted to experience that. So I came to this land, my land, and started that exploration. What a journey it has been. They always say that you can talk to who you were 2 years ago, and help those that are in that part of their journey. But I don’t know even where I could start to do that. It is just too much information to process, and I think I would not be doing them a favor because there is no way on which my experience can be extrapolated to theirs. It is just an invention. They have to make their way through the universe of possibilities on their own. There will be people that will make it effectively and that will feel good with where they are at, and there will be others that will take more time until they reach that point. But I don’t know how my experience could inform others in a way that is not crafted to just get their attention.

If I write a blog post talking about the ’30 things that I learned by walking 2 months in the streets of india’ it feels like grabbing attention just for the sake of it. And I don’t feel comfortable with that. But the thing is that part of me thinks that it is necessary to do that, so that my message can be better spread. That is something that I see happening a lot in the circles of spiritual development. People are too cryptic about their stuff. They speech is too far from the masses, and because of that, it dissolves. But does it truly dissolve, or it reaches those who are ready for it and from there it starts getting the attention that will get the message past the threshold and into the mainstream? That is a constant question inside me. Should I manufacture an artificial message? But what does that even mean? What is an artificial message if I crafted it all the way around? I have this mental model inside me, which is not doing me any good. Why do I speak about it as an artificial message? Does trying to reach of for the masses involve building something that is ‘less me’? But what does that even mean? Who is the one that feels identified when I write about ‘less me’?

That’s a big question, which doesn’t have an answer inside me yet. I explore it as I go, as I craft my message, as I share my voice. I don’t feel completely comfortable with A/B testing what I do so that I can better understand who resonates with it, I feel like I’m selling myself, but at the same time it is an intelligent way of doing things. Will I be transformed by that? Will I become a shallow person who just cares about likes and clicks and followers and stuff? That is the good question. Who are those? I don’t even have the capacity for judging it. It doesn’t make me any good to judge it, actually. I can only speak for myself, and if I don’t ever do it, I will never know. Until now, it has not felt natural to craft my content in a way that is polished towards the audience, but what if I end up doing it? What will I lose? What will I win? How are the things that I will do in the future going to be affected by this? I’m running again in circles, behind my own tail, trying to look for answers where there aren’t any.

It is just incredible how much time we spend in the mind thinking about stuff, instead of throwing them out to the world and being a witness of how the world reacts. You never know. That’s why I’m so drawn to entrepreneurship, because it is something that will challenge me all the time. Being a leader for people in the building of a company that will bring my mission to the world. That is what it is all about. And that’s what I want to bring. Holy shit, there are so many things that I want to bring. I don’t even know where to start.

It's funny that I write that I don’t even know where to start on the 17th page of what I have written in the 43th day of the writing of this book. Can you realize that? How much I blame myself for not being what I shuld be? I already started, I have been consistent, I have put in a lot of effort in this project, and I’m not able to be the witness of that because I need to be something different. More. There should be something happening here more than what is being done now, so that the impact of it could be bigger. That is the eternal noise of what is being talked inside my own head. That is the voice that I’m identified with. Some days I enjoy it, other days I enjoy it even more. Because it is becoming crazy, and all that craziness is shining through every one of my actions. And it feels good to be crazy. To be weird. I have been identifying more and more with being weird, and I feel good with it. That’s one of the few labels that I can deal with.

There is a strong aspect of what is being done in this book related to the invisibility of the process. Almost no one knows how much effort I put into it, and it doesn’t even matter, because that effort is what informs the drive that is within me to keep doing it. It is the same effort that brings me into the cushion to meditate without knowing what will come out of it, how I will show up, how will the whole process unfold. It is part of the loving myself that I spoke about before. It is about coming here to witness what is going to happen in this new day, by just being present to that. To allow it happen, and be the witness of what it brings. That is the magical aspect of it.

That’s what showing up to Do The Work is all about. To witness yourself facing the demons of it not being good enough, and realizing after the fact that well, you did a great job. You came here, again, for yourself. You opened up to the transformation that comes at the other side. And it feels good.

And tomorrow will be a new day, on which you’ve got to come back and do it again. And around and around the calendar, showing up to be the witness of how you are different. How your skills have progressed, how you have become more of who you are by understanding better what you are not. By integrating it in a deeper way. That is the whole game of Doing The Work. Showing up and allowing yourself to be transformed on the process. It feels good that way. It feels good to be yourself.

The amount of perseverance that I have put into this whole process is huge. I have been gifted by the grace of the family on which I was born with the material wealth necessary to not have to take care of having a job that could drain my energy (it’s crazy that that is the perspective that I have about jobs. Wouldn’t it be healthier if I just thought that there are some jobs that are cool out there, and I can have one of those?). Anyway. The thing is that I have been given the grace to not work in exchange of money for something around 2 years. The period of my life on which my baby was born is included in those two years, so I have been able to spend a lot of time with her, which I cherish a lot, and has helped me grow.

But where I was going with this is that when you have everything material been provided for you, at least in my experience, you crave for something way beyond that. You need to live life from a different perspective, because you realize that the economical wealth is just a small aspect of what is much deeper than that. And that is the gift that I have been given, and I have done the best that has been in my hands to make progress in those areas that are different from the material one. I have taken care of my body, I have developed a strong and consistent practice of introspection to deepen my relationship with myself, I have tried as much as I have could to have nice conversations with my parents, etc. It is all part of who I have become because of the decisions that I have made, and I feel proud of it. I have truly given my best. I’m not a person that has wasted his time, because much of what I have done is with the clear intention of becoming more of myself. Exploring life and all of its capabilities in order to lift that fog that is between me and my experience as a human being. And this is where I am at, coming here and writing all of these words as an exploration into who I am right now, in this moment, after all that water has gone below the bridge. It has been quite a lot of water. Quite a lot of experiences, of mornings on my own doing my thing, programming on my own without sharing what I was working in with the world, only building that muscle of perseverance, of self-worth, of trusting myself enough so that I know that those were the actions that were most beneficial to me.

It will all one day make sense, they say, and I’m getting to the point where everything that I have gone through makes sense. And that point is where it is all integrated into what I am now. Everything is transformed into the act of creation that is being manifested right now through me. That is all what matters, being that energy. Bringing that energy to the world. Spreading my voice, my message, so that one day it can resonate with those who will read it. Be there for it. And if no one is there, it truly doesn’t even matter because I’m being transformed, one word at a time. By bringing all of this out of me, I understand myself, I embody my self, and I become more and more of it. And I also move towards that aspect of love that I spoke before as being the most important of them all: The loving of myself. The loving of all of who I am right now, with everything that I have been, and with everything that I will be. The embracing of everything that has happened through me. The integration of it. The acknowledging that it is part of who I am. And the moving with it, towards each new moment that brings up the mysteries of what it means to be a human being.

The universe is in every atom, in every flower, in every piece of existence. What if the next time you had a flower in your hand you witnessed it as if it was the only flower in the universe? How would your relationship to that moment change? Be present with it, give it (and yourself), the gift of acknowledging just being. We are. You are. And that is all what it takes. It is all that matters.
