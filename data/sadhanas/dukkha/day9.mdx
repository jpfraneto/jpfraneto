It’s my daughter’s first birthday, and what is present in me is this willingness to feel different from what I feel. There is a constant sensation present in me related to not being able to provide myself what I need in order to make the progress that I need to make, and that is bringing noise. A lot of noise. It is time to start doing it, so that I can focus on living, on just being. Until now I have not been able to do it because I have not had clarity on which was the message that I wanted to convey, but now it is time to clarify that and move forward with that clarity. I have everything that I need, I just need to see it with more clarity. And witness what doing this brings to me, what writing brings, and how important it is for me to do it so that I can make better sense of everything that is going on in my life. I have not been able to put in the 4 hours that. I promised myself to do, but being in the extremes is like the pattern of action that I have to recognize so that I can be not identified by it. In my mind, it is 4 hours or nothing. There is no middle ground. And that makes me feel like a failure when I’m not able to put in the 4 hours, and it is time for me to realize that that is also a trick of my mind, something that it plays on me to make me feel bad. You are not that mind. You are not what you think you are. You are not the one that is feeling those sensations of not being alone. You are the one that cares, that just wants to give love to his family. And it is time to do it! And a big way of doing it is providing you the time that you need to free your mind from all of this stuff, and coming to write here is the funnel to which all that noise goes. Writing here makes me feel free, so that I can be more of myself with the ones that matter. The family. There is nothing more important than the family.

So how does it feel to vomit a bit of words here? Light. An idea showed up, and it was an important one. And there was no delay on the execution of that idea, and it ended up being something great. It worked. And that is the thing, transforming the ideas that the brain generates so that become a reality, and don’t be attached to them. There is an idea related to a concept to play around with in Twitter, and it feels like a great one, and there needs to be an action for transforming that idea into a reality, so that there is information gathered as feedback from the universe. I guess that this whole game is like that, it is understanding how evolution works but in the human level. Understand the game of biology but in the human perspective, as above so below, and realize that information in all levels can be understood as ways of doing, of acting, that can help me better understand what to do. There is information in everything. Everything is actually information, it doesn’t matter where it comes from. I’m going to play with it, and stick with it, so that it becomes a reality. Evolutions plays its games, I was listening to that in the Lex Fridman episode, the last one, and there is a huge amount information in there related to how evolution works, and how it plays its game so that entities can become what they become. AS I try to dive into the understanding of what I have listened from that episode, it is blurry, because it was a lot of information, but what comes is that, it is the exploration into seeing the reality of my life with the lens of evolution. I have said the last two years that I’m in a process of evolution. What does it take for me to evolve? Who am I when I am evolving? What do I do? It is cheaper than ever to gather feedback from the environment, the only thing that it takes is committing to show up and share with the world all of what I am. The simpler the better. So much time spent trying to get it right, to find the best way to do stuff, but there is no such thing as that. There is only actively trying and doing the best to find out what works. And by saying what works I mean it both in a experiential level (within myself) and also in a environmental/societal level (within the outside). How does that doing resonate with the external world, and how does that impact myself and my way of doing things? Why am I doing what I am doing? That is the interesting question to ask. That is the way forward. Why am I doing what I am doing, and what is the impact that it has in the environment? In all parts of the environment. This is what it means to be conscious, be willing to adapt as the understanding of this is refined. AS there is a clearer understanding of this feedback, of this way of doing, of this thing.

There is a very strong pressure in the forehead, and it has gotten intense since I decided to sit-down and write. It has bee there throughout the morning as I was dealing with the sensations that come up when having the family of my wife in the house. A lot of energy moving, especially related to the ‘give her the presents’ thing. Another thing that my mind is telling me that can be made better in society, which is the way on which we give presents to our children for their birthdays. What could be more meaningful than that? Which is a different way of approaching birthdays? I can’t just criticize without offering a way out. And actually my father offered an amazing way out, which is having given her a picture in a frame. It is a very nice gift. And my mind criticizes him and says that the only reason for him to do it is because it is a picture from the cruise, and he wants to know all the world that he went on a cruise with her granddaughter. And that she was in Turkey and all those things. And that is what my mind tells me, because it is unable to see that he actually cares, and that having gone to the cruise is his own way of expressing what he cares about. It is what he likes doing, it is what he enjoys, and it is ok. Where does the acceptance of this whole thing come from? Where does that anger towards him originate from? It is very much related to the lack of tenderness that I have experiences from him, in a ‘flesh’ level. All his love has been expressed to me with his renunciation of himself to give us everything that we needed. He worked his ass off for that. For being able to go into that cruise, and provide us with what we missed in our childhood. It is time for me to recognize that, and recognize that he will never be the person that I expect him to be. This is what I need to give up, to surrender, so that I can truly feel him for who his is. And appreciate him from who he is. There is an unconscious pattern going on related to me thinking that I will be less valued in society if I love him, because of how shallow he is in my mind. But how can I say that he is shallow, if his whole existence is related to being in service? Isn’t that the deepest expression of love, being in service? And he doesn’t even know that he is like that probably, he just does it. And for me it is harder to accept that, because it is probably something that I aspire to but haven’t been able to transform into a reality. I feel like that with him because I want to be like him. That is the thing. I see him happy, free, and I want to be happy and free. And I’m trapped inside my own mind. Trying to be someone different, expecting to be someone different. But it will never happen, because I am who I am, and I was born in this place because of something. I’m here with him because of something. It is very important for me to acknowledge this in a deep, experiential level, and make that trnasition from judging him to loving him. That is everything I need, make peace with who he is and realize that he is giving his best. He has always been. And so are theater grandparents of my daughter, and my wife, and everyone really. How important it is for me to be able to realize this, and embody it. How needed is to be able to do that work, the one of acceptance, the one of realizing the unconscious patterns that command the way on which I behave and from there truly evolve. That is the truth. Facing all the truth of my existence, with all of what it brings. Wherever there is separation, wherever there is an underlying tension inside a way that I have of relating to another, that is pure information that can be helpful for my process of evolution. And that will only happen if I’m able to face that fact, and realize that is will be always present if I’m not able to face it with all what I have. Face the truth and realize that I am that truth. Face that truth until it fades away, because it is not true. It is not true that I am separated from them, what is true is that I am the same as them, more than anything. I am the same as them, and they are my parents. It is time for me to embrace that, and that is the biggest present that I can make to my young daughter. Realizing the huge game that being a parent is, and accept everything that they are so that I can integrate who I am also. I am also a parent that lacks certain things, and in this day it is important to face that so that I can evolve who I am. By accepting what I have done. And being in peace with that.

Today is the anniversary of me becoming a father, and this is the moment when I see myself at the mirror and step down to realize all that has happened in the last years of my life. It is so easy to be caught up on the train, but this is the moment on which I stop to acknowledge the effort to become. To evolve. In so many different areas, and my daughter is a consequence of that. I have not done it perfectly, I have made mistakes, and it has been how it has been, but there is a ever present willingness to be, and that is what sinks into her. She just is, a little bit more than us, a little bit more present. She is the one that I’m paving the road for. For all of those that are being born now, and that will inhabit the world of the future. They will build the world of the future, and if I do my due diligence, I will be paving it for her, for sure. It is just like that, that is the game, and there is nothing else that matters. The only important thing is to realize that the game is played here, today, with my family, with those that will be present and that are the most important human beings in my life and in the one of my little Mila. It is about being present for her. Today is what all the training was for. For leaving the judgements behind, for leaving the willingness to change them behind, and just be. Just be with all of who each of them is, trying to connect with what is deep behind their words, their actions. Being with the part of them that cares, that just is. All what I have done is training for this moment. To enjoy them as much as I can, and realize that all the parts of me that experience separation are something that is built through my experience because of something that I don’t accept in myself. That is the note to myself: Each part of them that I don’t see is an aspect of myself that I don’t want to see also. Each part of them that I judge is a part of myself that I judge. Have that in mind, and use all that as the means for just enjoying, for just enjoying that it is one year since Mila.
