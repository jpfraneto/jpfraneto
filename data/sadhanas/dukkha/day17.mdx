I have a tendency to over complicate things, and because of that, not being able to create a successful communication between me and the one that I want to reach out with the message. I’m sorry… I’m working on that.

A strong pattern of action is being manifested as I go through this process of writing as a means of integration of what is happening through me. There is clarity related to where this whole thing is going, but it is clear that the way I’m building it right now is not working because I’m jumping over stages of my development. Right now I’m training to be a breathwork facilitator, and I’m going through my process of awakening, and what comes now is that I need to establish myself deeply in those processes so that I can act from there.

As I talk about Dukkha, there is confusion about what it is. The relationship that the project has with the name, why is it about suffering, how will it be played out. I’m very good at having a vision of how things are going to look like in the future, but I’m very bad a realizing which are the steps that are needed to take in order to get there. But is that true? I have had a strong vision for myself, and I have walked every path in the road to get me where I am at now. And I’m building up everything that I am over the bricks of consistency, of sitting down and Doing The Work. Realizing that every major change is built over small changes, and with that, be willing to walk those small steps that bring about the small changes in my every day life, which then add up to big changes that I can’t even recognize because they happened progressively because of the way that I did the thing.

That is something that I need to acknowledge, and embrace, and be proud of. That is something that I want to bring more of to the world. Because overnight successes are not the norm, and are not the way to go. There needs to be a progressive development of the individual in order to get to where he wants to get, and that is what this whole book is about. The power of Doing The Work. Dukkha is just an excuse, a frame of reference that I have built so that I can better convey the message of what is needed to do in order to get there. Big masters speak about it on different ways: Enlightment, Awakening, The Now, Presence, God. Those are all pointers towards a state of being, a way of existing in the world, that is not associated with time.

That is the aspect of the whole thing that I find more fascinating. The trascendence of time. The internalization that it is a human construct, something that is a consequence of the mind, and not a consequence of there being life. Life doesn’t care abour time. If you could talk to your dog about time, he would not understand what you are talking about. The dog just is. It has an internal clock, which accounts for the way that its biology works and gives a certain pattern of repetition to the needs that the dog has, but in its structure of experiencing reality there is not an aspect of being called time.

That is only on us.

And it is not eternal. It doesn’t need to be that way. And what I’m doing here is pointing you, and me, toward the state of being that is associated with the absence of the notion of time. I’m talking about pure presence. This is the biggest gift that you can give yourself in this lifetime, because it means leaving behind all the shoulds. The past should have been this way. The future should be that way. This moment should be different. The way of existing that I’m sharing with you here speaks about the end of shoulds. Erasing that word from our vocabulary, and embracing everything that is, just as it is.

To be clear: There is a big difference between accepting what is as it is and being a passive rock that is just breathing in the world and not activating its life force in any way. Dukkha is not about that. It is about being more efficient with the energy that you have available so that you can direct it to the things that really matter: to the complete expression of your creative potential. There is an incredible amount of energy spent in your system to feed the patterns of behavior that drive your experience as a conditioned human being, and Dukkha is about freeing that energy so that it can be directed consciously towards the object of your creation. To your craft. To the expression of who you truly are. Not who you have thought to be all this time.

It is an invitation to explore. To be the witness of the universe unfolding within yourself. To be amazed. To be open. To bring about what has been waiting in there, latent, expecting for its time to shine. There is a fundamental force within you that wants to wake up, and Dukkha is about creating the means for that force to come forth. It is about building community around this process, so that together the transformational journeys are built in an iterative way. There is no perfect path towards this understanding, and what I’m doing here is opening the door for an exploration into those paths using the experience of all the human beings that will participate. Of all of those that want to be the explorers.

Each one of us is unique on its own way, and the internet gives us the opportunity to connect with people from all over the world. This is a window into the understanding of what makes us different, be amazed by that, but also into what is similar within ourselves. Each person is an individual flame of something much bigger than what we can conceive with the rational mind, and Dukkha is about realizing that flame within yourself so that we can truly build a better world that comes as a consequence of the word love. Pure love. Gratitude. Pure gratitude.

Each Transformational Journey that will be conducted is just that, an exploration, and over time we will be better able to examine the way it worked, and how it didn’t work. It will be very important for the system to have in place methods for each individual to be able to convey how the program helped or not in her path, so that we, as a collective, can make decisions about how to design it for further occasions. These TJs will be organized and conducted in community, and the technologies that are in place in this moment of humanity are a prompt for that. Especially Blockchain, and the way on which it enables a decentralized governance, where the participants of a network will be able to be in charge of how it is developed.

Dukkha is a network, with the specific intention to end human suffering. People from all over the world joining forces to face their biggest fears, the deepest aspects of what they have not resolved within themselves, so that they can become free. And that freedom is the end of shoulds. It is the absolute absence of willingness for things to be in a different way than what they are. The absence of expectations. It is the absence of time, because time is a construct that is built around the notion of wanting things to be different. But there is truly nothing to change: life is change itself. We will walk towards the understanding of this truth together and build up the means for more and more people to do it.

There are uncountable paths that different groups of humans have developed to walk towards the truth of our being. To our connection with god, with our true nature, name it as you want. But those paths have always been centralized, governed by a particular authority that decides which is the proper way to behave. In most of the cases, there has been a specific agenda behind the way on which spirituality has been shown to the world. The truth has been hidden behind dogmas and conditioned practices, which you have to follow in order to be worthy of the truth.

But you don’t need to be worthy of anything. The truth is just within yourself, and in Dukkha we are going to build the religion of the future: A decentralized religion. One without a central authority that commands the way on which you behave in order to evolve spiritually. Nope. That commandment will come from the depth of your being, and this journey will be a quest towards what is your own particular truth.

Ask yourself deep within: What is this truth? Ask yourself this question, over and over, until there are no doubts. Each time a concept arises, ask yourself: Is that the truth? Go deeper into that inquiry, until what is left is not understandable. The truth is beyond what you can conceive as true. There is not an aspect of it that can be comprehended by the ‘you’ that you have been identified with. It is unthinkable. Everything that I’m doing here is just conceptualize pointers towards that truth, but you are the one that needs to travel that path. No one can do it for you. But we will be there, side by side, walking it together. In community. Helping us and the future travelers by finding better ways of travelling the path.

Dukkha is about finding the pointers. Discovering which are the ones that we can create together to foster this process in humanity as a whole. In that sense, it is an exploration into what happens when we open up the door to create a religion together. The religion of truth. We are the truth seekers. We are the ones that are thirsty for it, and that are willing to give up everything to get there. Because you have to. You have to be willing to give up all your world so that you can realize that it was just a concept inside your mind. And be aware: It is brutal. It is hard. You will die. This is the journey on which you will learn how to die before you die. Are you willing to go down that rabbit hole? We are waiting for you.

There is an aspect of this whole thing that is important for me to clarify, and now I will try to do it. In meditation, there is a concept called samskaras, which are the blockages that we have in our system, and that are related to karmic situations that have not been dealt with in the past. As you deepen your practice, you are able to face those blockages directly, and with that, open up the opportunity to integrate them by accepting them as part of reality. There are unconscious aspects of our being, most of them related to fear, anger, or unresolved circumstances, that leave this deep imprint in the way that energy is able to flow within us.

With conscious effort, you begin to have a relationship with them that comes from a place of equanimity, of not wanting to change anything. This enables the samskara to dissolve. The consequence of dissolving them is the free flow of energy, and the ever going expression of consciousness through the individual. As energy becomes free from these conditioned patterns, consciousness is able to express itself fully through you.

My theory is that our society is full of samskaras, and those are the aspects of our relationships that are and have been hidden to our view. Consciousness may be understood as information, and there are systems that are in place that don’t let it flow freely. It gets stuck in the willingness that people have to control. To hold positions of power. To be afraid. The truth is hidden to us, because there are people that don’t want us to know it. To experience it. And I mean the truth in every sense. But with the technologies that are in place, everything will come forth. Everything will be open. Free.

There will be a new understanding of humanity and our relationship with ourselves, and what has been in place until now will cease to have an impact because it is not the most efficient way of energy to move. And consciousness wants to express itself, so it is doing its work. It is opening the pathways, freeing the samskaras. And it fucking hurts! When a samskara is freed in the body, often the sensations and feelings that are associated with it come back. You can experience the most intense pain of your life, or grief, or an urge to laugh. Whatever. The same with the ones of society. We are seeing right now a transformation in the way that all this thing works, and it is showing up as stuff that is not nice. But we will go through it, and what comes at the other side is beautiful.

Blockchain technologies open the world for these changes to happen because they enable information to flow freely within the system of how we relate to each other. It is the evolutionary means that we need to free up the collective samskaras, by building new means for information to flow. Without centralization, and with full transparency. Everything will be in there. There is no way out of it.

Dukkha is about building the religion of the future in the blockchain. A religion that is based on the truth. On your truth. It is not about going to a particular place to please any concept that you may have of what is divine, it is about deepening your relationship with yourself so that you can truly experience what it means to be free from suffering. For you to discover that you are the divine embodied in a human being. For you to create from the bottom of your soul the beauty that this world will see in the coming years. That is the future in which we will live, one based on truth, love & gratitude. We are going to build it together.

Welcome to the next stage in our evolutionary path.

And why building Dukkha inside web3, and why with NFT’s and why blockchain?

Because I feel it. Very deep inside. There has always been a noise inside me, and when I think about this way of moving forward that noise transforms into energy that wants to be in service. And most of the things that I have seen that are being created in this space make me hopeful. It is more than worth trying, because I have the feeling that the people that are part of the community are truly wanting to add their dime to help. Become more connected to our true essence, to what we really are. There is amazing people pushing this whole thing forward, and I want to be part of them. It is about feeling a sense of belonging also. It is about transforming my life force with intention into something that will add value to the whole community.

And also because I want to be transparent. Every part of me wants to be transparent so that I don’t have to waste not even a small amount of my energy into pretending to be something that I’m not. What a waste of my most precious resource. I want to be everything that I am, and embody it. Blockchain gives me that opportunity by making things transparent, traceable, and open. I’m not even close to understanding the implications of building in web3, or the implications of anything that I’ve talked about. But I don’t care too much about it, because I trust. I know that this is something that is being developed every day with people that are putting a lot of effort into it, and I will be one of those. I will be co-creating this new way of fostering quality relationships between humans.

Building the future. Doing The Work.

I want to develop a little bit here what has been coming into me related to the way on which the whole system will work (at least at first. It may evolve afterward as there will be more and more people being part of it and making decisions. Nothing is fixed in stone. I’m just setting in motion a snowball here, I’m not attached emotionally to it growing in any way, my mission is just to throw it down the slope).

So this community of practice will be open to whoever wants to participate, but for that, the individual will have to go through a Transformational Journey. That is the price that they must pay to enter. The first transformational journey will be commanded by me. I had been thinking about using psychedelics as the means for starting the whole thing, but now that I think about it better it makes sense not to do it because it closes doors. There is something that is needed to do externally to get them, and they are illegal in most parts of the world, so this is going to put friction into the system. And I want to eliminate any kind of friction that I can, so we will only work with what is present in every human being that is alive: the breath.

We’ll enter altered states of consciousness just breathing together, which everyone in the world can do, and is completely safe. This practice will clear the way for us to remember how to live in the present moment, and from there, a clear connection to your creative expression will arise. This journey is about learning how to live in the present.

There won’t be a ticket that they will have to pay for being part of the journey, it will be free. The only thing that is needed from them is that during the whole TJ they work on a digital creative project, which at the end of the journey will be transformed into an NFT. This NFT will then be part of the ecosystem of Dukkha, and the artist will be able to sell it or do whatever he wants with it, having a percentage of the money paid in every future transaction associated with it coming to Dukkha (we’ll start with 8%, which can be then evaluated and updated if necessary, in every journey). The artistic project will be created using the MSquared standard so that it can be displayed in as many metaverses as possible.

The world of the future will be a blend of the digital and the physical world, and the idea for this thing is that people are able to share what they have created in the different communities that they will be part of. Eventually, there will be a place in each one of those metaverses where we’ll gather to Do The Work and Do The Rest. Something like the temples that exist all around the world to connect with the divine, but in the digital realm. This temple will exist with the sole purpose of worshipping beauty, and eventually what will happen is that each NFT that will be created in the TJ will be something to decorate the temple. Creating beauty as the means of worshipping life. Holding the space for the expression of beauty that can be created by the presence of each individual human being.

This project will create rites of passage. In modern society there are few events that mark the transition from one stage of life into another, and Dukkha is an answer to that. It is something that is needed. I would have spent most of my life in such a different way if I had gone through a TJ when I was 18, deciding ‘what I would do with my life’. It even sounds stupid to write that, but it is important to acknowledge that in this moment of history most people define ‘who they will be’ through what they go to university to study. And that happens at this moment of life, just after puberty, where traditionally ancient societies had rites of passage that marked the step into adulthood. These gave them the tools that they needed to be autonomous individuals, responsible and conscious. Now there is in place a system that is very different from this, so what is being created here is a new way of doing.

There will be a transformation that will take place, and this transformation will happen with your effort. With your willingness to be transformed. To open your eyes. There won’t be anything else than the truth here, the truth of your own being.

There are places in the whole rest of the universe to study about ancient religions, or traditions, or philosophy, or whatever. This place is not for that. This place will be just for Doing The Work. It will be safe space on which you will realize that everything that you need to be complete is there, within yourself. You are already complete; you just don’t know it yet.

That feels good. I feel that everything is taking its place, and I’m more focused than ever to make this thing happen. To bring it into life. I’ve demonstrated to myself that when I have to Do The Work I don’t have any problem doing it, and it was about time for me to trust myself enough so that I could create something from scratch. This whole manifesto is the way on which I understand everything that I have inside so that I can bring it into life. It is the translation of my own process of growth, of my own evolution into a timeless being. It is the crystallization of everything that I am into something that will add value to the world, because it will help everyone that will be part of these journeys to become a better version more of themselves.

It's about lifting up the fog that won’t let them see what lies just in front.

It’s about discovering who they already are.

There is not too much to say, I feel very complete with what has come up today, but there is still time left so I will just be the witness of what happens. I’m listening to an album from Entheogenic called Enthymesis, and a song popped up that I could not hold myself to start playing in repeat over and over again. It is called the same as the album, Enthymesis, and what a great concept. A quick lookup on the internet brings a way of explaining it: ‘comprehensive thought belonging to matter’. It is a way of speaking about intuition.

And yes, everything that has been spoken until now in these 17 days of writing point towards that, because being present is eliminating the gap between the place from which you direct your actions and the action itself. You become the action. And that is what intuition is about, to relate to life in a way that is not mediated by the mind. It is matter thinking for itself about what to do in a particular situation, and you just being a witness in that cosmic dance.

That is the exploration that Dukkha will bring about. Building systems for you to realize how to relate to life so that you can be in the driver's seat, realizing that you are much more than what you think they are. Lighting up that fire of intuition. Bringing about the animal from within. Free. Alive.

Life is such an amazing miracle, Dukkha is an exploration into what makes it worth living. Into just being.

There may be a feeling of being alone in this journey right now for me, as if there was no one by my side. But each one of those that have gone through this thing is next to me. Holding my hand, and telling me that everything is going to be ok. It is just a matter of trusting and jumping to the other side. As it has been said: ‘Throwing yourself into the void and realizing it is a feather bed.’

Thank you. What is present is not fear, is pure gratitude.
