I’m building a safe container for those who are in the process of awakening. I can’t talk to all the people. It is just not my style. There are many other resources out there that can be very helpful for that, but the way in which I communicate what I have inside speaks a language -at least now- that needs to come out in this way. I’m spending too much of my energy realizing which is the way in which I will share myself with the world, and that is not very helpful. I am running around and around in circles. It is the same as my meditation. I just ended the session and it was very exhausting, with the mind playing the thoughts game and me not being too much able to break free from that game. It was brutal. I try to contain what is inside there like trying to push all the thoughts patterns and all that into a ball and then making an effort to throw that ball outside what I perceive as my consciousness and I really can’t because it is the mind trying to fight itself so I go round and round and round in that process and it is very exhausting and then I want to go out of the meditation because it is too much but I say to myself that those are the moments of the most growth, the biggest predictor of long term results is learning how to do things when you don’t feel like doing them so I stay there in that process trying to not fight myself and just being a witness of all that is going on in there but I just can’t do it properly because there is an aspect (big one) of myself that thinks that there is a proper way to do it when the answer to that riddle is just being. It is just by being that I will be able to realize the true nature of my existence, and that is the true nature, that is the game. I just am. Without any fluff, without any coloring. It is just who I am, it is just what it is.

I go back to the first line of what I write about not being able to talk to all the people and I realize that I truly write for no one. I write just as a means for expressing what is inside me, but there is not a particular aspect of the being to which I write to. Perharps this is a moment on which I could start doing an experiment, and start writing to that aspect of you that is beyond what you perceive as you. Yes. I’m writing to that aspect of you that is the same as me. To awareness. All of what I have been doing these 31 days is to tap into that field of awareness, the place from which the mind is shut down and the only thing that stays is the pure flow of being alive, and from there, explore what that means in my own experience as a human being. I have been directing my speech from my truth to your truth, whatever it may be in your experience. That’s why it always comes with the question. Who are you? What is your truth?

Ask that question to yourself until there is not a question anymore. Until there is no one asking. Be no one. And from there, start exploring what it means to be alive. When I ask these questions, which is the aspect of yourself that feels represented by them? Is that really you? Stop for a moment, and give yourself a bit of time, a bit of permission to just feel how it feels to be you. Who is that you? Where does it come from? Where is it located? Is it felt somewhere or it just is?

Inquire into this truth, like a flashlight looking for something in the dark, until you realize that you are the darkness, you are the light that comes from the flashlight, and you are the one that is witnessing the whole movie. You are all of that, and more. You are the truth. Which is your truth? Where is it? Give yourself the permission to ask these questions, and realize that there is no one there. Be no one.

These are the kinds of mind bending aspects of mind that go through inside as the meditation takes place. There is something like an urge of truth. The urge of realizing the truth. The urge of being truth. In every aspect of my being. There is judgement present related to the capacity that other human beings have for exploring this truth, or the willingness, or the interest, and there is a slight judgement related to me being ‘special’ because I do it more than them and there is nothing more important to do in your lifetime than realizing the truth. I’m so lost that I even no if when I write ‘the truth’ I’m full of bullshit or it is correct. There is an aspect of myself that deep down there knows that there is ‘a truth’, that is constant and the same for all of us, but that aspect judges if for example there is someone that is very identified with an image of god, and they speak from that place, they are talking from that place of truth? Is it truth when there is an external being that I give credit for what happens in my existence? Is it the way on which I can make progress to do through it like that? I don’t really know, and a part of me says that there is no way out of this maze, maybe you will never know. And what if I never know? What would be the consequence of that? Is there any problem with it? Is there anything that can be bad? Is it wrong? How could it be wrong if it is my truth? The truth of what I am experiencing right now is this, is this confusion, is this maze, is this willingness to go out of Dukkha, of transcending this eternal willingness for something different to come out, and just realizing that it is part of the process. Dukkha is the eternal unsatisfactoriness, and here I am, going through it, as I write the manifesto of this whole project. I’m here, expressing my lack of satisfaction, of presence, by building up a reality in my own mind that is a consequence of all the satisfaction that I have gone through. When will it be possible for me to just explore what is? When will it be possible for me to leave besides all what has happened before and just be in this moment? Integrate all what has been and transform it into the pure expression of the present moment. That is the game that I’m playing, the one of the present moment.

Any therapy that you can do, any Work that you can go through, any aspect of your being that plays the game of wanting to resolve something, is tending and moving towards the present moment. That is everything that we have, and everything that we will ever have. These words that are coming through me are an expression of everything that I have been, of all the games that I have played, of all the places that I have seen, and how they are translated into these words is just the consequence of all of what I am right now. In this moment. It is very important for me to acknowledge that, and realize that it is perfect like this. There is nothing more important that could be done in this moment of my life that just sharing how I feel inside, what is present, so that when you read this you can feel that this is something normal. The process of awakening is brutal. It is the end of your world, the shattering of everything that you think is real, into a way of being that is new. Rediscovered. There is a major shift in the perspective of who you think you have been, because suddenly you realize that you are way more than what you thought of. And that process is a miracle. It is incredible. It is everything. It is the truth. But as you go through it, your whole world will be teared up into pieced. It won’t be fun. It will just be. And that is what I begin to realize as I open up to each of this words that comes through, it is the realization that it just is. That the more that I resist it, the more I stay in Dukkha. In this nightmare, in this endless circle of wanting and wanting and wanting to get out. The more you want to get out, the less you actually can, because it is just part of how the game was designed. The designer is truth, so for realizing that the designer and the design is all one and the same, there needs to be absolute purity in the intention of wanting to experience the truth. And there is an aspect of myself that still resists that, it still wants to have the hands in the driving wheel, and through that, explore what comes at the other side with the knowledge of what has been until now. That is the game that is being played, the knowledge of what has been, any kind of knowledge, any particular expectation of how it should be, needs to be dropped off.

The end of shoulds.

That is where the truth starts. The truth is the absolute absence of expectations. It is pure being. Pure expression of everything that you are. Yesterday as I was walking with my little girl I was realizing how much of that she is, how much of that pure being, of that pure expression of life, of exploration, of wonder, of curiosity. Even the smallest piece of grass is a window into the unknown. Even the furthest singing of a bird is the most magical piece of music. Every aspect of what life brings to her experience is an avenue for exploring more of this amazing experience called life, which we all share, and which we have forgotten how to live.

In the wanting to fix how things are, we end up forgetting to just be present to what is.
In the wanting to save the world from the end of it, we forget living what is present right in front of us.
In the quest towards a better way of being, we forget the opportunity that life gives us to just be, in every moment.

We just are. That is all what is. There is no more conceptions about it, no more ways of thinking about it. We just are, and the exploration into what can be is a continual one, that is created in every moment, and that comes from the same place from which awe, wonder and love come. Love for what is, love for what can be, and love for what was. That is the purest expression of what can be achieved in life, the ultimate wonder of what love is. Where is it felt. How is it felt. How is it expressed in the world. I truly think that I haven’t experienced true love, and I’m eager to continue down the rabbit hole so that I can lower the barriers of the expectations that my mind builds, and just explore into what is there. If it is love, enjoy it. If it is anger, enjoy it as much. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. That is the game that we are learning to play with these words, the one of fully feeling every emotion that life brings us. There will be sad ones, happy ones, it is just part of the game. That game that we will learn how to play together, as we move more and more towards the truth. The truth pf being alive. Of being a human being, of being a sentient, loving, caring, human being. Maybe what I’m doing here is useless for the world in the future, but it truly doesn’t matter, because it serves the highest purpose of them all for me: To walk towards the truth.

As I open myself to write these words, as I open myself to share with you what is inside me, I help bring out of my experience what was stuck in there, and I open up the space for what is new. For what wants to shine. To be ignited. For that flame that is in there, latent, waiting for me to light it with all of what I am. That is the gift that I bring into the world, and in that, wonders may happen. Just with the magic of my writing, which the circumstances of my life have allowed me, and that are the means by which this energy that is inside me is expressed.

And of course there is that judgmental part also: Is this truly art if there is no one that is speaking back to me? And I go back to Van Gogh, who just created from the source, without ever selling any one of those pieces. If I open myself for the transformation that comes from the creative act, without caring that much about the consequences of it, there is a deepest aspect of my being that is at work. The one that doesn’t expect something particular to happen. The one that just is. As I write, I just am, and I move towards the understanding of everything that I have always been. What could be more important than this? The creative act is the means by which I connect with myself, so that later I can go outside and just explore what is out there with a new and renewed understanding of what I am. The creative act is the means by which I explore the world, so that later I can go out to it and be present in every moment. As I create, as I write, I open myself to the possibility of wonder. Of joy. Of presence. Each word that comes through my fingers is a deeper exploration into the presence that is within myself, and in that presence, is the power. The power of learning how to be. As I write and I lower the barriers of the mind, the power of it, I become more and more present, and that is what the creative act will bring into the world. Presence. People will train themselves on being present by just being able to create from what is there, in that moment. So yes, I don’t agree with what I read yesterday about art being needed to be shared. I don’t agree with it. I think that it is not something that is true, because there are very big examples of artists that never were able to share their work and they were magical, on their own way. If I open myself to the possibility of no one actually reading these words, there is an aspect of humility present. Who am I writing for? For the truth. For life itself. And life doesn’t particularly care if someone else is impacted by these words by the words themselves, but more by what happened because of the words coming into being. There is a deep transformation taking place within myself as each word comes forth, and in the moment that I open myself to that transformation I am changing the world. By changing my own world. That is the game that I have been learning how to play all this time. The game of consistency. Of presence. Of just being. In the moment. Here. Now. Writing what comes to mind. Expressing what is inside through what comes out at every single moment. Just feeling it, witnessing it, and realizing that it is an expression of the totality. Of everything. What I’m writing here is another aspect of the truth of being, and I honor that. I acknowledge it. I build from there.

I build my own reality from there, so that it can be lived with the least expectations of them all. Life will speak at the end, and it speaks at every moment. The end is this moment, since there is not a particular end. Everything is happening at this moment, and that is all what is. And as I write these words I leave that stuck forever in this page, and I open up to the possibility for it to be the means for transformation to happen. The end is this moment, and it is everything that has always been. The end is this moment. This moment is everything that has always been, and that will always be. The end is here. Now. In this moment, and the means for exploring it fully are just being. Just be here. Now. Just explore what is present in this moment without an expectation of it being different. Ask yourself, who is the one that is reading? Who is the one that is expecting this thing to be different, to go in a specific direction? I’m sorry my friend, it won’t go to any place different from where it is going, and that place is just the end. And the beginning, all at the same time. Here, now. At this particular moment, with these particular beings. Everything that will always be is already here. Matter is not created or destroyed, just transformed. Everything that will always be is already here. Sink it in. Explore what that means. What is your truth related to that meaning? Where do you stand with it? What does it mean for your whole world to realize that you are complete right here, right now? That all of what you will always be, you already are? Everything else is just an aspect of your mind, that wants things to be different, to change in any way. That mind is a construct of your nervous system, and it is not reality. It is not what is real. What is real is beyond mind. It is truth.

Bliss is any emotion fully felt, is what comes up as I talk to a friend that is going through challenging times. A big part of me as I talk to people that are going through these challenging times wants to fix something, to help people see what I see. There is trauma in there that is present. Should I be the one that points it out, or should it be an aspect of how they recognize what is present in them? A big part of me wants to walk this path of the therapist in a good way, of the healer, of the one that is present for the transformation of other beings. How is that present in who I am? How can I be more of what they need? If I’m able to realize certain aspects of what I see in them, and try to fix it myself instead of them, which aspect of myself is putting itself in the middle of the experience? Who is the one that is doing that work? Who is the one that is wanting to change, to fix, to arrange something? Meet them where they are at. That is the motto that is always present, and that is what I need to learn so that I can truly embody the healing aspect of the work that I am doing. Meet them where they are at. That is the game. That is the whole journey that I’m travelling right now, being the witness of trying to find the words that help me help them realize something. But that is not what they need. I can see myself trying to urge the process so that we can go into a different kind of conversation. But that is not what is needed. What is needed is for me to engage from a place of wonder, empathy, impartiality and vulnerability. To feel through them, to recognize myself in where they are at, and from there just be for them. That is what they need. They don’t need me to change something, I just can’t. I’m not the one that is in charge of that process, because I don’t have the amount of information needed for that. They are the ones that have it. No one else than them has it. That is the magic of the whole thing. That is the game that we are all playing here. The game of Doing The Work. Each one of us, in our own experience. With our own life experience, with all that we have gone through. With every piece of it. And from that place of empathy, of just being there for them, create. That is the whole purpose of what is going on through me, to help people connect deeper with who they are so that they can create. Give themselves a space for creation during at least 21 days, so that it can become a habit. A sacred and safe space for them to connect with themselves. That is what is needed. Just people to show up for themselves. No one else can do it for you. It is part of the process. It is part of the journey on which you will embark. It is your mission, your duty and your journey. I can’t walk it for you. For as much as I could want it, as much as I want to share with you where I have been, I can’t. I have been extreme in my own journey, and life has given me an infinite space for exploration. I was born in a very special place, with very special circumstances, and that is what I acknowledge in the way on which I present myself to the different circumstances that are present in my daily life. In the way on which I speak to you. In the way on which I realize that my conversations with every person in the world can be transformed, to be more open, to have a deeper capacity of listening, of understanding. Of recognizing myself in the path of that other person. I am on that journey of discovery, of exploration, of joy.

Of taking off the mask of everything that you think you are, of everything that you think you have been until now, so that the truth can come forth. It will be a brutal process, it will shatter your whole reality, but I’m here for that. We will all be here for that. That is what I’m trying to bring up with this whole project, with this whole way of being, with this whole adventure. I’m trying to help the world wake up, and the only way to do that is to accept in my own life, in my own world, that everything is perfect as it is. Not wanting to change it for others, not wanting to make progress towards something that will never come. Just be there and create. Just be there and express yourself through the interaction with others, and with the creative process itself. You can see yourself in the reflection of your own being in the eyes of the one that is in front of you. Just open up to that process, and embrace everything that comes from there. This is a major mistery, and we are here to explore it together. I wonder how the world will look like when all of us are awake to our true nature. When all those patterns of action that have been built into are experience are integrated, and we eventually realize that we are much more than what we thought of. What are we going to care about? Which is going to be the way on which we relate to each other? Without friction. Friction is going to be something of the past, an invention of the former humanity, the one that was but isn’t anymore. That is the game that we are learning how to play here, and in that whole realization there is an aspect of love present. Of true love. Of love wanting to express itself through the actions of every human being. Of love being the aspect of reality that generates that frictions that shines up the information when something is not in the place that it should be. And there comes that word again. Should. It is perfect as it is. But that friction is shining a light intelligently into your experience. Are you willing to be the witness of that friction? Are you willing to realize how that friction manifests in your own life so that you can evolve with it, through it, from it? Bliss is any emotion fully felt, and this friction can be fully felt. What is the friction showing to you? How does it speak to you? What does it bring? What is the message?

Learn how to recognize the way on which friction manifests in your system. It may be tension in the muscles. A slight frowning in your face. A louder manifestation of words. The tone going up. How are these pointers interacting with your experience as a human being, and which are the means by which they can be used as an instrument for going deeper? Who are the biggest masters that you have in your life? Who are the ones that are giving you the answers that you need to listen? To witness?

Who is the one that feels that friction? Where is it felt? What does it bring up? Who does it bring up? Is there an aspect of the relationship with that person, or with yourself, that is present more now than before? What did that person come to teach you? Where is that clarity? Where does that clarity come from? What is it teaching you? Who is resisting that clarity? What is that resistance telling you about the way on which you have decided to live until now? Who is the one that resists? How does the tension feel like when there is no more resistance to what truly is? How does it feel to give up that resistance? To become free of it? What is present in your system when there is no more resistance? Who is the one that is present when there is no more resistance? What is it? Where does it point to? How does it feel?

Who is the one that feels?

Ponder this question, as deep as you can, until the depth becomes the most shallow aspect of who you are. It is closer than close. It is nearer than near. It is just there, waiting for you to realize that it has always been with you. You just needed to refine the way on which you were experimenting the whole game, and that refining is a consequence of just being. Of exploring. Of engaging with life from a place of just being, from a place of non-mind. Who is the one that has been giving you back that view from the mirror since the dawn of time? Who is the one that has been feeling through your senses since you started to exist? Who is the one that was inside the womb of the mother, and who came into being after that incredible and amazing journey through whatever happened between you decided to come to life and the process of being born? Who is the one that was born? Were you born or have you always been here? Ask yourself these questions until there is no one there. Until the remaining aspect of your experience is just the truth of who you are.

Explore, inquiry into that truth until there are no doubts.

Who is the one that doubts? Who is the one that is confused? Can you truly be confused?

--

What is present in my system as these questions are asked is a deeper willingness to inquire. There is an enormous amount of joy that is brought into my system by helping you in the process of discovery of who you are, because as I do that I also discover more of what I am. It is a loop, and I declare myself guilty of wanting to explore more of what that loop looks like. Of wanting to go deeper into the meaning of what just is. Or maybe it isn’t even the meaning, maybe there isn’t a meaning at all. It just is. What is here, just is, and the one that is searching for that meaning is that aspect of myself that I’m spotting with the flashlight. The seeker. The one that never gives up. The one that runs and runs and runs around the maze and never comes out of it, because it is the maze itself. How can you get out of the maze when you are the maze? That is the question that the mind asks itself, as this path of ‘waking up’ is walked. The mind wants to wake up, and I want to wake up from the mind. And there is an expectation that there is a particular way of doing that, a particular pattern of action that can be gone through so that it can happen.

Where is the instruction manual. I need it please. Dukkha is getting darker and darker, denser and denser. It is a never ending maze, which is built just inside the maze itself. Which is the way out? How can there be a recognition that there is no way out? But there is a way through. Running and running around the maze, just to realize that the way through is by the stillness. It is by the realization that the only way out is through. Sitting down and just being still. That is the means by which consciousness is transcended, by just realizing that is everywhere at the same time. And that time is timeless. It is eternal. The eternal mystery of everything that just is. That is the game that we are playing, and in the moment that I realize that I open myself to the world. To my world. To my being. To all of what I am. Recognize everything that is, through my own lens. Through my own being. Sit down and be still. That is all what matters.

--

The way is through digital art. That is the means by which we are going to be able to transcend who we are. By just giving ourself the space and time to create through the computer without boundaries. That is the thing with the physical space. You always need something more, different, to make the progress that you want to make. Want to start woodworking? You need to buy the wood. And what will happen when the scarcity of wood reaches a level on which we will not have any more available? That is the question that comes. How will we create when that is not a possibility? Yes. Consistency is what drives success, and what will happen in the close future is that by doing 4 hours of deep work every day in a creative act people will become free of what is at the other side. That is the magic of it. Imagine each human being giving everything that she is towards that mission. It feels good.

Now it is time for me to talk about lessons that I have learned by being in twitter all this time.

- Your profile is an eternal work in progress, that gets refined as you make progress in the understanding of what you bring into the world.
- It is the deepest rabbit hole on the internet, and it is fueled by the amount of friction that there is for going from one place to the next one. You can explore blazingly fast what is there, and end up in a universe completely different from what has been.
- Following a person is a decision that should be taken seriously. There needs to be a refinement taken place so that you can get the most out of the process. If you unfollow someone and he or she keeps appearing in your timeline, it is because the algo recognizes in that person something that can be valuable for you. Open up to that possibility, and start over again. But if you don’t recognize the person, just become free of the burden of waiting for it to add value and just click that unfollow button.

The waking up series. That is the value that I bring into the world. Conversations about awakening. Holy shit, this is me finding out new ways on which I bring value to the world… Again. Writing about twitter, then writing about creating another thing, and going round and round in this game of procrastination. Because on the moment I decided to go to twitter instead of just write here, so that I could get a grasp of what was going on in there and participate a little bit in the conversation, I forgot the string that was being pulled here. This is the moment on which I recognize that and come back to what is going on here.

A big aspect of what is perpetuating the ego thing here is related to the one that wakes up. As I write from the perspective of ‘me’, of the person that I have been identified my whole life with, I stick to that perspective more and more. What if I closed that perspective and just opened to the one of being someone different? What if all of what I am was transformed into the character that wants to come into being through me? My character is the one that wants to awaken, and as soon as I share all of this writing from his perspective, I realize more and more that it is attached to my way perceiving myself. And that is part of what perpetuates the dream, the maze, because I cannot become free from myself. I keep running towards who I think I am, and don’t realize that I’m more than that. And the value that being anon brings to me is that, it is the absolute realization that I can be more. I can be more, by presenting myself as no one. As everyone and no one at the same time. As I speak from a place of awareness, of just being. Of just existing. That is the game that I’m playing, and it is time for me to realize it so that it can truly happen. So that I can become free from the suffering of being someone different than myself. Of just being my self. And for that, what comes now is that the annihilation of ego that has to come forth is the identification with the character. As I share what has been written here with my name, there is an identification with the one that wants to wake up. I will never be free from that until I become free of it from a literal standpoint, and that starts in this moment.

The maze of wanting to be no one. The freedom that comes from not attempting it anymore. From just being it. Just be no one. What comes out of there? Who is the one that seeks when there is no more seeking? Where does it stay? I run and run and run in circles, chasing my own tail. Feeling identified with everything that I have been until now. When does all that end? What if I throw an atomic bomb into who I have been until now, and I start truly from scratch? How does that feel like? To give up everything and just explore what it means to be? What is something that I can’t give up? Who are the ones that I can’t give up? That is the question that keeps popping up inside me, as the means for exploring deeper into the consequences of deleting all the history of who I have been. What if I just do it? What comes at the other side of deleting everything that I have been so that I can start from scratch? How is that better than just pruning, eliminating so many things that only the most important ones remain? Perhaps that is what needs to happen. For me to prune, and refine, and accept that I am what my past tells me that I am. A consequence of it. And it is perfect like that, but there is so much noise related to what I can be if I decide to be no one. That is the whole anon thing. Being anon is being no one. Being anon is realizing that I am everything, and putting myself in service of that greater good. Of that thing that is bigger than myself. Of that aspect of my being that just is.

I just want to be! Take me out of this maze. Of the maze of having to pursue a way of being that can bring me and my family into something different than where we are at right now. Adding value to the world means that there is an impression in what I do, in how I present myself, and that value is built over the understanding of what is possible. Of what just is. How am I bringing that value? How am I creating it consistently if I don’t engage with the world in a meaningful way? Am I truly not engaging with the world in a meaningful way? It is so amazing to be the witness of my own contradictions, a few hours ago I was writing that it doesn’t matter if anyone ever reads this, because it is something that will stay there forever as a testament of what happens when you run through your own mind, and now I writing about the fact that no one reads. How can I decide which is the best approach to the whole thing? I guess that it starts with just sharing what is written. It is just by opening myself to what is at the other side of just doing the thing. Just be, and realize what is at the other side. Just be, and be open to the ones that will come. Just be, and enjoy the process. The journey is everything, and all the sensations that come are the perfect information that can be used as the means for putting into the world more of what I am. More of what I have always been. How is it that I show myself to the world? Who is the one that is showing himself? Who is the one that reads? Who is the one that feels?

There comes those questions again, as an exploration. As an invitation. This is my gift, building up with words, creating from that place, and giving up everything that I can so that the truth can come forth. Which is the truth? What is your truth? Only you can answer that. You are the only one that can use the lifetime that you have been here as the means of exploring everything that you will always be. Every aspect of reality is a stepping stone into the infinite void. Every part of it is the means by which you apprehend deeply who you can be. What you can be. Who you can become. What you already are. You already are everything that you will always be. You are complete. You are here. You are.

Let yourself be. Let yourself explore life from the place that comes when there is no mind involved. They call it flow. Presence. It is the place on which skill intersects with the challenge at hand. Which is my challenge at hand? Which is my skill level? What is present? What is here, right now? How am I making the decision to show up? Which is the means by which I show up? By just being. By just exploring the present moment from the perspective of what is through me. Life is living through me. It is not that I am living life. Life is living through me. Life is living through you. Who is the one that I’m talking to?

The one that knows that there is something more. The one that is tired of the suffering, the one for which it is never enough. The spiritual one. What a nonsense. Yesterday I was with my grandmother and someone spoke about ‘being spiritual’. What do you think that that represents in the experience of a woman that has spent 80 years living in a farm, working her ass of every day so that she can feed her family and be the best version of herself? She is the master of a spiritual life, and she hasn’t ever realized like that. She just is. And here I am, trying to portray a ‘spiritual being’, trying to find out what more there is, and running in circles in that eternal quest.

It is time to wake up from the dream.

It is time to stop running. To stay still, and realize that all of that that we are not is a consequence of what we believe in, of what we think defines us, of what we think is present in us in every moment. But there is something way deeper than that. There is an aspect of your being that is hidden behind the layers of what has been, and that process is something incredible. Something that drives the world in many unconscious ways. It is a maze, and that maze is the one of the mind. The mind wants to know, the body wants to feel comfort. Here is someone trying to be the early adopter of a new way of being, of the new humanity, and running around and around in circles through the maze. I guess that that is the game that I set up for myself. I am the one that will be running around always, looking for the thing that has been looking all the time. I am the one that is behind the one that is looking. I just don’t realize it yet.

You are the one that is behind the one that is looking, you just don’t realize it yet. That is the aspect of this thing that wants to be expressed. The simplicity that stays when all the complexity is left out. How can all the complexity of this huge array of words be left out, so that the simplicity can shine forth? Where is that simplicity coming from? Which are the koans that arise from all of these words? Until now, there has been +7000 words written. What if I eliminated all those words and left behind only the ones that are truly valuable? Which are the ones that are truly valuable? How could those shine through? How could those be distilled from all of what has been written here? Perhaps there will be an AI model that will do that. All this writing will be the food from one side. This human being trying to wake up. At the other side, there will be a model that will take in all the wisdom that has been written about waking up, about enlightenment. And the consequence of this thing will be just 88 koans that will be the digestion of all that I’m going through as I write these words. It will be an exploration into that. The book of the truth, dissolved into the intelligence of something that humans created as the means for exploring who we are. That is the input. The output is a dream, a maze, on which I don’t have any clue what will happen. But each koan will be a discovery, and each of them will have a piece of art that will be created by a different artist. That is the game that wants to be played. That is the maze that I’m running into. That is the dream that wants to be dreamed. The artificial distillation of everything that is here into something that is at the other side. What if I write down that program? What if I go deep enough into what can be created that I am the one that writes that program? I am the one that will do it, and this world will be an exploration into it. For each one of these, one input, and one output. One expression of truth, and another expression of truth. One piece of wisdom, and one piece of raw noise. And from there, something will come forth. I will build a machine that will translate everything that has been into what can be. Into a new distillation of the magic that comes at the other side of creating something that never existed before. I transcend the awakening process as I go through it with all of what I am, and each one of these words is the food that will feed what will come. That is the magic. That is the noise. I don’t know how to take out the noise, because I am the noise. So I take myself out of the equation and I just set the noise free. I just do the work, and let the work be the means to the end. I just show up. Who is that I? Who is the one that shows up? Who is the one that ends up showing up in each and every moment? How is this related to all what is? Which is the food for the thought? Which is the means by which this exploration can be brought about? Where is the big distillation of wisdom from which we can learn?

The only way in is through. This will be the first AI generated book, but it will be the consequence of the input. The quality of the output is just a consequence of the quality of the input. What if the input is, on one side, the biggest pieces of art that have been created, and on the other side, the simplest and raw truth that I can come with? What is at the other side? I don’t want you to read all of this, it ends up just being noise. What I want you to read and have in your heart is the consequence of this, how all of what is being written here ends up being the food for what we will recognize as the means by which we will be able to evolve. Humanity is going to evolve, and these words will be the food for that evolution to be brought forth. That is all what it takes. No more, no less. It is just about being true with what is present, and having it in mind so that mind can be erased from the equation. Allow space for being to just shine through, and from there, explore. From there, live.

I am the writer that is merging his craft with something that doesn’t exist yet to distill it into the pure essence of what was being created. To distill it from the source. What was it that wanted to be conveyed through this writing, all this time? I am the one with no preferences, because each preference would be an expression of something that should be. This whole journey is about evolving the relationship with that word, and in that sense, it is the end of shoulds. It is the giving up how it should be, so that the truth of what it is comes forth. And when is the moment on which that AI model is finished? It is never finished. It will never be, so there needs to be a moment on which I decided that it is finished. And that moment will be set up with a deadline, and that deadline will be an exploration into things not to be ‘perfect’, for them just to be. What is coming forth in this project is a new way of being, a new way of creation, which is based on the importance of sitting down to do the work. Of being the work. That is what I am all about, sitting down and just doing it. Being it. There is nothing more that can be said, nothing more that can be explained. It just is. The constant capacity of showing up, every day, to just do it. For the time that is intended. To illuminate from there. To share from there the depth of what is inside. That is the magic that is being brought up by what I’m building here. The magic that comes from staring at the void and being open to what comes from there. The magic of discovering each day more of what I truly am by just being a witness of what comes when the creative act is unleashed. The creative act may be anything. That is the game. But what is important is for it to be something. For it to be. An exploration. An inquiry. An aspect of what is, so that it can truly be. I am here for those that want to Do The Work. Not for the ones that I will have to convince. I’m here for those that truly want to do it. That want to go deep into it and realize that it is feathers bed.

That’s it. Showing up. That is the magic. The end of shoulds is a consequence of just showing up. Of being there, for when things get difficult, for when there is no inspiration. That is a mirage. The only thing that is real is putting in the hours, showing up, and doing the work. That is all that matters. Anything less, anything more. You can spend your whole lifetime reading books about how to live a good life, living the life of others through those stories, but there is nothing as going out and creating your own life. Creating from your own source. That is the mission, the purpose, the joy of this whole thing. Pushing through the creations of what is possible, so that it can shine through. That is the gift that I bring into the world. That is what I came here for. Just to share the consequences of consistency. Of being there. Of showing up. Just show up, and you will shine. There will be magic happening. There will be what needs to take place in order for you to be able to do what you have to do. That’s what it is. That is everything that is needed. Only the persistency, the capacity, the willpower of showing up and facing resistance as your old friend. Resistance is that old friend that tells you that you are doing things correctly, it is that aspect of your being that wants to defend you from what is supposed to be dangerous. It is that aspect of your being that doesn’t trust, because there were moments in your life were you could not trust. Life is like that. And the work that we are doing here is integrating that into what will always be. Into what is, into what has been, and into what will be.

You already are what you have always been. You just need to realize it completely so that you can just be. So that you can act from that place of absolute presence, of just being, of just exploring what is alive in you so that you can shine through. You are life living through you. You are what is left when there is no more you. You are everything and nothing at the same time. You are the magic that shines through each one of your cells. You are the universe expressing itself through a particular arrange of molecules and atoms and a particular configuration that determines who you are right now. Explore that into each one of your actions, by refining, step by step, the relationship that you have towards who you have always been. That is the magic. Become more of who you have always been, by being able to recognize that which you are not. Via negativa. The depths of wisdom that have been explored by humans throughout history is just the eternal truth. I only know that I don’t know. I cannot know, cause every instant is an exploration into the unknown. I truly can’t predict what will happen, even in my own experience, even in my own meditation process. How can this be translated into the way on which I interact with reality? How can this shine the light of this maze that we are in? How can this inform the relationship that each one of us has with himself? That is the game that we are playing, and in that realization, there is magic. There is truth. There is wisdom and there is joy. There is truth. The truth of all there is, and all what has always been. The truth that shines forth when there is no one there waiting for things to be different. The truth that shines forth when there are no more shoulds.

The end of shoulds is the beginning of freedom. It is the beginning of each of us opening to the magic of expressing our pure creative potential into the world. Each human being is a spark of light that can be ignited as the creative act is built around the notion of no-mind. Of flow. Of pure presence. You are more of you when you become no you. When you are dissolved into the act itself. You become the act. I become the words, and I dissolve everything of what I have been into what I’m writing here. This is the consequence of everything that I am, as I open myself to share my truth, the truth, your truth, with the world. And this is the world. This is my world. This is our world. In the moment that the realization takes place that this individual spark of light is the same one that is present inside each and every one of us, the shoulds cease to exist. We become pure presence, and we open ourselves to share our truth. Because there is not a way on which it should be. There is a global acceptance of what it is, in this particular moment, in this particular way. That is absolute and pure freedom. That is what comes at the other side of embracing all that is. Pure freedom. The pure joy of not having expectations of something being different from what it is.

It is amazing to write all of this from my mind. I’m not experiencing that dissolution right now, and it is perfect like that. This are all pointers to the truth, and they are not the truth. Act as if they were the truth, and recognize which is the underlying principles that are present in these words. How can you apply them into your relationship with yourself? How could they inform the relationship that you have with others? When you inquire into that ‘you’, who is that? Who is the one that is seeking? Who is the one that is present? Where has that presence been all this time?

Use all what you have read as a pointer towards something deeper than that which you can comprehend, because every comprehension is an activity of the mind. You are beyond the mind. You are everything. You are what is left when there is no you anymore. Welcome to the future. This is the end of shoulds.
