The biggest gift that you can offer to the world is to wake up. Music is the gift that life gives us to forget that there is something that we use to relate to each other called language and to remember that there is something deep within ourselves that just wants to shine through every one of our actions, interactions and circumstances. That’s the magic, and that is what is being brought forth in this moment and age of humanity where there are more and more tools for the exploration of creativity, and the automation of the chores is offering us more free time. Right now, in this moment, that time is commonly used for consumption, for bringing into the holes of the body energy in one form or another, energy that was created from a place of wanting to please, of wanting to gather attention. A lot of what is in place in what we can consume right now is there just for the sake of firing up the centers in our body that makes us feel pleasure, and that kind of content, at least in my eyes, does not purely come from the heart. There needs to be a shift in the way on which content is crafted, and it is up to us as consumers to start consuming in a different way so that we can push forward content that is more connected to the truth of the person that is creating it.

Which is that truth for you?

Right now we bring more and more pleasure through every hole in our body, and there will be a moment in time -hopefully soon- when people will realize the consequences of doing this mindlessly, and there will be a shift in the way that it is being done. Indulgence just for the sake of it will end, and this will mark a transition into a mix of creation and consumption that will bring forth a new way of existing as human beings in society. I’m hopeful that this will happen, as more and more people realize how good it feels to give up pleasure and find other ways of spending the time that is freed because of the wonders of modern technology.

What comes is food for example, with us being used to not spending time cooking it and just buying it from a place that makes it more easy and fast and comfortable to get it in our plate. This ends up having detrimental consequences in our health, and the fact that we don’t give ourselves the time needed for cooking also dismisses a possibility of the enjoyment of cooking your own meal. We are very deep in the vicious circle of what modern life has brought us, and I predict that this will change in the coming years, as more and more people realize how cool it is to spend time doing things other than consumption. Right now it feels that they don’t have the energy and time because life is too busy, but as soon as they realize that it doesn’t need to be that busy there will be a transformation that will take place.

I’m excited by those possibilities, and how with the help of AI we will be able to reach levels of potential what we don’t comprehend yet. Where will you be in those moments? How are you going to navigate the times between now and then?

What has made more sense for me is to prepare, by training the most important practice that I have discovered: meditation. I have walked a path of education and formal practice that has me right now with the capacity of sitting down and exploring what is there, present, in a way that feels like I’m doing progress. Each sit is a new exploration, and this is a tool and practice that is always there. It comes with me, and I don’t need anything external to practice. That is very valuable. And there is so much that has been written about it, explored, and I’m excited to be part of this realm, of this world. Yes, of the community of practitioners.

Anyway, I don’t know why that came up there, but what is present now is to write about yesterday, when we went to the cinema to see the latest film of Black Panther. Holy shit, I was very excited throughout the whole film, and also excited to be a witness of what is happening in the world of cinema. There is something very important unfolding there, and it has been unfolding all this time really. Cinema is such an important expression of who we are as a species, and the movie yesterday had a mix of themes that make me think that we are moving in the right direction. For example, there was the usage of plant medicine to connect to the realm of the ancestors, and using it as a rite of passage towards a new way of being. There was also the riddles of the mind, as in the first scene the brother of the scientist was dying and the only thing that she did was play with the computer trying to save him, instead of going there and just saying goodbye. There were parts of it where princess Shuri was catalogued as a person which’s mind was prevalent, and in I remember one scene when she was asked: ‘And what does the heart say’?
That is something very important for me to have present, because I am also a person that relates a lot with life from the perspective of thoughts. I think a lot, and my relationship with life is very much mediated by my mind. And that is part of what I’m trying to better understand by coming here and Doing The Work, because it is my attempt to bring more of what I am beyond my mind. By letting my thoughts free, I become more of who I am. I’m less obscured by the games that my mind plays. And that feels good.

The film was awesome, and it brought a lot of perspective into what I’m trying to bring into the world through this writing. At the end of the day, this is the manifesto of what I’m going to build, and all the things that I’m doing in my life have that as the north star. I really want to understand which is the path forward, what I’m truly creating here, and yesterday being there helped me realize a little more what is that about. I’m really messy with my writing today. It feels very weird, and I feel that my brain is kind of a cloud of fog right now. Anyway. What came yesterday is more connected to The Infinite Jest, which is the project that I have been having in my heart all this time. The cannabis ice cream store, which is a dream that I have had for almost two years now, or a little bit more. There is a big aspect of myself that thinks about creating a place where people can go and gather to watch a film, or a concert, and serve them a scoop of cannabis ice cream before so that they can enjoy it a lot.

The important part of what I want to build is that it can be easily replicable in other parts of the world, and that it has the capacity of being built in every place. The idea is that in the long term this will be as churches. If there is a place in the world that has an alkald, there will be a place of these ones. A node. A gathering place where people can go and witness the wonders of what human beings are creating. I’m very inspired by the state of cinema right now. The special effects are opening a big door for amazing things to happen, and this thing is just starting. Wait until AI enters cinema, and the capacity for generating stories is there. The only thing that will be constant is the flow of time, at least that is what is present in me right now. If you consume content in 1.5x, your whole system won’t be as fitted to consume it as if it was in normal playback speed, and that is valuable information for me as I design this future. You may have an AI building the most incredible film on the go, but the capacity that you will have to consume that content will be limited by the amount of time that you have available. But what if we are eternal? What if death is not any more an option? What if biology is not the interface anymore? Who knows what will happen there. See? This is the perfect expression of Dukkha. I’m running around these circles, trying to find the perfect expression of what I want to build instead of just doing it. I’m creating all these stories in the comfort of my own mind, instead of going out there and having them as a reality in the world with which you can interact and enjoy and see if it works for you. The willingness to make the most out of life makes me build all these different alternatives but just in the comfort of it, without transforming them into a reality. And that ends up being noise.

Yesterday something important happened, because before the movie started I started talking to my wife and telling her: ‘Imagine if this place had X, and Y, and bla bla bla’. And she shut me up and told me: ‘Why can’t you be comfortable with what is here? Why is there always something missing?’. This struck deep, because it showed an aspect of myself that is one of the most prevalent in my way of dealing with reality. I’m always thinking about what is missing, what could be better, and how can I create something as a solution to what is in place. Always from that place of criticism, but not offering a solid enough alternative by which people can come together and actually the system can be more valuable to the whole world. How do I make the world a better place if all these criticisms are just in my mind? How can I evolve what I do if it is everything just in there? That’s the noise that is always present, and the expression of how deep inside my mind I am. And I’m grateful that she told me this, because in that moment I felt like: Wow. It's true. I’m imagining a future that is not here.

But at the same time, afterwards I realized that I love those images. I love imagining how the future can look like. I love to have ideas about how things can be evolved, so that we can have a better life as human beings. And there comes the comparison, better. What does better life mean? How is that understanding build inside me? I don’t really know. I don’t know anything. It is just a mystery, one which is being revealed in front of me as I move and move towards something that I don’t understand yet what it is. What is this thing that I’m building? How can I describe it to the world? Is it a network of remote workers? Is it a network of meditators? Is it a network of samurais? What does all of that even mean? I’m trying to fit the pieces of the puzzle, and what comes to mind is to have a schedule of organization of how things are done in every day. We start with an hour long guided meditation, then we go for 3 hours of deep work with the music of an amazing person, then we create art in the physical world for the duration of the album of the day, then we go into an open conversation with the person that recommended that album and then, in the afternoon, we just enjoy being alive, not doing anything, just resting, playing with your children, going for a walk, whatever. And in the night a film, or a documentary, or whatever showcases the amazing creative spirit of so many human beings that have brought to life adventures in a way that we can consume as images and video. See? This is the maze where I’m in, because I have spent something like the whole last 2 years trying to find ‘the perfect schedule’. There is a deep craving in myself to make the most use of my time, so that’s why I bring so much effort into the organization of the day, so that I can get the most out of it. But it ends up being nonsense, because life will arrange it for me anyway.

Today I’ll record an episode of the podcast, and on Wednesday I will start with the breathwork therapy, and things will happen from there. This week is very important actually, because it will mark the moment on which I will start working with someone for helping her. This is the first time that I will hold the space for a person doing this kind of work, and I feel very excited about it because it is what I’m called to do right now. The whole JP cast is just an exploration into who I am by interacting with other people, but it feels that that is the way through. And maybe what will end up happening in this place that I have dreamt about it just my office, the place on which I will work, and the place where healing will take place. And different kinds of healing, not just the one with the breathwork. Eating cannabis ice cream and watching a film that opens your brain side by side can also be healing, and my middle term objective is to have places like that all around the world. Little cozy small places where people can go in and truly Do The Work. Comfortable places. That feel good. Inspiring. Where people can really connect to themselves. There are images running through my mind for a long time, and I really want to transform them into a reality but it is hard. I don’t know how to do it. Maybe I don’t have to grow cannabis, the thing that the world needs is mushrooms. A transformational journey into yourself that is catalyzed by something that is not paid. I can’t sell it. It is not my game. I can just offer the medicine to people and have them be transformed by it. That is not the means by which I will earn the income that will help me live. That I will do it through the internet, selling my coaching services to people that can become better at what they do with my help. We won’t do a lot of sessions, we will do just one, and that is going to be the transformative one. How can I truly transform a person by inviting her to be part of something that will change her world? Yes, that is something interesting, because the podcast will open up that door. It will be the filter of who I want to be there. And the fact that I can create a piece of art and save it as an NFT will be powerful. It feels like a good way to go, to honor them by using the space that I will share with their consciousness (by listening to the album that they chose) to create a piece of art, and then with that piece of art go on and send it to them as an NFT. It seems like a great workflow. It resonates with what I want to bring into the world, because afterwards that NFT will be the means by which they will be part of the community. It is powerful.
