What’s up with my capacity for being consistent? Is this even working? I keep running in circles, not truly knowing where I’m heading to. Into the depth of my own heart, that’s what I’m told, but how will I be able to translate that into something actionable in the world? Which are the steps that I’m going to take so that I can make the progress that I want to make? And what is progress? I’m already where I will always be, it is just an illusion. What wants to be expressed is my capacity for building up cool stuff, for showing up and creating from there. And music is the biggest aspect of what I am that wants to be shown through me. But how am I going to monetize that? Where am I heading to? Which are the aspects of myself that want to help other people, and what do I want to help them in?

A big part of me was thinking today about alcohol. That has been such a big aspect of my life, my relationship to alcohol. I was drunk all the weekend for a big part of my life, as I went to university, as I had so much fun. But I was living a life that was not helping me reach my potential, because of all that numbing that came through that alcohol intake.

If you died tomorrow, what album would you take to the other side? That is the big question that my heart asks. My heart wants connection with other human beings. It wants to be there from them. My heart wants that radio to exist, and have different channels inside it so that people can do their work with it on the background. I love curating content, it is part of what I came here to do, and it is my mission to be able to curate that so I can bring it on. That is what I need to bring. Dimension JP. That is the podcast name that comes to mind now. Bringing people in there and starting from that point. If you died tomorrow, what album would you take to the other side? And research the person. And help her go deep and deep into their experience as a human being, so that from there we can hold the space for each other’s transformation. What if I was there for each of them, all the time? What if that is what needs to happen? And all the complexity that I’m building around the project is just noise, because what is important is the connection with the human being that is behind that complexity, and there is no better means for fostering that connection than a 1:1 conversation. I have always searched that connection, and in the masses it gets lost. I don’t like it that way. I just like it to be deep, meaningful, and complete. No less, no more. It is just what it is. Area JP. That is a name that calls my attention, because it is the same in English and in Spanish. Time to go back in time and search for the conversations that I have already had with people in the podcast. What did they bring to me? And not only in the podcast, in every podcast that I have done. With all of them. Into Tech, Timeless Integration, etc. They all brought something special to me, and to the interaction with that person. That was very valuable, and it is important for me to walk the road of understanding that each human being has something to add to the world, and that in that I can make progress in the understanding of myself through the eyes of them. I become more of who I am by interacting with people like you. With normal human beings like you. That is the power of this thing, and I keep running in circles related to that because there is magic in it. There is magic on having a public conversation. There is value in holding space for the transformation of the other person by opening up the door for this conversation to happen. I keep running in circles with this one, because there is something that has wanted to come out for a long time.

And writing here is how I clarify what I have inside. What is it that I have inside? What is it that wants to be expressed through my interaction with the world? What is it that wants to be brought up? Less noise, more clarity. I just want to bring more clarity, and it is very hard for me to do it. I just keep running in circles. What is it that I’m bringing? Who am I helping? Who do I want to become? I speak about alcohol, and presence, and stuff, but what is it really what I want to bring? What is it that my heart is craving for? In a 1:1 conversation with another human being there is nothing like time present, because you can’t fast forward it. If you are reading, or listening to a podcast, or whatever, you can do those things. You can skip. But if you want to learn how to listen, you’ve got to listen. And what better way of doing it than just by listening? Holding space for that conversation to happen, for it to be available to the world. Jordan Bates wrote that speech is the highest form of hypnosiss, and there is something in me related to that. There is something hypnotic about golding space for the transformation of another human being. What if I open that door and let me be transformed by holding the space for that person? Sharing an hour long meditation won’t help too much, but what if I hold the space for that person to just talk? What does come from there? Holy shit, these last days my writing has been just noise. I feel out of focus. How is this connected to Dukkha? What is dukkha anyways?

Which was the main intention behind it? I’m building from a place of ego, of wanting to bring something that doesn’t exist. But will someone follow me? I’m not sure. What if the chameleon is expressed through different topics? I can talk to guests one month related to building an audience in twitter, and how that is connected to personal growth. The next month I can talk to people from the web3 space, and create from there. Yes, I need to focus on cycles of talking to people with a certain frame of action, so that I can better reach them out. When I did Into Tech, the goal of the conversation was clear, and that brought a lot into the conversation itself. What if I talk about social media as a means of spiritual evolution? How can I frame that in a way that is helpful?

What if I talk about the impact that Twitter has in the life of people? I keep extrapolating into other forms of social media, but that is still adding to the noise. Why do I want to bring in that noise? Is it necessary? I don’t think so. What is necessary is for me to be able to filter that noise, so that people can get to know me for what I am. Beyond the words. I have been using a very complicated language, which brings me away from people. Which isolates me from the 90% of the people. And I’m attached to those that have been listening to me, responding to what I share. I’m stuck thinking that they are the ones that are going to drive my value up, when it is not like that. What is going to happen is that I will grow with people different from them, and I’m going to be able to spread my word with them. Will I change in that process? I don’t think so. I can’t change. What can change, or evolve, is the relationship that I have to myself. It is the relationship that I have been building with my own capacity to create. I have created a lot of stuff, and it is in there, present, waiting for me to realize which is the way on which every part of it will make sense. This is the sense making machine. Me trying to make sense of everything that is inside me so that I can act from there. Every day. Moving towards a way of being. A way of embodying more and more of what I am. Is it necessary to get into the complexities of a new technology? I don’t think so, because the major technology of them all is being able to make people trust you. And how do you build trust? By showing up. How can I make people trust me? By Doing The Work. By showing up. It is time to show up. But what if I start showing up and it doesn’t happen anymore? What do people really need from me?

Where do I want to go? What are the steps that are going to take me there? Who have I been? Who am I going to take to the ride? These are all interesting and valid questions, because they speak about the person that I am, and who I want to become through my own actions. What do I want to do? I want to be able to create. Just create for the sake of it. Build stuff. On the realm that I decide. With the platforms that I decide. May it be program A or B, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that I build, and that I bring all of my capacity into it. 4 hours of dedicated work, of putting in the work, is all that it takes. It doesn’t matter if it is writing, or building a 3d model, or creating music, or whatever. It just matters that it is a creative endeavor. That is the goal. To learn how to learn. Which is the thing that I’m going to create next? How will it fit with the overall hierarchy of stuff? Where am I heading to? How do I see myself?

I want to help people heal. That is the main goal of my life. I want to heal myself, so that I can express all of what I am through the creative act. I want to lose myself in the creative act. Become it. Live through it. And do something valuable from there. Me coming here to write is an expression of that, of what I want to become, because writing is the means by which I have found that I can better discover who I am. But writing to who? What if I spent all my day writing towards other people? What if every piece of writing that I created was with the intention of connecting with who the other person is? What is I truly cared about that person and went deep into that connection by establishing it deeply? Perharps that is a mission that I have for now, being able to connect with the other person and build from there.

The other day I messaged Ryan Breslow and told him that I want to write a book about him. I want to be able to translate his whole story into something that is a consequence of who he is. That every part of my creative endeavor will be just throwing out something as a consequence of what I experience from him. Translate what I am into something that can summarize who he is. That is something new that takes place inside me as an exploration. Another exploration. Holy shit, all this thing is just one exploration after the other one. But the thing is that I need to start adding value to other people in the sense of helping them with a particular problem, so that they can reward me economically and with that I can continue to do it over and over.

The infinite jest is the book that defined me. Which are the main topics of it? Addiction, depression, and entertainment. What if I set those as the goals for my life’s work? The most important mission of my life is to help you deal with those three aspect. How to find a healthy balance? How to integrate all of your life experience into who you are right now so that you can have a healthy relationship with those three things? You have certain wounds in your emotional body that make you think that you are addicted, that there is no way out of it. What if the way out of it was through? What if you could develop a healthy relationship with every aspect of your being that is attached to these particular elements of life? They won’t go away.

I used to be the best drinker that I knew. I had a deep relationship with alcohol. And how I can drink and stop. It doesn’t define who I am by any means, I can control it because I have done the work of better understanding which is the role that alcohol has played in my life. It has been helpful, and it played its role. But my mission is to be the witness of that role, understanding it, and integrate it. It doesn’t define who I am, by any means. Is this where I’m walking towards?

I don’t know. I said that I’m building a DAO to transform life into the intersection of a meditation retreat and a festival, but am I really doing that? I’m not even able to do that in my own life, am I truly capable of holding the space for other people to do it? I don’t think so. But how can I know if I don’t do it? I’m finding the way on which the message can be spread more clearly. Which is this way? Is it truly through what I have been doing? People talk about meditating like a monk, and then I talk to them and they say that they meditate just 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes in the night. What the fuck is that. 5 minutes! That speaks to me about the amount of BS that is present in social media, because people talk but don’t walk the path. They don’t sit. But I do sit. I do care. Which is the moment on which I embrace this and start realizing that what I have for offer is valuable, because there is in me the power of being consistent and putting in the effort that transforms lifes?

Is it truly valuable to sit down and meditate through the album of the day? Is this something that adds value to the world or it is just my ego trying to do its thing? Where is the boundary between what is helpful for the world and what my ego builds as helpful? That is a major trick of this whole thing. The ego building up ideas of how to help, but help itself. The fact that people meditate only 5 minutes speaks to me about how shallow their practice is. What if I just go into social media to practice a mindful social media meditation for 5 minutes? How will that change the way on which people perceive their interaction with the whole platform? I can be the means by which they stop. I can be the present that they give to themselves so that they can truly develop a healthy relationship with the scrolling. Why are they scrolling? How long have they being doing it? Social media as a spiritual practice starts with the acknowledgment of the addiction. It starts with the understanding of what it brought to you. It is the most important thing of our time. What if we start developing a healthy relationship to it? I will teach you how to use social media in your own benefit. To be a master of it. That is the thing. Be a master of social media. It is the stuff on which most of humanity spends most of their time. It is time to do it right. No one taught us how. The only way in is through.

It is time to awaken from the dream. I’m building up my presence, and the one thing that has been revolving the most inside me is this social media as a spiritual practice thing. How to achieve that presence? How to nurture instead of drain? How to make a good use of your time? How to be present with every feeling that is inside you as you go through your timeline? What does that teach you about yourself? How can that enhance your whole life? How can you get out of that trap? People spend countless hours on these things. It is time to get out of there. It is time to start being mindful about your presence. Social media is for sharing your creativity, for connecting with other people, to build up your interests. Be active with it. Be intentional. Which the intention with which I’m going to go into this platform right now? What is it that I want to get out of it?

Each post that I share, each comment that I write can be the means by which I deepen my relationship with the world, and with myself. This whole thing is about leaving the passivity behind, and realizing that each person can use SM as the means of spiritual evolution. Self actualization by discovering how you decide to interact with the world. By better understanding of what do you bring to it, and how do you frame yourself in that understanding. That is the magic. That is the pure magic of this whole thing. Learn how to be a creator. Learn how to manifest your joy. Learn how to develop a deeper relationship with all of what you are by opening up that creative avenue that has been closed all this time. I’m here to help you on that path. I’m here to bring about the best of you. And that starts by realizing why do you consume the content that you consume. Which is the value that it brings into the world? Into your world?

Dukkha is about the end of depression, and what drives depression right now is the lack of meaning. It is the end of depression by opening up all of those creative avenues that we have inside and have been shut down by this modern society. It is about opening that window, and realizing the value that is inside each one of those aspects. NFTs are the way to go, because they represent a digital creation. The people that I follow and that I admire are just talking about creation, about building, about manifesting into this reality what you know is true. What your own truth is. It doesn’t matter if it is A or B. It just matters that it is. The first transformational journey of Dukkha will be related to cinema4d, and we will explore what creativity means from there. It is time for me to open up that door, and invite people that want to enjoy the ride. My style is to put in the work, to create in a consistent way by establishing routines. But this doesn’t mean that for other people it is the same. Respect that, and realize which is the fundamental aspect of what I want to build. A community of people that want to help each other. That’s all. And twitter spaces is the thing. It is where the stuff is happening, and where the magic goes. Let the magic flow. We came here for that. Create, build, and they will come.
