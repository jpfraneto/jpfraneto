The level of control that my being needs to excerpt to feel safe is incredible to me. I really don’t know how it is possible that it is so hard to let go, to just be free from this eternal wanting for things to be different. That is the mind, always looking for separation, with its eternal need for noise. But it is a journey, and I tend to fall into the trap of wanting the journey to end soon so that I can enjoy what is at the other side, not realizing that the whole journey is the nice part, the interesting one, the one that is worth navigating. It is all in what arises in this journey, and how I am able to develop a conscious experience with all of it. As I wrote that down, I remembered that I am breathing, and started making it conscious again. What a nice feeling, that of remembering. Of coming back to the practice. It is forgotten sometimes, but it is like a pendulum, which always tends to go to the center. Or, as Adyashanti would say, my consciousness is like a rocket ship that is lifting off from the ground, but the gravity that is present is so strong that each time it lifts off, it comes back. In this case, the lifting off would be the remembering, and the coming back, the forgetting. I have always been in the domain of action of this gravity, my whole life, but there is a knowing that there is something out there, and an absolute willingness to discover what it is through my own experience.

That is the thing. Experience. It is all within. Each experience that you have gone through in your existence is somewhere there, within, waiting for you to translate it into a way of being. Into an aspect of being. Every time that I go through something there is a remembering of the important aspect of it: How will this impact the way on which I will experience the rest of my present moments in the future? How is this going to help me to live more in the present? That is all what is needed, ultimately. To live experiences that help you more and more to live in the present, because that is everything that you have, and everything that you will ever have. Each time I go through a session of whatever I decide to do, there is this notion present. How is this going to transform my capacity to act from a place of truth? And I guess that is the game that we are playing here. Living different experiences that enable us to make those realizations, in our own path.

The most important thing is that every experience is deeply personal, and that you can’t extrapolate the experience of others into your own. Each of us goes through particular things and has particular dispositions inside, and the important aspect of it is to be able to recognize that the experience of others is helpful for yourself as you are able to tap into the fundamental aspect of what being a human being is, from the experience of that person, into yours. And more importantly, it is the other way around.

Thinking that the fact that other people will benefit from what has happened in your experience is a trick from the ego, because it doesn’t take into account the experience of the other person and how what you are sharing will impact them. That is something that I’m very challenged about, and that right now I’m better understanding as I write about it. The fact that I’m not able to reach out to my audience, or find it, or communicate clearly with the people that will care about what I have to say, and will be helped by what I create, is because I think that my experience can be directly translated into theirs, and that they can benefit directly from reading my own experience, on my own words. This is coming from a place of ego, of wanting them to experience the same as I did.

But it doesn’t work like that. The analogy that I made the other day was that of a bridge. If you yell from the side of the bridge where you are at so that the other person can cross, probably no one will listen, because they are too busy with what they are doing at that side. The thing there is to take all your humbleness, get your shit together, and cross the bridge so that you can experience what is going on at the other side from another perspective. And with that, realize which is the correct way to bring them to where you are at. That is something that is always challenging to me, and I’m learning how to do it as I discover which is the way on which I share myself with the world. Such an important thing to realize that, and as always, it is all about starting. And iterating from what has happened.

That is the game, and that is the trap that I tend to fall into a lot. I know everything that is possible from a theoretical standpoint because of what I experienced in Canada, and I want all the world to live like that, but I miss the way on which to reach that world, so that there can be a transformation that can be fostered by what I do. And that transformation is just within myself, because I want to be heard. I want people to read what I write. I write good stuff, in a good way. It is valuable. And right now, no one reads it, because it gets lost in the translation. It is time for me to realize which is the way on which I’m going to communicate with the world, so that my message can get out there. That is the game. And that is what I have been learning how to do all this time. Learning how to play it. And more than learning how to play it, just playing it. I have done the work also. I have showed up.

And just as myself. That is the thing. I’m a unique human being that brings its own sauce to the game, and I’m here because I want to just be myself. I’m completely authentic, I have nothing to hide, and until now I have been hiding because this authenticity thinking that the world owes me something because of it. There is something different that should be happening because I have done all the work that I have done, and I am where I am at in my path. What a nonsense. It doesn’t work like that. If I have been able to gather the wisdom that I have gathered, it is because of who I am, and now it is time to translate all of that into a language that can be comprehended by the people that have not walked this path. This is a major challenge, because my ego loves to make things complicated.

And I think this is an answer to the necessity that I have for being different than my parents. I grew up in a house where we never talked about things that can be ‘important’ for me in an intellectual level. There is a deep need in me to have this being different, for having had more interesting conversations, of science, of the meaning of life, of what it means to be a human being, all of those things. But nope, we talked about soccer and what was going on in the TV. So I built for myself a shelter in the intellectual level, always wanting to go deeper in that realm so that I could satisfy this enormous need that I have for ‘something more’. There is always that need present. And it doesn’t make me good, because it doesn’t let me realize all the value that was present in my house just because of the fact that my family was always there. My parents were together, sitting down at the table, showing up for each other. No matter how hard it was because me and my brother were always fighting with each other, behaving bad in school, and everything. No matter what, they always showed up. I could spend my whole life blaming them for not being interesting… But when is the moment on which I acknowledge that they did the best they could with the tools that they had at hand?

Perharps this is that moment, because there is a deep need inside myself to just realize that. To become free from the ‘wanting them to be different’, and open to all of who they are. All of what my life has been, because it makes me who I am today. It is brutal to be able to realize that these layers of intellect where built as an answer to something that was present in my life t that moment, and that there is a time to let go of that layers. And probably this is that time, in a way, because being over rational, wont let me connect with people. I stand away, because I rationalize everything and it goes through my mind before than it goes through my heart. And this brings me away from people And I want to be connected with them, they are my gods. Each person, each being, is my own god. It is her and his own god. And this is the time on which I realize that, and I move towards embodying it in every aspect of my being. Because it is not something instant as if I write it down here and ‘Poof!’, it is over. It doesn’t work like that. This is a window into exploring more of what is present. And it is my duty to open that window and walk through it, and that is something that is done every day, as I encounter those situations on which I feel in a certain way. As I encounter every situation really, because they are all means for going deeper into the knowing of who I am. What I bring into the world.

There is an eternal need for me to live life at its fullest, to be the most evolved human being than I can, and the truth is that all of that is a construct of my ego. I am already complete, and time is something that doesn’t constitute the fundamental aspect of reality. There is something deeper than time, more fundamental, and everything that I do, in every moment, can be an exploration into that.

I want to explore a little bit the role of the mentor here. Of the teacher. On this moment, on which all the information is available out there, and it is up to us to find our own internal compass that enables us to navigate the waters of this modern world. I’m thinking particularly about my woodworking mentor. I can go in there, and ask him how to do something, and he will give me the answer and save me a lot of time. But I can also go into youtube and watch a video and learn from someone that is sharing his knowledge with the world in a more open way. And I wonder: Which is the reason that you go to one or another?

One that is obvious is because of the information. There was something that was needed to be done, and there was not a particular knowing of how to do it, so you go to the teacher for him to teach you. But know that information is easier and easier to get, so this one being diluted more and more.

The next one that comes to mind is about the connection. There is a complicity in the relationship that comes from having a person which you trust, and which shows you the way. It is a very big relief for the ego, because you can count on that person to be able to show you where to move to. You don’t need to realize the stuff on your own, and you don’t have to spend the energy of ‘being lost’ and going to somewhere that is not helping you. And it also feels good, because in some way you are avoiding to do the hard work of coming up with the stuff on your own. It relieves the pain of being alone.

And then comes the next one, which is huge right now in this moment of development of the internet: The community. A teacher is a person that gathers around him people that are interested in that same topic. And that is powerful, because it taps into a fundamental aspect of what being a human being is: Being part of a tribe. We are tribal beings, and we just want to belong. And following a teacher of some particular subject that is interesting for us brings us to that tribe. It helps us to belong.

Another aspect is the curation of content. The pointers that they can give you that can help you go in one direction or another. There are the people that truly care about their craft and study it 24/7 so that they can get a deeper understanding of it, and share their knowledge because it is what comes from the bottom of their heart, and there are the people that just do it, over and over, and with that they become really good at it, but always inside their own mind. There is a lot of power in sharing what is known, and this is something that the internet also opens up as an opportunity for our development. It is easier than ever to be a teacher. Everything you need is a camera and a computer, and you can share what you know with all the world.

How am I sharing what I know? Which is the aspect of my being that wants more to be shared with the world? What is the most valuable aspect of myself, that the world could benefit enormously if it was shared by me?

What comes to mind is my capacity of exploring the unknown, which has always been underrated for me. I don’t have any problem to jump in into everything that is in front of me, and that is something that is absolutely valuable. And underrated. It is time for me to start sharing more of this, of me being a chameleon. I truly am a chameleon, and that is the interesting part of this whole thing. Of who I am. I don’t have any problem to go from A to B, that is not where the resistance comes from. My soul feels excited to get to know a little bit more about life by exploring a different avenue. And this goes to the contrary of what they always say, about depth in one skill being more important than shallowness in a lot of them. But it is not like that, I’m not seeing the big picture and giving me credit that I am developing a skill, and the one that is the most important for me in the world: Presence. I’m learning how to live life in the present moment, and right now I’m thinking about the book the art of learning, and how it spoke about being present as the most important skill of them all so that you can truly learn anything. Putting the whole skin into the game. And this connects very deeply with the whole Deep Work and Deep Rest thing, and it is part of what I need to better understand how to frame so that I can build something valuable for the world.

I’m beginning to understand which is the frame of reference that I will use to create, to help people. Yesterday I wrote about social media as a spiritual practice, and today I’m talking about learning to learn as the way on which I want to share myself with the world. I want to teach you how to learn, because the school system has failed us. That is where my energy is going right now, to helping people learn how to learn.

Which is the problem that I’m solving? Which is the problem that I’m solving in myself? My incapacity to focus. I write that and it sounds funny even to read it, because I am focused right now in what I’m writing. I’m putting all my life force into it. Where is your life force going towards right now? The problem is not that I’m not able to focus, the problem is that. I have too many interests. Everything is interesting for me, everything in the world. I can’t decide where to move to, because it is all appealing. And the fact that life gave me the material opportunity to explore has been huge for me as the means by which I discover this, but it is also a huge helper of bringing me into this maze, because with all the options that I have I’m lost. There is a feeling inside that there is something ‘more important’ than another thing, and that’s why I start doing something and then I do another thing and I keep like this over and over iterating, as if I was the only person in the world that has this problem. It is me thinking that I’m special, but I’m not. It is something that happens to all of us, in one way or another, and it is important for me to acknowledge it so that I can realize that I’m not the special one and that all of what I’m doing here is keep hiding from the truth of what I am: Who I am in each interaction with the world. Who I am every day on which I decide to show up and bring my truth.

What is my truth today? What was it yesterday? What hasn’t changed in the meantime? That is the interesting part of it all. To really dive deep into what hasn’t changed, and realize that that is who I am.

All this writing that comes from me, and never connected to how you may feel. I wonder, if there is someone that will read this in any moment of history. How do you feel by reading the maze that I have inside my head? Does it help you feel connected? Does it help you in any way? Do you relate to it? Or am I just being selfish and running through my own mind here?

I told it before, I’m doing my best here to learn how to do this thing. It is quite a challenge. I’m sure that one day we will look back at where we are at now and be amazed by it. How identified we were with the construct that is within our own mind. How that identification was not letting us enjoy life and live to our fullest potential. I guess that it is part of the transition that humanity is going through right now, to this exploration of what is going on. It is very interesting, and I feel honored to be able to be writing these words. Maybe in the future you will be a able to connect a wire to your brain and read them instantly. This is all of what I am. Thank you for reading that. I hope that it brought something to your being. I mean, for sure it did, because if not you would not have been reading all this time. I wonder: What did it bring? How do you feel right now? What is present in your soul? Breathe in, and realize that you are just everything that you will ever be, right now.
