All this thing of ‘becoming enlightened’ is making me go crazy. Some days, there doesn’t seem to be firm ground on the bottom of my feet, and there are a lot of doubts related to the path that I’m walking. Should I keep meditating or that is more of that ‘doing’ that ends up conspiring against the act of just being? I know that there is a should in there, but I truly am going through a phase on which I don’t really understand how to progress. And it feels like something very big to give up my meditation practice so that I can focus on other stuff. On building. On materializing into the world. It makes sense though, to close this chapter of my life by writing this book as the manifesto of everything that I have gone through in this lasts months. Since I read that book “Enlightenment, the damnedest thing” I realized that there was something that I wanted to experience, and the thing is: How bad do I want it? But the problem about that is, is the path that I’m taking the appropriate one for me in this moment of my life? Does life really end if I don’t ‘wake up’ right now? I don’t think so. It doesn’t make sense. I’m here, pushing my best so that I can bring more and more presence into my life, more focus, and I’m still young. It won’t hurt me to stop for a while and just let what comes come, and let what goes go. It feels like giving up, and I don’t like that. But it is just part of what comes, I think. I’m going to give me these last days of meditation practice so that I can push through the last part of the process of writing this book, and then I will stop for a while. It is what makes sense. I need to focus on creating the reality that I want to create, I need to focus on building my company and what is going to bring into my life the motivation and energy to pursue a path of manifesting in the world what I want to manifest.

I started writing this whole book with the intention to clarify what that was going to be, and I’m here, at the same point where I started. I have something like a bit of pressure on top of my head because tomorrow I start a program on which I’ll work on a project that I will build for the next months, and it is going to be amazing to be there with all those people. I still haven’t decided what project I’m going to work on, and that is something that I invest a lot of energy in. When I think of what I want to bring into the world, it is not clear for me. A big part of me wants to create a network of deep work cells in places like my hometown, where a remote worker can have his/her office and work there for 4 hours every day and the rest of it have people coming in and enjoying the amazing set of speakers and the TV that will be there for that purpose. The crazy thing about the world of today is all the opportunities that exist, and how those opportunities feel wide open for me to try. I could be doing anything, and in that, I become lost in the exploration of what can be. That is something that has always been present in me, always trying to get the most out of life by doing as much as I can, by opening the door to do what I can do the best. But it is important to be intelligent and intentional with what I will do, so that I can use it as a stepping stone into the future that I want to build. Which is the future that I see myself in? What are the fundamental expressions of myself that have been showing up in my experience these last years? Something that has always been running around is the need for having a place where I can play amazing music, and have it open for the community. That is something that has always been present as a dream. Having a place in the downtown of my city as the place on which I will work, and have it open so that I can share with more and more people. The album of the day thing is always present also, and the fact that I can push that podcast forward is something that brings a lot of value into myself. The deep work sessions in the realm of technology are also something that is very inspiring for me, and I applied to a crypto startup school with that idea. Is there a relationship between me applying to that school and me getting into this program right now? I think so. There definetly is. Both projects are backed by the same company, and in that there is information related to what should I pursue.

There is also the willingness to bring healing into the world, and establishing a network of people that can work more and more in this. And there is also human music, project that I gave a lot of energy to. And I want to build and ship it. I have been dreaming about it. All this time. Having that space where I can show up and have an amazing conversation with a random human being of the world. And have the space for people to share their deep work music. The radio of the internet. For anyone to have their space in there. For anyone to explore how it feels to just be there and share who they are with the open world. Does this make any sense? It is a place for people to connect with each other. And the important thing that comes to my mind right now is also forecasting how the future looks like. Which is the main trait of the future that I envision? That’s something important, so that I can realize where do I think that we are heading, and with that, explore what can I do to move towards that direction.

Which is the unique set of skills that I bring into the world, and that can help me become more of what I already am?

Having random conversations with people from all over the world is definitely one of them. I’m now with my thoughts revolving around the idea of a 1000 real fans, and I want to better understand where those are. What do I bring into the world that is valuable for others? My capacity for holding space for the transformation of them. That is a big part of the work that I’m doing with the breathwork, and it is important for me to acknowledge that so that I can embody with everything that I’ve got that capacity. Today I’m all over the place, I know it, and I accept it. It is tough for me to have to fit into something that I will do, but is it really? I have built for me the container to write this book for the last 79 days, and it has not been hard actually. It has been very helpful. I have showed up, and I have done the work, day after day. So no, it is not hard for me to fit into something particular, it is just hard for me to decide what am I going to do. And working on human music feels good, because it is a new way of doing things. It is an app that has not been created before, it is part of what I bring into the world, it is part of the magic of who I am. Shining a light into the life of others, so that I can bring more of it into the world. That is something that I’m very good at. Being there for others. Exploring life from their perspective. I picture myself as this big sun that is shining light into other people, and what I will bring to the world needs to have this into account. It is important that I’m able to realize that it is part of my gift, that it is what I bring, and to embody that into a reality. The project that I will build needs to have this into account. I’m trying my best to start from the ground, to erase everything that I have inside, to become empty, so that I can realize which are the next steps from there.

It makes sense to ask: What is it that I want to bring into the world? What is my purpose in life? For people to realize their true nature. It is a big thing to say, but it is true. I want to help people experience the truth of their being, and I’m in that journey since I started writing this book. And long before that also. I have been walking the path myself so that I can help others walk it afterwards. I’m here, paving the road, so that others can wake up afterwards. But how can I help others wake up if I’m not able to myself? How can I want to manifest that if it is not what is present in me right now as an experience of my beingness? Does it even make sense? I’m talking from a place of spiritual ego, and that’s why my forehead is going to explode. There is inside me all this willingness to realize my true nature, and that ends up conspiring with the process of doing it. I’m not even sure about this, but it is part of what is inside. Because it has been very hard. The trap of the mind is crazy. And it is for us to experience it. It is the road that I have decided for myself, and it is perfect as it is. Everything that I’m going through is part of the journey that I have embarked upon, and it is important to embrace it and love it and be with it. With everything that comes. It is just part of the journey.

A big part of what I want to do with the podcast listening to the album of the day is to honor my ancestors. They used to sit down to listen to music, and I have done all this work to deepen my meditation practice so that I can sit with more of what I am to do that same thing. I have emptied myself from the inside out so that I can experience what the music brings without any pre conception. Just with what is. Just with who I am, right there, in that moment. And it is very powerful. But I wonder, how does this help others? It is just me doing my thing. It is just me, sitting down in meditation, to listen to that album. How does that help others? Well, maybe there is another person in some part of the world that also likes doing that, or that wants to do something different. I decide to meditate through the album, maybe other person wants to do something different. For that, it is interesting to not share which the album is until after it was played, so that for the whole session the people don’t know what is being played. They just groove on it. They just experience it.

I have been doing this thing all the last months, writing, breathing, meditating, etc, to develop more clarity, and the least I can say right now is that there is clarity in me related to the next steps ahead. I don’t have a clue. There is a part of me that wants to start a startup, another part of me that wants to go and live to usa to go to the fit for service events and train with that community, another part of me wants to open up this small store in the downtown of my city and just groove on the creative process month after month. I truly don’t know what I’m going to do, but what is clear is that it is time for me to give energy to what I believe in. Why not witness the project that I used to apply to the Crypto Startup School? That one is The Open Source Factory, and it has a lot of power behind it. Because I showed up to work on it, day after day, for quite a long time. So there is a story behind it, and I’m exploring that story as I sit down to write about it now. I built a web application every month, and what ends up happening in there is that there is a lot of different applications that enhance the way on which I live. There is the radio, the deep work sessions timer, etc, and what I think I could do is to bring all of these below the same umbrella and help people to build cool projects on the internet. But do I really see me doing that? It is important for me to not forget the way on which I have been experiencing life the last years. I have been given full openness to do whatever I want, and in that space what I have done is to go deep into my own personal process, in this eternal quest of awakening that I’m at. How does this relate to leading other people in their journey of building web applications? Does that even make sense? I’m not sure about it. It doesn’t resonate much really. I mean, I think it is a cool idea, but I’m not sure if I want to build it into a reality.

Holy shit, I’m deep into the hole. I truly don’t know how to progress, where to move towards. I’m stuck in this void, with the willingness to bring something to the world but with a lack of understanding of what that is. And I wonder, what happens with the breathwork? Why not that? I am already in that path, I do it correctly, and I’m helping very nice people in their life. With this, I can end up generating an income to myself that can give me the opportunity to build something without time constraints, because I will be generating income on the side. What if I’m generating the income that I need for living with my breathwork sessions and I’m just using the deep work time to create amazing stuff? To unleash my creativity? And that’s the thing. That is what most resonates with me, unleash the creativity of people. That is part of why I’m here, to help people connect with that creativity that has always been there but they have forgotten. And with that, there can be a huge growth. And it is what resonates. I know that in 5 more minutes I’ll be writing about something different, but it is just what is present now. And that is what matters. Another hing that came to mind as I was witing this is that I wad not able to start this session by opening up the space, opening up myself to see what is going on inside, how do I feel with what I’m riting. So yes, this is a moment for that. It is a moment to acknowledge that there is sleepiness, that there is a feeling of anxiety, as if life was telling me: Just let go, but it is so hard. It is so hard to give up the control. Everything that I’m doing here is to have the control in my hand so that I can be in charge of it. And it is exhausting. That’s why I’m so tired. But I don’t know how to get out of it, you know? As I stare at the computer screen, my sight is blurry. I’m tired of all this thing, of all this wanting for things to be different, of all this effort that I have put for things to be different. I’m tired of the suffering. Dukkha is the biggest nightmare of them all. Day after day after day running around the tail of the cat, which is always much faster that I am. It is always this exploration into what is there when I’m not there, but it is a mental exploration. It is not an experiential exploration because I’m always here. I haven’t gone anywhere. And I’m the one that makes noise, the one that battles himself in the pursuit of excellence. I’m here, giving my best, and no one is listening. No one is telling me: Yes JP, you are doing it correctly.

And as soon as I wrote that, there was I. me a recognition that yesterday, as I was going through the process of learning how old my daughter is, I just realized that what I’m writing now doesn’t make any sense. Is it that I’m truing to make my brain, o mind, or whatever it is confused? Sit that I’m tired of the cosmic joke and I ended up just ranting with whatever comes to my mind and doesn’t make any sense? It is important, everything is important. Each moment of existence is important, every interaction is important. You never know which is the one that is going to transform your life, the one that will open the doors for the new future to arise, so just buckle up and let go. Nothing of what I just wrote makes sense, and it is ok like that. It is just me, letting go of the willingness to convey a message that ends up being something relevant to you. I gave up that mission, because I don’t have anything relevant to say. Every aspect of myself that is relevant is hidden right now, and what is talking is the aspect that feels that it needs to defend itself. There is this eternal willingness or need to defend myself, it comes from the gut, and by writing this I acknowledge the wisdom of it. It is what has brought us to this moment. It is the journey that I have taken to reach the here and now. Which is everything that I have, and everything that I will ever have. For you too. Everything that you have, everything that is real, is what is in front of your experience as a human being right now. Why so much sleepiness? That is part of my experience as a human being also. I’m here to acknowledge that, and feel how it feels. To be writing with my eyes closed and entering a place that needs for me to start typing slower, with more awareness of the decisions that I make. What ends up coming is part of those decisions. Each word that comes is a decision, that I’m working hard to eliminate myself from the middle and just let them come from my heart into the screen. I want to dissolve myself into the creative process, into the beingness of letting my truth to shine through what I’m manifesting here, and that’s why I’m putting so much effort to realize my true nature. So that I can bring more and more of that into it. So that I can become it. So that I can love it, and embrace it, and just experience how it feels.

That’s a theme that has come up a lot lately. To feel how it feels. That’s just the way on which I’ll be able to explore life completely, in this moment, right now. Feeling how it feels to be in my body. Experiencing every emotion and sensation that arise. Letting what comes, come, letting what goes, go. That’s me, hustling, pushing through. Which is the moment on which I decide that it is enough? That is something that truly characterizes me. I can’t stop. The exploration is just too interesting to stop. The end result is just too tempting for me to realize the truth yet. I can’t get there because I’m not ready yet, and I wonder: What do I need to do so that I can be ready? I need my master, my teacher.

The whole world is upside down, and I don’t see the way out. The one that makes more sense is not generalizing. My whole world is upside down, which is the way out of this maze? I have realized that the more I generalize, the less impact I can have in my own experience of reality. Each generalization is a willingness to change the perspective of other person, and that in and of itself is something that won’t have a direct impact. Because I cannot change them. What is going on at the level of the collective is just part of what is and it is important to be there so that I can embody my role in the part of it that accounts for myself. Which is, interestingly, just myself. That is the only impact that I can have. Just being, for others. Just experiencing what is. From my perspective, not wanting to change the collective in any way. This revolution won’t come from there. It will come from people joining forces and becoming more and more of what they already are in that exploration. It comes from us meeting each other, and witnessing. Just witnessing. Without taking it personally. Nothing is personal, things are just unfolding in front of me. Even my own process of awakening, it is not personal. It is not related to me. It is something bigger than myself, that is happening through me. A big part of me is curious about what this entails, and how to truly embody this not-caring-about-the-path-of-others. I mean, I care, but it is not my path to walk. I’m already ready to do that. That’s what I like saying, but then I’m at the trenches and I forget it. And the controlling aspect of myself starts showing up, and I being to have that willingness to change others. To bring some part of my experience into them so that they can realize a bit more of what they have always been.

That’s the thing, there is nothing that I can teach because I don’t have any clue about the place where I am at. After all what I have done I am more lost than ever, without the opportunity of grabbing the thing that I’m aiming towards and feeling lost because of that. It is so exhausting to desire something with all the heart and not be able to get there because the one that desires it needs to give up. So how can I navigate this paradox? It is probably the cosmic joke. The one that has been going on all this time. The funniest joke of them all, which speaks about out mind being just the expression of how crazy we are at the inside, and that eventually will end up being manifested in the outside world. In our outside world. And how is it manifested? With the people that are willing to be alongside us, in the good moments, in the bad ones. It is just part of what life entails, having the opportunity to walk with them. With the ones that care. That is the thing, I need to surround myself with people that truly care, so that I can anchor myself in the act of being alongside them. That is my mission. Just be. Just explore life from what being is. I just want to be. Every part of my being just wants to be, just wants to experience. I just want to be free, you know? Every inch of my being wants to be free, and everything that I have done is to walk the path towards that. I truly want to be free from any conditioning, so that I can experience life from the perspective of the present moment. So that I can embody everything that I have brought into this life as a gift that I share with others, in every moment, in every place. It is just the wonder of what being me is. I am this. I am experiencing life through what I am in this moment, and it is perfect like that. Why should I put such a burden on top of my shoulders? Is it really needed? I don’t think so. I’m over complicating things. It is way easier than that. Why not just start with the basics, and from there move on? I don’t need to rent the most fancy office in the world, I already have everything that it takes. I’m complete right now, and the one that wants to be in a hurry is the one that won’t let life live through me. I just want to let life live through me. It is just the experience that I’m having. It is just who I am right now. I don’t need to build the biggest startup of them all, I just need to explore how it feels to be me. How it feels to bring into the world what I want to bring. And with that, move on. Move on with more simplicity than before. Move on with more patience. Move on with the understanding that I already have everything that it takes, and that I’m here for the long run. Move on with the understanding that I’m already complete, that everything that I’m doing, in every moment, is just expressing a little bit more of what I already am. I’m here, I’m this, and in that understanding there is value. There is joy. There is a mission that I’m bringing into the world, and that mission is connected to the act of manifesting in my life the wonders of what it means to be alive. I’m here, exploring who I am, having you as a witness. I’m here to become free, and a big part of that is giving up all the complexity that is inside me so that I can just be. Who I already am. Who I came here to be. I’m here to enjoy, to embody my truth, to become it. To just experience how it feels to be me. To bring all of that into reality by allowing myself to manifest that truth.

And to also be able to manifest that complexity, you know? It is part of what I bring into the world. It is part of who I am. Which is the perfect life that I could live? What is the manifestation of it? Who am I when I’m living the perfect life? Myself. In every part of me. In every corner. I’m just myself, and I’m free from all of what I’m not. And what is it that I’m not? I’m not the doubts, I’m not the fear, I’m not the one that doesn’t understand how to progress. I’m the one that doesn’t care about it. I’m the one that just tries his best to navigate the waters of this understanding, so that he can explore more and more of what is already here. I’m here, exploring what is here. The infinite jest is the exploration of what has always been here. Depression, what an incredible concept, that I have not spoken about today. It is something that brings a lot of life to me. I truly think that at the other side of depression there is enlightenment. That is how humanity will become free of the burden of being something that the mind wants it to be. It is time to open up the heart, and my question is: How is that done? How can we open up the heart at a collective scale? Which is the means by which that happens? There is a way out, I know, but which is it? I can see my path in the last years and recognize in it an intense pursuit of freedom, but I have had the chance to walk this path because of all the gifts that life has given me. How can I deal with this in a different scale? How can I embody it in a different way?

I started writing this book as the manifesto of a project that I wanted to build but didn’t understand how. I’m here, still lost, without a clear understanding of how it will be done. Will it mix real life with the metaverse? Will I create transformational journeys for people to transform their relationship with themselves? How are those journeys organized? Which is what I bring into them? How are they designed? The hero’s journey is in my heart, I already built something related to that, and I’m here to help people make the effort that will help them become more of who they already are. How does human music and all that thing fit with what I’m trying to bring into life? How does this whole puzzle fit together? Which is the way out of the maze of my own mind?

Action. With intention. Opening to the world, and realizing which is the answer that it brings back. I’m here to explore that, to discover how the world reacts, and to see that I’m not alone. I’m not the only one. I’m here, just as lost as you are. We are all lost. It is a hard time to be alive, but it has always been. Life is a journey, the most amazing of them all. I’m here to explore it with everything that I have.
