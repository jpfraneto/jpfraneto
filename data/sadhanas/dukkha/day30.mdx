I write so that I can think. And this last 24 days have been very powerful for me. Yesterday Lex published a tweet sharing the last episode of his podcast with Ye, and I commented on it and got a lot of reactions. One comment had me take down the tweet because it was speaking about my intention of gathering attention by what I wrote. It is crazy to witness what is present in me right now with all of this. The tweet with which people have interacted the most of the ones that I have shared, and I take it down because I judge myself. I see myself as a person that is looking for attention because of the comment that that person shared, and I decide to take it down, after everything that it brought. There will always be haters that will push down everything I do, and rejoice on that. Will I be doubting how I show up because of this? It is the same as when I was doing the zoom call meditations, and that Russian hacker showed up. The internet is a crazy place, and it is up to me to decide how I will show up. Which is the truth with which I’m going to show up?

What if I engaged online thinking that everything will be in the blockchain? Am I not adding unnecessary complexity because of that? Why do I always want to add more complexity into what I do? It is part of what defines me. I feel good that way.

There is so much inside me related to the interview that I listened from Lex yesterday, and as I was listening to it I was just thinking what I would write about. And now I don’t even know what to write about, because I’m stuck with the hard feelings that this situation brought to me. WBut what can I learn about this whole thing? What did it bring into myself? A shitload of information. There is an amazing amount of information present as a consequence of showing up, and this is the moment on which I acknowledge that information and build up from it. Create this unconscious stream of words with the intention of making sense. Of what was brought up. Of having taken down that tweet. Of not trusting myself enough. There is a lot happening in me because of all this game that I have been playing, and it is very important for me to acknowledge it, and learn more of what I am through that process. Only that is how I’m going to be able to share my authenticity. That is the most valuable thing nowadays, authenticity, and it is time for me to be able to witness how that authenticity is explored in my own life.
What am I here to do? How am I going to show up? Which is the means by which I’m able to relate to the people that I want to relate to, so that I can discover more of who I am in the process? I just want to be able to explore the world, to be the person that sees himself in the eyes of others. How am I going to show up? Which is the one that shows up? It is time for me to do that. To explore. To witness.

Everything that I have been going through is an expression of who I am, and as I witness that, I become more of it. The fact that I took down that tweet is something that teaches me a lot, and it is important for me to gather all those learnings and evolve from there. It is done. I already did it. And nothing will happen because of it. I’m the only one that will miss it, because for the rest of the world it will never exist. I am the one that created it, and because of that, I am the one that gathers the attention towards this whole thing. But I don’t have to define myself with what was done, I just need to evolve from there. If I’m sharing my truth, should I take it down because of it not being received in a way that is conducent to me feeling good? And why is the focus only on the bad aspects of what I shared? Why do I focus only on that one comment that brought me down? If I’m not able to cope with this I won’t have success in this internet game. The internet is full. Of people that are going to bully me, always. But am I going to fall in to the trap?

Which is the trap? The one of my own mind. No one can harm me, no one can truly do anything to me or my family, it is just inside myself. In the value that I build for myself because of the image that other people create of me inside them. And in the moment that I let this tweet in, I let the miserable energy of that person in. I open up the room for that to happen. And what does come out from that opening? A lot of things inside. Humans doing their thing. Me being disappointed because of not having had only good responses. But the thing is that if you polarize, people will come. The world is polarization, it will always be present. If you put out something that a group of people will like, another group of people will probably dislike it. And it is important for me to develop the capacity for understanding how these mechanics work, so that I can transcend it and evolve from there. Do I really care about how people think? Do I really want to walk that path? That is the question that I need to ask myself every day, every time that I go in there and expose myself. Because that is what I’m doing, I’m exposing all of what I am so that everyone can come. Both the fans and the critics. Opening myself to the fans, I open myself to the critics. It is just the game that wants to be played.

How am I going to play it?

That is the big question. Probably today is one of the most important days in my twitter journey.

I’m here to develop that thick skin, and it is only done by exposing myself and showing up. And realizing that the person at the other side has suffering inside, and the way out of that suffering is just by sharing their shit with me. That guy Jakob has been the best teacher that I have had, and what he did for me has been the biggest learning that I have had in the month. And it happened because I shared my truth. Because I opened up and was certain that that was my truth. I just shared my truth, and the consequence of that was a reflection of it into the world. Some people may resonate with it, others won’t, but the important thing is just how I resonate with it. What is it that comes from that exploration.

Lex is the person that I admire the most in the world, because he has been able to stand up with everything that is happening and eventually add his own piece to it. He interviewed Ye when it was most needed, and it is not a coincidence that the video has had this amount of hype. He is constantly humble, and that is what the critics will never acknowledge. It is easy to yell from the steps. But another thing is to step into the arena and do his thing. Wholeheartedly. That’s why I believe in him, because he is willing to take the shit and help the advancement of humanity. It is about him opening the room for people to speak. That is what he is offering the world. A place where people can talk without a particular agenda. What a hard thing to do, open up that space and let it just exist. He is just a channel for this stuff to happen, and the moment on which I spend all this time and energy thinking about the tweet that I erased is all time and energy that I don’t spend actually thinking about what was shared in the conversation. And what it brought to me. The fact that I care so much about the reactions that my tweet had is the best expression of me being deep in my ego. And that is not helpful at all. The best that I can do is share what I am, share my truth, and mute all the reactions. What has happened in this last times commenting on Lex’s work is that people have reacted a lot to my comment, and it will keep happening. It is just what is. How will I choose to react to that commenting and to those reactions is in my domain of action, and if I want to make some progress it is important for me to acknowledge everything that was brought up. There is a deep need in me of acceptance, and that is why criticism is so hard to receive. It is easy for me to stay in my own bubble and don’t expose myself to the critics, but the important work is to go out and be in the arena. That is where the learning will come from. That is what will help me evolve.

Exposing myself by commenting to other people’s work. By engaging with it and growing with it. That is what needs to happen so that I can truly learn more about myself. This is the game that I’m learning to play, and just by exposing me and playing it I will grow. And twitter is the best place to do it, because it is where the shit is happening. There is no doubt about it. I just need to take care of myself and be strong into my beliefs, so that I can grow this thick skin. The invisible aspect of showing up is that only you know what has happened. Only you know where you are at, what you have seen, what you have felt. No one else knows. I am the one that knows what I have gone through. I am the one that can act from there. Which is the way on which I’m going to use my life experience in order to help others? What is it that I bring into this place that will make me valuable (for myself, and because of that, for others?). That is the game that I’m learning to play, every day, as I become more of what I am.

And the way on which I become more of what I am is by sharing my voice. Feeling that melting that I have inside when ego is challenged. Feeling that surrendering to the world, and realizing that it is just part of the journey. Realizing that it is the game that is played here. If I create, there will always be haters. That is part of it. It is just part of it. I cannot manage what happens. I truly can’t. What I can manage is how it impacts me, and what will come after that. And that is the true wealth of what is happening in me because of this whole game. That is it. Feeling the biggest imposter syndrome of them all, and realizing that it is the golden gem that life is offering me in this path of self-actualization. There is no other means by which I can evolve. It is just by being in the arena, and by sharing who I am in that process. Taking away the mask of all of what I’m not, so all of what I am can shine through. That is the gem. That is the magic.

As I become more and more open to what is out there, I enjoy more and more of what is in here. Inside me. Within me. Open up to that truth and shine. That is what I came here to do. To shine through my own fears. Of those fears of not being good enough. Of not being helpful enough. Of not being loved. Of not being intelligent enough. I have always surrounded me by people that make me feel intelligent so that my ego is exploding in joy because of being able to say stuff that makes me feel good. But in this thing that I’m building for myself, I have the opportunity to end that. To just disguise it into the magic of what comes at the other side.

What is it that I want to share into the world? That is the magic. That is the prize that is being offered through me. It is just important to witness what I have learned, and grow from there. I spend 108 days in a row teaching myself how to code without telling anyone. And I learned a shitload about what I’m capable of. It is time for me to realize the value that I bring into the world, so that I can act from there. So that I can truly trust myself towards that mission. How am I going to decide how to show up? Which are the bullets that I’m going to let in? Am I going to let any bullets in?

Nope. I’m not. But this is the training ground, and each day in the arena is an exploration into what can be.

Just by showing up and realizing what do I resonate with, and growing my profile from there. Growing my position, who I am, what I create. It is all part of the game, of the eternal game of showing up as how I am. Asking questions and interacting from a place of curiosity, of wonder. That is just what is needed, to apply all of what I have learned in my life so that I can empty myself from what is not useful, and be there for what truly is. And how will I be able to know what is useful if I don’t expose myself to that criticism? The internet is a whole new and different game, and the emotions that are brought up because of the interaction with what happens in there is completely new. Different.

How am I going to help people to mindfully interact with everything that is? By doing it myself. What comes from there is pure gold. There is nothing that has taught me more about myself than engaging with the people that I care about on Twitter. And being a witness of theconsqeuences of it. I feel kind of ashamed to write this, because in me there is a noise that tells me that it is not something ‘proper’. Or good. But yes, it is. And you know why? Because it is the truth. My truth. My own fucking truth. That is all that matters. That I don’t hide behind something that works as the means for me to hide anymore, because there is nothing to hide from. There is nothing there that can be harmful, because it is all inside your own mind. That is the game that we are playing now in the world, one of mind. And I have Done The Work to better learn how to deal with my own mind, and I’m doing it still. It is part of what it is. That is what I learn. That is where I learn from. Each thing that I do is a consequence of the path that I have walked, and it is time for me to embrace that so that I can grow. So that I can truly embody what it means to be me. Of every step that I have walked that has me in this moment writing these words. Feeling what is felt. Showing up and coming up with the ideas that determine who I can become. That is the magic. That is the mystery. The alchemy. Alchemy is what is brought when you realize the power that lies within, and the only way to walk that path is by actually showing up. The amount of words that come from me, the amount of wisdom that is distilled through my words is infinite. It is time for me to realize that and engage in it actively. Learn from every aspect of what I have come to realize af that who I am, and grow, and grow and grow by just showing up as myself. That is the game that I have been playing, peeling out the layers of who I’m not, so that I can better show up as myself.

Not as who I pretend to be by having a different life story than the one that I have had. Nope. That is not the game. The game is just showing up, with consistency, with focus. And that is all that it takes. Be focused and thrive. Why am I over complicating stuff, by wanting to build in web3 and this and that. That is the trick that my mind plays, thinking that there is something in me that needs to be learned so that I can do the thing. Nope, there is nothing that needs to be learned, the only thing that needs to happen is that I engage more with the people I care about, and through that, become more of myself. I discover who I am by interacting with people like you. This is my truth. I’m here to help you discover yours.

I’m discovering more of what I am by realizing what I’m not. That journey is the self-discovery that takes place as layers and layers of what I’m not get dissolved into that melting state, that melting feeling that is present every day. Probably it will always be there, just show up to experience it fully. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Just feel it. Just show up for yourself and embody everything that means to be a human being. Every aspect of it is a miracle, and right now we have the opportunity to reach out to people and discover more of ourselves in that process. This thing is a GAME! And it is important to learn how to play it so that I can get the most out of it. I’m realizing the value of everything that I have brought until this time. It is time to show that value to the world, so that more and more people can benefit from it. There is wealth inside me. There is something that wants to be exposed. And only by exposing myself I will be able to explore what it is.

I wanted to write about the conversation of Lex and Ye, but nothing like that came through. It is because I’m too embedded in my ego, of wanting to be witnessed, of wanting to be someone. It is time for me to just be, to just explore every second from the standpoint of someone that just is. I just am. That is the game that I’m playing. The one of gathering information from the world and using it on my own benefit. Who is the one that I will be in the future? A consequence of all what I have been in the past. I discover who I am by interacting with people like you, day by day. Moment after moment.

I deserve everything that happens, and I receive it with an open heart. I deserve all of what I am, and acknowledge every aspect of it. I’m grateful for the world and what it brings to me, because it is all part of the game that we are playing here. Gratitude to life. Gratitude to all of you.
