A questioning that has been present in this exploration is related to the name Dukkha. I started this project creating what would be a DAO for transformational journeys, for online meditation retreats, for people that want to Do The Work. The name Dukkha was brought into it because of what it brought into my awareness when I was in the last meditation retreat that I went. Eternal unsatisfactoriness. Always needing something different. Always wanting something more. Why would a project which’s aim is the complete opposite be named like that? And that is the questioning that has been inside me all this time. What is present inside me when I think about this project, when I write about it? Is it Dukkha? Is it this project the means by which I help the world get out of Dukkha?

And the answer that comes more and more is related to what this book is. It is an absolute expression of the maze of my own mind. Of how Dukkha is expressed through me. The only way in is through, and what is happening in this book is me going through. Me deep in Dukkha. Each part of my being sunk in that way of existing, that willingness to get somewhere but not being able to. That willingness to go a little bit deeper but not being able, because it is not clear where to go. The last days I have been running in circles in this aspect, not being able to find the time to sit down and write what is going on. And what happens is very particular, because if I don’t do it I miss what will come up in that moment. It is not that there will be something not said, it is that an aspect of my life story will not be translated into this paper. And there is a huge loss in that, because that aspect is all of who I am. In that moment. This last week I have not been able to sit down to write whatever comes up, and in that, I miss that aspect of my whole process of diving deep into the waters of Dukkha. Of my own mind. Of the maze of my own mind. I keep running around in circles, but if I’m able to come here and write about it, at least it will stay out of my mind and in the domain of public knowledge forever. And that is the powerful part of being able to come here and write whatever comes up. It gets stuck in this paper. It is permanently written down here, as the testament of what I went through to realize more of what I already am. If I don’t Do The Work, I miss part of myself in the void of everything that went by and was not recorded.

And most of the history of humanity is like that. Most of us will leave this world without a creation that will be the means by which history will remember us. Most of humanity works for a third party, which is not related to their own story, and in that, their own story gets lost. Of course the impact that you have in the story of that particular thing is important, but what is what you are going to get out from that? What is your legacy? What are you leaving behind in the world?

And that is why the creative process is so important. Giving yourself time to sit down and transform into something concrete all of what you are in that moment, without caring if it is good or not. Just doing it for the sake of it. It has an aspect of transcendence, because it is what will remain from what you do. How are you going to open yourself to that?

That is what comes as a learning process from what was experienced by me the last week. Before it, I had a consistent practice of coming here and writing, which was lost because of being in another place, with other people, doing other things. I was not able to get into the flow of what I had to do, and that did not help me to become more of myself by sharing my truth with this blank page. My truth got stuck inside me, as I did not give space for it to come through in my creative act. And because of being stuck, I ended up with patterns of behavior that are different from those which I’m used to. And the consequence of that is that I was out of my center, navigating the experiences that I lived from there. But what if being out of my center is truly being in my center? What if the way on which I explore life more clearly is by just throwing myself out there and being a witness of how I react to it?

I remember a therapy that I went, on which I had to choose a shape of feet that represented me. There were lots of couples of shapes, and there was only one that was one feet. That was the one that called me. The one that was alone. The unstable one. That’s what I came here to do, throw me into the uncomfortable and be a witness of how I react to it. That is the interesting part of this whole process, to be an explorer of how I react when I put at good use my chameleon like ways of being. I love being in different places, with different people, doing different things, and witness how I react to them. I’m not attached to any of them. I can eat all the pizza in the world, drink all the beer in the world, do all the drugs in the world, but not be attached to any of it. I go into the extreme, but it is not hard for me to come back. But I truly go all in. And that is an aspect of myself that is very important, and that I have a hard time understanding completely how it can be in service to the world. What is what I’m learning from myself by being part of completely different experiences? There is a lot of value on that.

If you are able to go into a course on blockchain, and after it go into a course on web design, and then go into a course on ecology, and then go into a course in woodworking, the way on which your brain has to adapt to all of that is powerful. It is intense, and powerful. And I’m like that, I have always been, and it is time for me to realize it, embrace it, and live from there. And also give me the space to come here and document the process, because that is where the real value comes from. Being able to process what has happened and give me the space to integrate it. Yesterday I read a piece about integration, and how much of a buzzword it is in the life of most people that do the things that I do.

You go to a transformational festival and then you have to integrate what you experienced. How do you do that?
You go into a meditation retreat and then you have to integrate what you experienced. How do you do that?
You go to a concert that changes your life and then you have to integrated what you experienced. How do you do that?

By allowing yourself to create from the heart. That is the answer that always comes. The ultimate aim of all of those experiences is to help us move a little bit closer towards the understanding of how to live more in the present. That is the ultimate goal that we should all strive for: How to live more in the present. How to be present. And that should be all what integration is about. How to be more present after the experience that you lived. Because if you go back to ‘normal life’ and start craving the sensations that you lived in the special event, you are living in the past. The event itself is doing something different than what it should do, it is bringing you out of the present. So how can you do that integration? How can you do more of it so that it can be transformed into the way on which you approach daily life? That is the goal. How can every aspect of our being be integrated so that everything that we live can be used as the means for living more present?

By creating something that did not exist before. I keep coming back to creativity, because it is the answer that my heart gives me. Every day. Create, and your presence will shine from there. In the act of creation that is done with intention, presence comes through. That is the key of it. The intention. It doesn’t matter for how long it is done. The important part is the intention. You may seat down to write for 4 minutes every day for 21 days. That’s it. But the important thing is for you to bring everything that you are to those 4 minutes, each time you do it. At first it will be hard, but if you are consistent with it, something will start happening. There will be a change that will come through. And that is everything that you need in order to bring forth that transformation. Those 4 minutes of pure presence will start to permeate the rest of your actions, until the doer is dissolved in the action itself. How would the world look like if we all acted from a place of presence, in each of our actions? What would we work on? Which are the jobs that are going to become obsolete and that make people have to do things that don’t require of their presence?

I’m thinking about yesterday, when we came through a toll station in the highway and there was a woman in there singing out loud. You can choose to do that job with a good mood or with a bad one, but most of the times the latter will win, because it is something absolutely mechanical, which doesn’t require any aspect of that person being fully present to what is being done. Sure, calculate how much you have to give back as change, but not to much more than that. How will the world look like when all of these jobs are replaced by a robot? What will happen with all those human hours that will be freed from these mechanical jobs? What are they going to be invested in? That is the big question that I’m trying to answer with this writing, because I truly think that it is doing something creative. Creating. Nowadays we are so used to consume that this is something that doesn’t even cross our minds. How can we create if we don’t have time to do it? But people don’t realize how much they spend just consuming. Every series that you watch in Netflix is you consuming content. Every post that you witness in Social Media is time that you are consuming. And when you only consume, there is no aspect of yourself that is challenged. Sure, you can choose to take some action related to that consumption (like, comment, share, etc), but this is not something mandatory that comes from the consumption. Nope. It is a decision that you have to make, and one that is commonly done passively. Most of us don’t like to expose ourselves, and being behind the transparent window of our own phone is the great escape for being exposed.

But when you create you will be exposed. You will be challenged. You will have to face your own demons. And you will grow because of that. The act of bringing out something from your own mind into the world which other people can relate with is the biggest gift that you can do to yourself, but at the same time, one of the most challenging ones. You need to be open to that transformation. One thing is to go to a transformational event (Burning Man, Vipassana, etc) and another thing is to embody what was brought into your existence after that experience by acting upon the wisdom that was present in those times. How to bring more of that wisdom into every day actions? That is the game that we are learning to play here. Bringing us more and more into the present, by doing stuff that are intended for that. It can be meditation, it can be creating something, it can be breathing. Whatever practice that is designed for anchoring your consciousness into the present works as the means for doing this transition, for moving from time to timelessness.

What helps you disconnect from the existence of time? Bring more of that into your life. Explore what happens in your whole being when more of that is present in what you do. It is the exploration that comes. It is where we are heading to. How would the world look like if more and more of us lived in the present moment?

Or just if we collectively moved towards that. It can just be an aiming. A moving towards. That is where the transformation starts happening.

How do you see the world in the future? Which are going to be the activities on which we are going to spend our time? It is interesting to witness how we are evolving, and what is going on every day. For example, yesterday I found an app on which you write and it creates a movie with what you write. How does the world look like when each of us has the capacity to build something like that from scratch? That is what AI is bringing to us. It is helping each of us to become a creative, without the boundaries that we had before of having to be in a certain level so that you can share what you do. The field is getting more balanced, and the only thing that will remain present is that for you one hour is the same as for me. We may have a perceived difference in the exploration of time, but the present moment will be the same for each of us. And what comes from that realization? Until now, there is people that their time is more valuable in the economy than others. For example, if you are the CEO of a big company the amount of money that an unit of time of yours is worth is much bigger than if you are a gardener. But what happens if we create a means by which this is not true anymore? How would the world look like if we had a levelling field on which at least for 8 minutes every day the time of each of us would be the same? We all breathe, we all have particular aspects of our beings that are normal, and we can encounter each other human being in that common ground. How does that feel? What if those 8 minutes where the transformation that the world needs? What if those 8 minutes are the levelling ground on which we bring more presence into our life by just opening up to the possibility of connecting with whoever is at the other side, without the judgement of that person being superior or inferior? What if for those 8 minutes all of the labels were dropped, and we encountered each other just with what we are in that moment? Tell me who you are. That is the inquiry. Tell me who you are, for 4 minutes, as I listen absolutely present to what you say. And then it is my turn. I will tell you who I am. And that is the game. That is all what it takes. Just 4 minutes of inquiry. Of being fully present to the human being that is at the other side. Tell me who you are, and I’ll tell you too. What is at the other side? Who is at the other side? I am. The depth of who I am is witnessing myself from the other side. If I watch another person’s video, I open the possibility to record myself doing it. That is all what is needed. 4 minutes of being the witness, so that I can give you what I am. Tell me who you are. I’m here for you. And it can start as me, talking to the phone, just being who I am. Every day. And if I forget, it doesn’t matter, I can come back again tomorrow. But if I come with my truth I’m giving me the permission to offer it to who is at the other side. And that is the valuable thing.

It is the same that happened to me this last week. I did not come here to write, and I missed what would come through. Am I a worse person because of that? Nope. But I didn’t Do The Work, and it is in me. I am the one that did not open the door for that transformation to happen. If this app exists and I don’t go in there for my 8 minutes that day, I am the one that misses the opportunity for being there for the other person. Dime quien eres. Open up to what comes from that exploration. Give me all of what you’ve got, for only that time. Show up for yourself, and share everything that you have been in the process. Explore what comes. The interesting part of what is going on in the world right now is that we are reaching a point on which we can translate what is being said, and it can be said in our own language. So you can choose. You listen to the language of the other person, or you listen in your own one. It is your choice. But you can only do it once. And it will be lost. There won’t be any information to what the person is about, there won’t be any track. The only thing that happens in this, the simplest app of them all, is that you come in and listen to another person, and then you talk. And then another person will listen to what you say, and the chain will continue on and on. There only needs to be one person that starts the chain and from there it will flow. And each day every video will be destroyed. This is going to be the most valuable asset in the history of humanity, because it will speak to the truth of what we all are. There won’t be anything more important than this in the future. As computers get more and more sophisticated, they will be able to generate this conversations on the go. And the videos that will be recorded from now until that point are the ones that will have the information of how humans look like when they speak their truth. And with these videos, we will be able to gather the information of what a human being truly is.

Tell me who you are.

Dime quién eres.

That is the most basic prompt of them all, but if you consistently dive into the consequences of feeling it there will be a transformation that will take place within yourself. That is the game that this app will play. What happens if you open up to that truth. What is at the other side of witnessing that truth. Consciousness being conscious of itself. It doesn’t need to be good. It can’t be bad. It just can be. And it is the most simple UI and UX of them all. You come in, you see one person doing its thing, and you do yours. That is the game. That is what comes. What happens from this exploration will happen outside. And it will be donation based. There will be a bitcoin address which will receive what people want to donate, and with that, it will go on existing. It is as simple as this. The highest amount of traffic that will happen is the person receiving one video, and then sending one. And as soon as one video is seen, it will be deleted from the network. And with this it will keep running. No video will be seen twice. You can’t choose what video you will see. It will be an absolutely random process, with people from all over the world, asynchronous and conscious. The only amount of time that you are able to use the app is 8 minutes every day. That is all. You open it, download the video, watch it with all your attention, and then record yours. That is all what it takes. Then yours is sent to the cloud, and you will be notified when a new day starts. And we will keep like this, until eternity, until all of humanity is part of it. You won’t be drained of your energy, it is impossible, because all of the time that you use it will be consistent every day. What happens now with social media is that the amount of time that you use them is directly related to the amount of value that they are able to extract from you. What if this is capped to a maximum? How would your interaction with Twitter look like if you had only 30 minutes of usage every day? What word would define that interaction?

INTENTION.

--

The world that I’m opening here with my writing is the one of the ideas that are deeply rooted in my whole being. I’m writing this book as the means for integrating all the experiences that I have gone through, so that I can clarify clearly where I’m heading to. What I’m going to give my energy to. That is the key of this whole thing. And the idea that just came through is very powerful, because I can build it the same as Human Music, which is a radio that works 24/7 even if there is no one going in there and exploring what comes. I built it for that. And the idea that I just consolidated related to Tell Me Who You Are is the same. I can be the only one recording those videos until the end of my life. It doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is that I stay consistent, and with that, things will start happening. There is no better meditation than being truly present for another human being, and as soon as people realize that there will be traction in the app. The only thing that I need to truly take care of is to build it in a way that is solid, resistant. Because, what happens if there is a lot of traction and I don’t know how to react to that traction? What happens if it is shut down because of that traction? It will need to be strong, powerful, so that I can have it up and running always. That is probably my mission after I end up this book. But yes, that is me also going to the future, taking everything that I am right now and jumping to the future to build up something that is not existent yet. That is a big part of who I am. The one that jumps into the future and is building in there, instead of being here.

It is funny, because I’m writing that, so it means that I’m here, right now. It feels like I have one feet in the future, and another one here. Can you realize how much of a mess this is? That’s why I’m writing this book, so that I can truly be a witness of how much a mess this whole thing is. The mind. I’m completely open about how crazy I am. I can’t hide it. There is an absolute impossibility for me to hide it, because each time that I come here to write my craziness shines through everything that I say. Jumping from one place to another. From this moment to the future. But I wonder: Is it that I’m writing in this moment and I’m being on the future? Or the fact that I’m doing this is a representation of me being in the present, just dreaming about something that is not real yet? Yes… That is something that comes to my mind a lot. Where does thinking lie in this whole process of being present? If I’m not my thoughts, and each time that I go with one thought I go away from the present moment, how can I think? Which is the proper process of thinking? How should I think?

And that’s why this book is called ‘The End Of Shoulds’. As if there was a particular way of thinking. What a nonsense. How could there be a particular way of thinking. See, that is how much I love being in control of what happens in my domain of action. I even think that there is a specific way of thinking that is better than another one. That is the mind playing its game. Building an artificial separation in my domain of action. In my life. In what is happening in front of me. Trying to find the ‘optimal way of thinking’, so that I can get the most out of life. How can that be a reality? How can there be a ‘good’ way of thinking and a ‘bad’ one? I just am. I just explore. Let that exploration come forth, and witness it with awe and curiosity. That is what good thinking is about, just letting it be. Just going with it and realizing that it is good as it is.

It is quite nice to assume that I’m crazy. It feels freeing. It feels good. Witnessing myself write these words and realizing how crazy I am that I’m talking to myself in this way. That maybe no one will ever read this, and it is ok like that. Because I will read it. It is the most important thing that I have done in my life, to express the truth of who I am by exploring what comes when I sit down and empty myself into this words. Into the exploration. Into the void. It doesn’t matter how good it is, it doesn’t matter which is the content, it doesn’t matter how it feels. It matters that it feels. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Let what comes come, and just feel it. Be there for it. Witness it and explore what is at the other side.

The way on which the world is unfolding is just amazing. Everything everywhere all at once. It is happening, and it has been happening since the dawn of time. But we are getting to the point on which more and more of us are able to realize that we are here. We are just being. That is the important part. That we are. And it is the one that is harder to manifest as a solid understanding in one’s own existence, because it is taken for granted. Most of us take life for granted. Each breath is granted. Of course we are going to take that next breath. How couldn’t we, it is part of who we are. It is part of who we have always been. But what happens when that breath is not there anymore? What remains when you stop breathing? What remains when you are not there anymore?

That’s one of the koans that stuck deep: You minus you. That’s all what is.

Who are you when you are not you anymore? What are you? What remains?

That is the exploration that comes forth as you come here and do the work of being the witness of another human being doing his or her thing. That is the exploration of the unknown, and it is one of the key aspects of what I spoke about before. With the technology that is in place now, we can do it. I can assure that the person that is at the other side of the screen records him or herself in a way that is appropriate for the whole game, and that will make everything work as a clock. Holy shit, I really want to bring this into existence. It feels like the most important work that I can do. The self inquiry app. The dyads. Tell me who you are in a global level, with automatic translation made by an AI model that will be developed open source. That is the ultimate open source project, being able to translate what is being said in real time. Actually, this whole app needs to be open source. And hosted in the blockchain. Is it possible that it is hosted in the blockchain? How can a video be hosted in the blockchain? It will be very important to be able to compress the information so that it can be transferred efficiently. I’m excited with the idea, really. It has a lot of potential, I’m sure about that.

And I’m also excited about this place that I have built for myself as the playground. Life has given me the opportunity to play, to share with you what is inside me, to distill each part of my being into the words that come up. Be open with them. Be ok with what is. Life has given me the opportunity to trust in me enough so that I can just be with what I am right now. And it truly feels good. It doesn’t matter what ends up happening, it just matters that it is. It just matters that I show up and continue to do my best. This will be what remains. These words are going to be my legacy, the way on which I have spoken from the heart. What I’m learning how to do here is to eliminate the mediation from my mind in the creative process, and that is something that I open day by day. And if I’m drunk, I need to come here, so that that drunkness can be expressed into what I write. It is part of who I am, and it will be important to be a witness of it. How is my writing when I’m drunk? How does it look like when I’m high? How does it look like when I take mushrooms? Those are all ways on which I can better explore who I am, because all of those changes are in the level of mind. If I’m drunk, it is in the level of mind, in the level of the interface on which I relate to the world. But awareness is just aware. It is just there, in the background, being a witness of what is going on. So what happens if I just open myself to be that witness? If I explore what is in there? That’s where true freedom comes from. That is the true end of shoulds. It is not about giving up drinking, or taking drugs, or whatever. It is not about doing X or Y. It is about exploring what remains when all of those things are present as an activity of the mind. It is about exploring what is the underlying presence that is constant as all those changes are happening at the level of mind. Only there is where Dukkha ends, when there are no more judgements related to the actions that are taken.

Another way of talking about the end of shoulds is talking about the end of judgements. What remains when there are no judgements anymore? When I truly accept every aspect of my being as a consequence of all of who I am?

Freedom to be. What I decide to be. Freedom to create, what I decide to create, without the boundaries that are imposed by the creation having to be something particularly ‘good’. It is crazy to see that most of our judgements come from the place of being that does not accept all of what we are. I saw that clearly in a meditation retreat, on which there was a noble silence restriction imposed, and in each sitting at the dining table I saw myself judging all of what the other people were putting into their plates. And suddenly I realized that I was just judging myself, because I could not accept the way on which I brought stuff into my plate. Through the judgment that I was imposing on others, I was just judging myself. And that is true for every judgement that comes from the mind, because they are all related to aspects of yourself that are not resolved. That I don’t accept inside me. So how can I truly be free if I am the one that judges himself? If I am the one that feels that is not worthy of what can happen to him? That’s why the biggest work that you can do is internal, because all of the shit that you have inside ends up being manifested in the way on which you relate to the outside. Those are the consequences of it. Judgement. Separation. If I judge myself through the judgement that I feel related to the way on which you behave, there is a strong aspect of separation between me and the reality that is present in front of my experience. And I can’t be free if that is going on. So the best I can do is just work on myself so that I can integrate all these aspects of myself that I judge, so that I can understand where do they come from.

What is wrong with my relationship with food that I judge?
What is wrong with my relationship with others that I judge?
What is wrong with my relationship with myself that I judge?

These are all questions that can bring me deeper into the exploration of who I can be, or better said, who I already am. All these aspects of separation that are present and that make me judge me and feel separated from the truth of what is being expressed through my actions are information, the most valuable information that I can use as the means for better understand embody my experience as a human being. There is nothing to be understood, because all understanding comes from the level of mind. This needs to be felt, truly integrated from the depth of who I am. Only through that I will be able to become free of the burden of having to be someone different from who I already am. If I drink that beer, it is ok, it is just the expression of who I’m being in that moment, one that needs that satisfaction, or connection, or numbness, to make some kind of progress in his life. If I take drugs, it is just more of what needs to happen in my life so that I can become more of myself. If I’m not able to come here and write, it is just what needs to happen so that I can go through what comes at the other side. It is not about being a passive ameba in the world, it is the complete opposite. It is just to truly feel everything that is present, and with that, move towards a better embodiment of all what is present in my experience as a human being.

The word integration came up again, and a wondering of which is the relationship between the process of integration and this acceptance. What is the relationship between the words integration and judgement? What comes is related to what is experienced in a transformational event. Most of the times, something different from what is present in daily life goes on there. And there is a judgement when coming back, related to your life not being as attuned to that special experience as it should be. That is a big judgement that happens. I’m not good enough at this game of life because I still have the problems that make me feel the kind of separation that is felt when I come back from Burning Man. How can’t I relate to my co-workers the same as I did during that week in the dust? Why are these feelings present in myself as I come back to normal life? There is a constant judgement that is expressed by all those thoughts about how life ‘should’ be and it is not. And that is what the integration is about. The most important aspect of it is related to accepting that it is not, and moving forward with the knowledge that it just is. You don’t relate to your coworkers as you would like, because it is not only in your control. We humans are dynamic forces of nature, and you can’t expect that because you came with a particular energy from a particular event everyone will be at that same frequency. The more you realize that you can’t control the experience of other human beings, the smoother this integration process will be. Because there will be a deep realization that it is not the work that you have to do. The end of shoulds is also realizing that it is not your work to change anyone. No one should be as you expect them to be, that is just your ego wanting to be the savior of the world. Perharps that is the biggest consequence of all that has been written in this book. It is not my job to change anyone, and in the moment on which I’m able to truly embody that I will become free.

And with freedom comes the ability to truly enjoy every aspect of how life force is expressed through each human being that is alive. Yes. That is the consequence of freedom. Acceptance. To what is. To all of those who already are what they came here to be. And have always been. It is just the mind playing its separation game, its game of wanting to be more, of wanting to control, of wanting things to be different, of wanting to know more, to learn more, to live more, to bring more out of life. To bring the most out of it. But the only way on which that is going to be a reality is by just embodying what comes when there is acceptance of what is. And that acceptance truly comes from within, from the understanding that I am perfect as I am right now. That there is nothing that should be changed in my experience as a human being right now, because all of that which is thought that needs to be changed is just that, a thought. And thoughts come and go. They are not what determines the expression in reality of who I am. I seem to be a verb, not the thoughts that go on the back of that verb. I seem to be something that is not static. I seem to be moving. I seem to be something that is always changing, always becoming. I just seem to be, and every aspect of myself that tryies to build a different reality from that is the mind, it is all of what I’m not. I seem to just be, and it feels good that way. It feels like freedom. It feels like the pure expression of what I came here to be, and it feels that that is they way towards the end of suffering. The only way in is through, and the only way of going out of the maze is having fun inside it.

Embody each aspect of myself that the maze shows me.
Embody each piece of the puzzle that is brought up.
Embody the dark aspects, and the light ones. They all constitute the integrity and richness of this experience.
Embody the lazy one, the disciplined one.
Embody what comes when I give up, and when those sensations of not being enough arise.
Embody the one that feels anger, because all of that anger is an expression of who you are not.
Embody all the sensations that are felt in the body. They are the purest information that you can get.
Embody everything that you are, and everything that you have been. It is a miracle, and every breath you take is a gift.

The only way in is through, and I’m done with the suffering. I’m done with Dukkha, and the only way out of it, is by exploring how every aspect of myself feels by being completely immersed in it.
