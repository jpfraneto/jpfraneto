This book is about Doing The Work. It is a testament that I want to bring into existence as a consequence of having done it myself. It is brutal. I just ended my morning meditation after waking up at 4:44 am, meditating for 1 hour which was eternal because very tough stuff is coming up during it and it makes it hard to go through, and no one is there for telling me ‘congratulations, you did it again’. In this world we are used to getting feedback from it, which makes us feel good. We are used to receive praise, or any kind of external consequence for what we do, but in this kind of game there won’t be something like that. You have to show up for yourself, and it can get quite challenging not to have that external validation. If you don’t validate it internally, how can you keep it up? I guess that my take on that is that this is the point where faith comes in. And maybe faith is another way to speak about that internal fire which moves us towards the unknown. There is something within me that is craving for the exploration of the unknown, there is part of me that _knows_, and that is the part that doesn’t need external reassurance, because it is everything that is. The part of me that calls for The Work is the consequence of it. That part helps me do it, because it knows that the consequence of it is fundamentally different from whatever external validation I could get in 48 lifetimes. There is a knowledge within, which pursues this thing and helps me go through it without needing someone to be next to me telling me: ‘You are doing it right boy, keep it going’. At the end of the day we are alone in this thing, and no one can do The Work for you. That is what you signed up for when you started reading this thing. Just sit. Just sit and ask yourself ‘Who am I?’ Until there is no one asking. Just do The Work.

Dukkha is being created to join forces in this quest. I do it on my own because I’m alone, I don’t know enough people, nor have a proper job, on which I can do this kind of thing and be alongside with other people that are aiming to do it. A big part of me wants to belong, to be part of a collective of human beings that are aiming towards the same thing, that are seekers who know the thing and are willing to annihilate themselves in order to experience the truth. I was sitting down and one of the rants on which my mind went today was: ‘So here I am, learning how to die before I die, on my own house, and no one really knows I’m doing this. No one really understands what I’m going through. I can have a major breakthrough in my meditation, something that can transform the way on which I relate to reality, and my wife and baby will wake up the same as every other day, with the same smile, as if it was all how it has been always’. It’s tough to reconcile that. A big part of me wants them to know, wants them to realize how hard I have worked to become a more conscious, loving and clear human being. But the sole fact that I wrote that sentence is part of the root of the thing, because on that trying hard I get lost in it, forgetting to just be.
I say ‘I have worked hard to become…’ and that is the whole thing that summarizes what I will talk in this book. The thing is aiming to become. Trying to change something that is already there, and will always be there. I can’t become anything, I’m already it, but I’m not able to realize it because of this eternal wanting, trying, aiming to become. I’m always standing in a point and looking to other one, because I feel deeply inside that there is something that needs to be changed. And that won’t let me live in the present, and that won’t let me truly appreciate every moment that goes by.

Everything that I do is for myself, and writing it down here is a means for establishing it as a testament deep within myself. Everything that I do is for myself, because I am the one that wants to know the truth, and experience life from there. I am the one that is tired of suffering because of Dukkha, and it is on me. I am the one that is willing to Do The Work, to pave the road, because I know. If I do it and then everyone feels the same, that is a window to rejoice in the fact that I do it for me. For me to have a clearer perception of who they are, and enjoy every aspect of their being because of that. It is for me, for having a deeper enjoyment of life. I do it for me, and its not fair for anyone that I think of her different because she hasn’t done it. I do it for me, because I am the one that wants to experience the truth. I do it for me, because I am the one that wants to feel the deepest love that has ever been felt. I do it for me, because I care. Because I love life so much that I want to learn how to let it go. How to break free from the attachments from it. Because this is the most important Work that can be done in a lifetime, and it is time to wake up. It is time to realize the true nature of my being, and for that, no one will be there cheering me up, pushing my ass till the top of the hill. Nope, this is a game that is played by oneself alone, it is a quest on which each of us embarks only with the image that comes back from the mirror. No partners here, I’m so sorry. No one to assess you progress more than you, I’m so sorry. Just you and the look in your eyes. Just you and the consequence of each one of your senses inside you. Just you and your memories, and each conditioning that is part of _your_ particular existence. No one can be in your shoes. Never.

You can spend a whole lifetime trying to explain who you are, who you have been, what do you want to become, but you will never be able to convey it clearer than just by being. That is everything that you are, and it shows up when you are just being. That is the amazing part of this whole game… The more you understand, the more you have to give up doing something particular. Becoming absolutely free is understanding on a experiential level that there is nothing to be done. We are here just to be. We came just to be. You are the only one that knows. You are the shadow that has been following you the whole time. No one can acknowledge that for you. You have to realize it for yourself. You are the one that will wake up. Not me. I can’t do it for you. And the best way on which I can embody everything that I have learned or experienced is by evolving the way on which I relate to the world. Evolving who I am, just by being the way I am. Just expressing from that place of truth. Of my truth. Every one of us has its own truth, and it is time to fully live that reality. Fully accept it. The other day there was an old person waiting for the bus and we took him to the town, and he started talking to us about how god had changed his life, after presenting himself to this person on a turning point of his life, after being a deep alcoholic for 15 years. That moment absolutely changed his life, and he was talking to us about his relationship with god and all what it meant in his life. Every second of his existence was devoted to god. How can I bring my truth into this story and try to change in any way his perception so that he can understand that he IS god. It is not my job, not my duty, and it is perfect as it is. It is perfect. Every deviation from that perfection is a construct of my ego trying to help people when they don’t need help.

That is such a constant one, wanting to help when I have not been asked to. It is another expression of what I was talking before, because it is the means by which I impose my truth in front of other person’s truth. I think that mine is more true because I have ‘Done The Work’. How qualified am I to say that my work is more important than the one that all the rest of humans have done? I’m no one. It is not something good to do, and here I am acknowledging that and making a little bit more conscious so that I can better understand why, and bring it into the conscious aspect of my being. Because this is a big one. When I was traveling the world, I used to to different places, with different languages, and the first thing that I asked locals how to say in their language was ‘Do you need help?’. That is me, always willing to help. But which is the limit to that? When does it become something that is not helpful because I’m trying to express an unconscious belief that they need my help because they haven’t done The Work?

That is a great thing about social media right now, the cat that I can post my work openly, and with that, not have to talk directly to one person, and try to change that particular person. No, now I can share it for all of those who want to listen, and not try to change someone particular. Offer the possibility for change to happen, but just for those that want it and will approach. That is an amazing thing of this day and age, being able to do that. I guess it is my responsibility to build up my audience and the people with which I want to work with, because those are the ones that will give me energy and make me feel alive. It is easy for me to underestimate the power that twitter followers can have, but it is major. It is something that is beyond what I think. And it is my duty to be able to share my voice with those that want to listen, and that’s what I’m doing every day by coming here and just sharing it. And going to twitter and just sharing my thoughts. It is an amazing part of Doing The Work, sharing your stuff openly, and realize that the world doesn’t end if it good enough. It is so easy to under appreciate the work that has been done to reach this understanding, but it doesn’t really matter. What only matters is the work itself, each time that is being done.

Today I have my first breathwork session, actually the first online session that I have planed and that I have charged for, and it is a major day in my life. Most of it it has been very hard for me to establish a healthy relationship with money, most of it lately in my life, because of two things:

1. I have been given a lot of wealth because of having been born where I was born.
2. It is very hard for me to value what I do enough so that I can charge for it.

So today is a day on which that transitions into something new, because I open up to the possibility of sharing myself with the world. I have been doing it lately, having a different personality in every social media thing, and it is so amazing, I feel so happy and inspired by being that chamaleon that does something different in each one of them. I feel good with it, and creating this breathwork salon today is an expression of that also. I’m giving myself the space for being there for other people. I was just going to write that I was going to help them, but that is not true. I will just hold the space, and they will help themselves, each on her on way. As I said before, the most important part of this whole game is showing up, and this people will do it. Each of the persons that will be part of this thing will show up, and that is the most important aspect of Doing The Work. Showing up. The saying goes: ‘The most important way on which you can help yourself is to learn how to do things when you don’t feel like doing it’. That is the same. The biggest transformations happen when you show up, just because you care. Just because you want to explore what will happen at the other side. Show up. Be there. For you, not for anyone else. You deserve it.

Who am I?

The one that plays the music. The one that feels the music, in the bottom of the flesh. The one that is running the flesh, bringing into life stuff, a lot of stuff in the meantime. I am the clarity that is present when there is not a noise of something that I should be. I’m not what I should be, I am what I am. That’s all. I am the one that is willing to create something new, and see what happens. I am the one that sees off people show up, that realizes if people are willing to show up by creating the space. I am the one that has a hard time sharing his voice, because it doesn’t come across. I am not the one that expects something particular to happen, I am the one that just lets it happen. I am the holding of the space, because I am space itself. How wouldn’t I be able to hold space if I’m space itself! The shivers in my body, the cold that is more present than below the cold shower.
All that trying to answer the question who I am rationally. I’m not that. I can only tell what is present right now, and that is a feeling of awkwardness for not having anyone show up in the salon. There is disappointment present, but also a recognition that the work needs to be refined. I have not done my due diligence properly, and I need to level up my game. The way on which I have been communicating is good, I have good ideas and everything, but it is time to level up the game. I need to become unstoppable, and transform all of who I am into value that can be the means by which I do my thing every day. I want to transform the world, and the way into that is understanding how to play the game. The ones that matter understood how to play the game, and it is in that that I will make my way through. I am the one that just wants to play that game, and is learning how to do it.

I am the one that feels melted when no one shows up, and realizes that that is the game that I have been playing. I am the one that is need for putting the feet in the floor, so that I can run truly. I’ll start running. I’m beginning to run, just by showing up to Do The Work. That is all that matters, Doing The Work. Let discipline be the best master. The samurai. Time to get the shit together. From tomorrow, the schedule will be:

8am - video duration - 5min -> Breathing session
8am -> Live meditation with samadhi center
9am-13pm -> Deep work writing session

This will be what happens every day from Sunday to Friday, and with this, I will crush it. Consistency is the ruler of success. That is how I win, just by being consistent and learning how to play the game. Learn how to play the game, that is all that takes. The game of life.

This is who I am when all the doubts are in play. I start making sense, understanding what happened and fixing the stuff so that in the future it won’t happen again. It’s just what it is. I am what is behind all these doubts. I am the one who trusts.

I JUST WANT TO BE A HUMAN BEING, AND EXPERIENCE HOW IT FEELS.
