Hello from the other side. The meditations are getting deeper and deeper. Há, all this time (this was also an expression of what I’m going to speak about now, so it is present all the time, but I’m working on it). Saying all this time is much less specific than saying the last two weeks, or two months, or whatever. Saying that ‘the meditations are getting deeper and deeper’ is also a way of running away from being specific towards today’s meditation. That’s something that I have noted a lot since I have this approach to life related to seeing the big picture in the small one. In every action, in every experience, there is the information of a lifetime. And the value of that is huge. When I started realizing this there was a shift in the way on which I engaged in conversations, in the way on which I am interested in what other people are talking about.

Say I’m talking to my father and he is sharing with me the story of when he first went to a soccer match. It could be easy to jump from this one to the next one, and so this kind of story jumping as a game to entertain the mind. But if I go deep into the first story, and ask him more specific questions about that one, the level of connection that I will develop with him because of that experience and conversation will be deeper because I will bring more of what he is out of the sharing of that story. There is enormous value on doubling down like this, and since I discovered it, it is a staple in my menu of tricks and techniques that I have for being more present. With this, I’m allowed to be more present to what he is saying, because it suddenly has a different level of importance. I mean, it is not truly that it has a different level of importance, that importance is related to my own state of being. For me it becomes more important, because there are different avenues for exploration in the story itself. And I have found a lot of value on that, and I have it present a lot.

That’s why when I come here and start writing about ‘the meditations are getting deeper and deeper’, I feel that I miss the point, because I don’t allow myself to talk about the one that just ended. That is the one that is present in the whole of my being, and if I don’t speak directly because of it, from it, with it, I will lose the freshness that I have inside related to what happened in it. So let’s explore what comes.

I sat for 60 minutes, and yesterday ate a lot. It was the birthday of my wife, and we went for lunch to eat to a great pasta restaurant, and then for dinner to eat to another place that was very nice. And I ate a lot during the day, and the last 2 days I have eaten stuff that I’m not used to, things that I don’t trust do good to my body, but they are good for the pleasure centers (I’m emptying these pleasure centers though. It seems that food is bringing me less pleasure than before. I mean, I love eating, but it is not like WOOOOW this is the best thing that I have eaten, this is the best moment of the day. Nope, I don’t feel like that too much. Eating is more like the excuse to be together with family, to sit down and have a conversation, to just share a moment together). Yes, the pleasure centers, which have been active because of the sugar and carbohydrates and chocolate and all this stuff, but that I’m trying to compensate with the long term impact in my whole system. And the thing is that I don’t need to see to much in the future to witness which is that long term impact, because I could see it today in the meditation.

In one hand, I had all this crazy sensations going around, like electricity in the brain, and in other parts, with the noise in the background always that there was something that was not quite in the correct place in the area of the abdomen. That is the place where things are weird, and I know it is related to what I have eaten these days. So the question that I ask myself is: When will I allow this to stop? A big part of myself is anxious about the process that I’m going through, and food is a big channeler of that anxiety. Another aspect of myself wants to feel close to my family, to my wife, and food is a big glue in that realm. So I give up my discipline related to fasting and stuff and I just eat whatever comes, and these are the consequences. But I completely accept them, because they are the most pure kind of information that I can get related to the impact that different types of food have in my system. And it also feels that this can’t go on together, and that in some moment (sooner than later) I will have to get my shit together and just say no. That moment is when I will start thinking about the importance of next day’s meditation the night after, or the day after, and preparing for it with the information that is there because of my experience. I think that that hour of meditation every day is going to be the most important part of my day, for sure, and eventually it will take on every other aspect of my life. But for now, I’m here, enjoying as much as I can my family, and giving them my presence.

I was not able to come yesterday to write, and it is perfect like that. There is nothing that should have been done. This book is an exploration into what happens when there are no more shoulds in life, so what happened yesterday is just a step towards that direction. I could say that I should have written a bit more than only one page, but fuck it. I did not have time for it, for as much as I would have liked, and it is ok. I embrace it, and I feel good about it.

So yes, the meditation today was deeper. I wouldn’t say that I was able to leave my mind without thoughts, and that is great because I know that it will never happen. But it feels like the gap between having a thought and realizing that I’m thinking and that I went away from the object of concentration is becoming smaller and smaller. And that feels like progress because I’m better able to stay present more of the time. And presence is all that is, with the thoughts, with the sensations, with the emotions, with the pain in the belly, with anything that arises. It is everything just part of what is there, of what is real in that moment, so I embrace it as it is. Today that question came a few times: What is real? Is this pain in the belly real? How am I sure about that? And in that exploration sensations came, and it was good. I certainly feel that there is a transformation going on inside me that is stronger than ever. In the nights before going to sleep is crazy, it feels like my third eye is going to become alive in some way and all my life force is concentrated in that place.

Yesterday night I filled the bathtub of the hotel with water so that I could give myself a shower there and I was a long time inside the hot water just enjoying being there, waiting for my wife to arrive (she never came) and feeling what I was feeling. It felt like the sensation of being back to the womb, at least mentally, and there was a deep aspect of letting go present. I couldn’t completely because a big part of me was focused on the fact that I had just eaten a lot so I could not go through a major transformation, because it SHOULD happen in other moment, when you are more primed to it. That’s the aspect of myself that is waiting for something to happen, which is impossible for me to shut down. The most radical and important transformation of my whole existence is happening right now, in these days: How couldn’t I expect something particular to happen? How can I leave my mind away from the thought of: ‘Ok, now is the time when I wake up. Holy shit, I’m waking up. Hooooly shit, this is it. What should I do?!?! Should I meditate? Sould I laugh? Should I smile?’ These are a tiny fragment of all the elements of distraction that go through my mind almost… Anytime that I’m going through something that feels ‘special’ inside me. And there is some kind of avoidance of it also, I don’t know. For example yesterday the sensations were getting stronger and clearer in the bathtub and I shaked them and got up to go and look for my partner and she was sleeping in the bed with our little girl and she did not want to go so I had the opportunity to go alone or go to sleep and I was not brave enough to go back and face what was waiting for me there so I just went to bed and slept. I mean, I laid on my back (a position that also brings a lot of stuff into my experience, specifically in the night and in the area of the third eye) and travelled for a bit through the sensations that were present, but then I decided to sleep and turned around and just slept.

And yes, I did not go back to the bathtub because a big part of me didn’t want to face what was ‘should happen there’. And the same with the morning meditation today, there were moments on which I realized that I had spent a long time without breathing, so I had to breathe so that I could feel safe. I know that I was safe, that it was an important part of the process, but a big part of me doesn’t absolutely trust yet. And this is the thing with letting go, to opening to the unknown. I need to trust. But it is a process, a process of understanding how to deal with all the situations that arise, and a process on which I need to be tender with myself. Give me the space to be who I am in the moment, with the fears, pains, etc. There is absolutely no rush. That’s what I say to myself in a day like yesterday, on which I eat everything that I ate. I’m going to wake up, no matter what, in the near future. It is not something that I’m going to be able to take away from my existence and say: ‘You know what, I don’t want this anymore’. It definitely doesn’t work like that. And by giving me this space for just doing things that I ‘shouldn’t’ do, I move towards that tender space on which I give myself the time for doing things slowly, with patience.

A huge part of me is identified with food, and finds a lot of actual help in the eating of sugar for example. I feel anxious, and sugar is the way on which I’m able to regulate my nervous system. It is part of what it is, and by doing it consciously I’m better able to integrate what that particular substance means in my being, right now. It feels good to give me that space of integration, specially being with my parents, which remind me a lot of food because it was the time of the day on which we were all together. We used to sit down to have dinner at 8pm every day, and that was the moment on which I was able to share with my father and mother. There were a lot of fights and stuff that you could say is ‘not good’, but that is a polarization built on top of the notion that there is something better than another thing. It is not like that in reality, the only important thing is that something happens or not. So yes, a big aspect of myself is identified with food an loves eating, and it feels like these days I have been better able to tap into that connection. It is not that I’m eating everything that I find mindlessly (at least not all of the time), but there are certainly moments on which I make the conscious decision of eating something, and I try to enjoy it as much as I can.

And that is the thing, I have realized that I don’t completely enjoy most of it. Food is becoming a means by which I sustain myself, but definetly not the most important part of my life. I would say that in the depth of my being I prefer doing sports, or having a direct conversation looking at the eyes, than eating food. It is one of the biggest excuses in life, and my goal is to erase excuses from mine. Just act from the heart. Which is the alternative to go out for dinner with a friend that you have not seen in a long time? Just doing it, it doesn’t help anyone to try to ‘fix’ something that is such as deeply engrained in society as this. But what I can do is go there and offer my full presence to that person or those people, and just be there for them. The emphasis that I put in food is good, but it is not the most important thing. The important thing is what do I bring to them, and which is my truth. What is my truth in that moment? What is the gift that I’m giving to them? And from there everything can be built, and I’m getting to that place through the constant exploration into what it means to not have any dogmas.

Nowadays there is basically nothing to which I say no categorically. I drank a glass of wine yesterday, I ate fish, I ate a dessert with cheese, etc. It is all an exploration into what does each of those substances bring into my body, the whole experience, and with that I feel that I’m able to get a deeper understanding of myself. An integration of everything that I have been all this time.

These days have been very nice, because we came to a place to which we came every summer with my family. Walking those streets having grown, being a different person but at the same time the same, has been very informative to me. I appreciate it a lot. And my parents are happy, and I feel that my girls too. I’m doing my best here. Giving my best to each one of them. There are moments on which I fail and everything goes to the floor and I have to start all again, but overall these are moments of big growth. My little girl is amazing, and having her to go to different places and listen to different ways of talking and different cultures is something very valuable for me. And I’m sure that for my wife too.

I have given up a lot ‘workwise’ because of going to all these vacations and not working enough, but it is also a big part of finding that balance that will help me to realize which is the person that I’m going to be. And on the other side, my parents are not going to be around forever, and now is the time on which I can get to know them better, enjoy their presence, enjoy the way on which they interact with my little girl, and just spend this time with them. And give that gift to me also. This has been a very special trip, because there have been a lot of moments on which I’ve had realizations that have made me feel relief. And that relief feels even physical. For example, yesterday in the morning we were having breakfast and the people from the kitchen brought a cake with a candle so that we could sing to my wife and he was recording with his phone. I have since a long time been offended by this attitude when I’m with other people, because I think to myself that they are ‘wasting the experience of the present moment’ because of recording the video to watch it later, or to send it, or whatever. Inside me, what happens is that they dissociate themselves because of the phone. I have seen this in amazing landmarks in the world, with the greatest sunsets, and people witnessing it through their phone. Until yesterday, this was something that made a lot of noise inside me, because I felt that we were going to a horrible place because of people wanting to record instead of witnessing with their own eyes.

But yesterday I realized that that can also be an experience of the present moment. The way on which he was deriving the most out of that moment, was through recording it with his phone, so that he could send it to his friends, or whatever he wanted to do with it. That IS a valid way of spending his time as we were singing her happy birthday. It IS the way that makes more sense to him, in that moment, and that is why he is doing it. Who am I to judge that? Who am I to blame? No one. It doesn’t matter. If I find more value just by being a witness and enjoying it without the meditation of technology, it is perfect like that. Just do it. But make sure you respect the way on which other people decide to do things also. This was a big eye opener yesterday, because now I realize how much I have judged other people because of doing something like this. And what is the use of it? Why do I even care? I can only control my own life experience, the things that I do, what I care about, and caring about what other person decides to do in a particular moment doesn’t help at all. It is just noise. And I want to break free of that noise. I want to integrate it fully, and move towards the rest of my life without it. It ends up being a burden. And I don’t want that burden on top of myself. I just want to be able to enjoy every second of my experience as a human being, to be present with what is, and if I’m there judging him because he is recording, or even worse, telling him to stop, I’m just being the asshole that I have been for a big part of my life.

It is time to evolve, my friend, and that evolution involves acknowledging everything that has been done in a way that is not conducing to peace, to harmony, to love. From myself, to my close family, to the world. How do I want to bring love to the world if I’m not even able to bring love and respect into the relationship with my father? That whole situation yesterday by itself pays the whole journey. I’m not saying that it won’t happen again, I’m just saying that I already realized it. And not with someone telling me to do it. I realized that there was a better, more harmonious way of relating to life, and I’m looking forward to implement it more and more in what I do.

## As this, there have been many moments on which I have seen myself in a situation on which I could have said something mean, or bad, or whatever, and I just realized it and let it go. It even happens with wanting to do stuff. I have always been a person that wants to take out the most of life, and that manifests in the necessity of ‘doing things’. Specially if I’m away in a country that is not mine. I want to go around, explore, and be the witness of what is happening. But on this trip I realized that it was ok to let go of that, and I have given myself the permission to not be pushing the group to do something particular. I just go with it. I’m trying my best to be present with what shows up, and be the witness of how I react to it, or what it brings to my life. And that is the most informative thing that I have found. I feel in peace with it.

The human body is the most amazing miracle of our lifetime. A machine that touches the pond of perfection in many ways, and that we are just beginning to understand. I’m every excited to be in the forefront of the exploration of how to get the most out of it. Is it that this is what they speak about when they talk of the actualized individuals? I’m not sure. But I’m sure that there is a huge potential awaiting to be revealed, and that will show up as we transition from the old way of doing things to the new one.

And what is present now is a conversation that I just had with a woman who asked me what I was doing in the computer, and what do I devote my time to in my life.

‘Right now, I’m writing a book’.

‘Aah, so you are a writer! That’s so nice’.

And I realize how much our identities are built on top of these labels. I’m writing a book, so I must be a writer. And I realize how much I forcefully try to stay away from these labels, by just avoiding them. She said that I’m a writer and I don’t feel represented by it. It feels like something on top of my shoulders that won’t let me move freely. But what if I embodied that as true? What if I started calling myself a writer? How would that change the perspective by which I interact with life? The conversations that I would have? It is absolutely different than saying that I am an engineer, or a programmer, or a breathwork practitioner, or all the other labels that I could put on top of myself. What if I loosed this bond with ‘not having labels’ and I opened myself to the possibility of becoming something specific? Of exploring an avenue that would bring growth to my life? And it doesn’t mean that I don’t do anything else, by any means. At the end of the day, those labels are for society to recognize us for something particular, is for the people that are around us to feel closeness (or not) with what we do, and to give them a frame of reference. What doors would be opened if I gave the people with which I interact this frame of reference?

I have always felt comfortable by not doing that, and by presenting myself as a mass of stuff that is hard to define. But how can I move towards the truth of my being if I avoid sharing who I am right now? The thing to which I’m devoting my whole attention in this moment is writing this book, and it is very important to acknowledge that, to give it energy, from the speech that I share with the people that I interact with. Myself, and those people, are the ones that build me into who I can become if I’m able to embody all the why’s I’m doing what I’m doing. How do I want to be open to the feedback that other people can give to me if I don’t give them the cues that will lead them into the curiosity to what my work is about? I have never trusted my work enough to share it in this way with the world, and now it is time. Now is the time to be alive.
