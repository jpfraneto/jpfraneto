Yes, there is fear for that opening to come. As I go into the deepest aspects of myself in the practice of meditation, I can sense that there is a deep hesitation that comes from somewhere inside, from the area of the solar plexus, at the base of the stomach. There is something that is held there, a strong, primal emotion, that won’t allow me to make the progress that I need to make so that I can feel complete. But I’m getting there, you know. I’m on the road to feeling how it feels. I’m on the path of becoming who I will become when I’m free of all this. Of the wanting to be someone different. Of the avoidance of what is. Life is just what is, and in the avoidance of that there is a distance between me and what is experienced. And it is time to dissolve that distance. To make me part of everything that happens in my environment, of everything that is. It is time for me to embody every aspect of my reality so that I can live up from there. So that I can explore what it brings. So that I can manifest what it brings. It is time for me to become more and more of who I am, and that is what I have been telling myself all this time. And this writing is what allows me to do that. Coming here and just vomiting whatever comes up is the means by which I’m able to do it. It is the way on which I can clear up my unconscious, so that it can allow space for the deepest aspects of myself to shine through the space that is left. I like the analogy of the conscious and unconscious being like water and oil, and how the more you make the unconscious conscious more of tha oil is brought into the surface so that it can be integrated and transformed into water, so that eventually all my experience as a human being is just water, is just the beingness that comes from allowing me to just be. To live through who I am, and have always been. This is an ongoing process, one which will enable me to be doing this forever. I’m building a system that will enable me to come here and show up every day, and create something cool from there. Have an experience as a human being that is embodied into his truth by just sharing it with the world. Whatever it may be. It is just what it is, you know? I’m here, experimenting with my truth, and manifesting it as a reality as I move on and on in the path of what it means to be created. I navigated the journey from the school system to studying engineering to dissolving everything I knew was possible so that I could empty myself and allow the wisdom and power to arise from there. This is the means by which I let myself do that. This is how I become surprised of myself, of my reality, and give energy to that happening. It is just that. It is just the summary of my beingness, it is just the gathering of who I have always been and the translation of it into my own truth. The one that I’m here to share with you. Building up those artificial frames that make me believe that I will be able to better connect with myself if I build a particular framework that will get me going in a new direction. That is the part of me that wants to change, to control, to bring up new stuff to fix what is already in place.

But the truth is that there is nothing that has to be changed. What is going on is already perfect, it is already complete. My experience as a human being is complete right now, and the fact that I’m not able to see it because I think that there is something that needs to be fixed is a consequence of the division that my mind builds up as a way of understanding what is going on. The mind wants to control, wants to know, and in that openness of not knowing it gets lost. And it is not its domain of action. It is not the place where it feels comfortable. So it starts protesting. The mind doesn’t feel comfortable in the creative act, because it is an opening to the unknown. It is an opening to something that is beyond. And in that sense, I need to bring up something that I wrote about, that is related to the ritualistic approach to the creative act. I’m here, to create, once more, the reality of my own and particular truth. I’m here to connect with everything that is beyond, so that from there I can manifest more of what is already here. I’m here to surrender myself to the higher power that is deep within me, so that from it wisdom can arise. So that from it my truth can arise. I’m here just to explore what my life brings as the message that will help me be more and more present. Because in my presence magic happens. Yesterday I had a breathwork session and I was almost fully present for the person that I was working with, and that brought up a transformation in her. It is time for me to do that for myself also, so that’s what the ritualistic approach to this whole thing is about. I’m here to open up my truth as I write, and to explore what it brings. I’m here to become more of myself, to surrender to my truth. To give up the control, and explore what is at the other side. I’m here to become more and more and more of myself. I’m here to navigate the waters of wanting to be who I am. To navigate what lies at the other side of just being myself. Or at this side. Or everywhere. The sole perspective of there being a possibility of integrating everything that I am into the way of being that is completely anchored in the present moment is something that calls for all of what I am. It is the highest motivation that I can hope for.

And I have been walking that path, you know?

I have been travelling the road of rewiring my nervous system so that it can be more connected to what is truly here, and less to what is not. I’m rewiring it so that I can open up the doors of the magical, of the mystical, of the infinite. I’m here to open up those doors and create from there. I’m here to explore the infinite possibilities of everything that is, and everything that has ever been. I’m here to just be myself. To allow myself to be myself. To express my truth, and to build from there. I’m here to create the future on which I will live. This is something that I have repeated over and over again, but it is truly my truth. I’m here to become empty of everything that I’m not, so that everything that I am can be manifested from within. I’m here to explore my truth, so that it can arise from the manifestation of my beingness through each one of my actions. I’m here to be the witness of my own reactions, and to challenge all those reactions so that I can integrate all the messages that they bring. I’m here to Do The Work, the hard work of integrating all the biases that have been built in my experience as a human being by living the experiences that I have lived. Life is an amazing journey, and as I open up to this kind of challenge I become more and more of myself. And that feels good. It feels inspiring. And it motivates me to relate to life in a completely different and new way. And it starts with the way on which I build the language that I use.

For example, with my 1 yo daughter, each time that I say “She is …” I’m defining her, I’m establishing a boundary into her experience of reality, and I’m actually limiting her. It doesn’t serve the purpose that I see in the long term, because it brings into the interactions that she may have the predisposition of the person that is there (and also herself) to be in a particular way. If I tell her: You are this, you are that, etc, I unconsciously fixate her actions towards that way of being. And it may be that she has a specific trait of ways of doing her thing. But it doesn’t help me to be explicit with that, because what I end up doing is carve those aspects into stone. And it doesn’t feel right. I don’t want that relationship with her. I just want to help her be free, and the way that most resonates with me to do that is just allow her to be different every day. Not determine who she will be today because of what she did yesterday. That is not helpful. This is something that I have seen myself do, and it is part of what I am learning in dealing with being a father for the first time. Each new day is a new learning. And I mean, this is helpful for my relationship with every person. If I see a friend that the last time I saw him was 8 years ago, the best way to engage in that conversation is to eliminate every predisposition that I may have related to who that person is. Allow change to come through the experience of who that person is right here, right now. That’s why a part of myself likes that I’m becoming less and less attached to memories. They don’t help me enough, because they prevent my capacity of being with what is. With what that specific and particular moment brings. And that is for me, today, a life well lived. With the capacity of being present. With the intention of being there with everything that is. It’s the journey of exploration into the void, into the unknown, and it is just in that that I’ll be able to evolve. And I’m already fixating myself, and doing what I said I wouldn’t do. How do I know that that is the way on which I will evolve? Is it helpful to put that burden on top of my shoulders? I don’t think so. It doesn’t help me enough. Why don’t I just allow freedom to come. Freedom to be. Allow myself for freedom to be.

And now I want to talk about regret. I have been relating to it quite a lot these last two days, as I have been witnessing people become very attached to decisions that they made in the past that now seem as if they were not the best ones. What is the role of regret in the experience of human beings? Again, I can only talk about my own experience, and I can do that right now so that I can better understand what it brings, where it comes from, and which is its role. There have been moments on which I regret having a baby with the woman that I’m with, because there are aspects of myself that believe that life could be better if I hadn’t done it. But of course, this is all a construct of my mind, which wants to create stories about things that could have happened but didn’t. If I allow myself to believe these stories, I’ll end up falling in the trap of thinking that there is a different path that could have been. But it isn’t. The only reality that there is is what is present, right here, right now, and what can help is to witness each moment with the perspective of it being a gift. From life, so that you can better understand yourself. The role of regret is that it is a reminder of the reasons why we did what we did. Whatever decision that we made in our life, it is because of something. There is an aspect of ourselves that was present with that decision, that made it, and it is important to connect with that aspect and witness how it has evolved since that decision was made. Where am I when I regret having done particular things? Who is the one that regrets? Where does it even come from? From the non acceptance of what is. It is another way of living in time, because regret is built on top of the belief that there is something that could be different of our present moment. There is an aspect of you that believes that you could transform what is going in your life and bring a new experience into it, and in that transformation there is hope. In the hope of that transformation. The regret comes from wanting that transformation to take place, but not being able to do it because generally what you regret is something that cannot be changed.

This is a key aspect of regret, it is often related to something that you can’t change. It is fixed in your experience as a human being. And the hope of having taken a different path is what brings up that regret. “If only I had been able to be more conscious about this thing.” If only I had given me the opportunity to be aware of the consequences of what this would bring. Those are all things that start building the reality of something that is not there, that could be different, and in that search for something different to be you can get lost. I have been there, lost in the searching of the many ways on which life could be different. “If I had only not done that”. It is all built on top of the mirage of things being different from what they are, right here, right now. It is just an expression of something that could be different but is not. If we could just better understand that there is nothing that we can change, and accept that, we would become free of all this regrets. We would start being more responsible for our acts. Maybe there is a relationship with this, I can feel it. Between regret and responsibility. The moment that you regret something, you cease to be 100% responsible for what is. I’m not even sure about this, but it is what comes now as information that can be integrated. What is the relationship with being responsible (conscious) and regret? That’s the question that I’m exploring right now, I’m looking for that answer so that I can better understand this whole game on which I put myself into.

I guess that a good starting point is related to the decisions that we make. Where do they come from? I think that if they come from a place of truth, it will be harder to have regret inside afterwards, because you’ll know that it came from a place of truth, of your own truth. That’s why I think that it should be a priority for each human being to connect to their own particular truth, as soon as they can, so that each decision that they make afterwards comes from this space. If I’m able to tap deeper into my experience as a human being and make decisions from there, they’ll be more conscious and responsible. I think that the consequences of these decisions will be less spoken as ‘mistakes’, and they will be more connected to people realizing them as information that can help them evolve in some way. All what I’m living right now is a training ground for my own evolution, and in that belief, I can free myself from the burden of having to please someone else than myself. Life is a playground for each one of us, it is just a matter of opening the eyes and being there with whatever arises. Just feel how it feels. Open that door. And leave it open. Allow yourself to feel how it feels. Allow yourself to be transformed by the acceptance of all what is. Because one day you’ll die, and you’ll realize that everything that we were doing here was playing a game, of the evolution of your own soul. I’m here to evolve my soul, my relationship with the infinite, and in that sense, regret is just part of it. The important thing is to establish a relationship with the role that regret is playing as the means for this evolution to happen. What does it bring? How is it helping? How is it serving as something that can help my soul to be manifested with more clarity through my life?

And more than this, which is my role on walking alongside a person that is full of regret, and that is not in a good physical, mental and spiritual shape? How can I embody what it is needed for me to walk alongside this person? It is hard, I have been very challenged this last year. I know that the first step of them all is not wanting to change her regret. Not wanting to change the experience that she is having, because it is the information that she needs to develop a healthier relationship with herself. If she took the decision of doing something that she now regrets, the only thing that I can do that will have a deep impact is not trying to change her experience. Is not about giving her advice, or whatever. It is just by opening the door to listen to her, with empathy, compassion, and with the openness that is needed to truly feel how she feels. To be with her in her regret. It is ok. Everything is ok. The only thing that she truly needs from me is my presence, my beingness. My allowance for her to feel how she feels, to feel what is there. And from there, allow her own inner guide to do its work. Presence is in there, being manifested by each action that is undertaken. It is easy to forget this and fall into the trap of wanting to help, of giving unsolicited advice, but it is important for me to catch those things and let them arise in a different way. Allow me to express myself in relationship to her in a new way. A more empathetic one. One that is connected to what the regret brings into her life. One that is connected to the message that is being brought. For her to witness it. For her to experience it. For her to navigate what is present with that message as a companion in every moment of her life. That is what love is. Being with the other person, in regret or in love. Walking alongside her with compassion, with care, and with the willingness to hold the space for her own evolution. Not wanting to change her experience of reality, but just being there for that experience to manifest fully. Not judging, just witnessing. Life unfolds through each and every emotion that is felt.

I have brought all these different practices into my life, the power of breathing, the power of meditation, of connecting with my core, and I have not been able to bring them into my creative process. So this is the moment on which I give me that space, just to connect with what is present inside as I dive within for the next 3 minutes.

So what is there is just the willingness to bring more and more clarity into my relationship with myself. It is the exploration into what clarity means, into how it is manifested in the experience of a human being. What is clarity about? How does my beingness become helpful for bringing more of that clarity into the world? Those are the aspects of myself that want to be expressed through my actions but haven’t been done properly yet. And again what comes is that infinite incapacity that I have for witnessing the place where I’m at. Yesterday I had a very powerful breathwork session with a person that I’m working with and she told me how important it had been for bringing more clarity into her. That’s exactly what I’m saying that I want to bring into the world, and it is very hard for me to congratulate myself and witness what I have reached. Because the fact that I’m able to hold space as I did it yesterday for this friend speaks a lot about the clarity that I have reached because of the path that I have walked, and it is time for me to acknowledge it. It has always been time for me to acknowledge the road that I have walked and that has me in this place right now. I’m exploring and experimenting and developing clarity towards myself, and that is something that needs to be worked. It is not something that will arise magically, it is something that I have to work in. And the same is with many other things.

For example, there was a moment yesterday on which I was driving and my partner was giving me directions as she was looking for the place that we were going to visit in her phone, and when she was doing this I felt a strong sense of her being very bad at doing it. Inside me there was a huge criticism related to the incapacity that I saw in herself by not being able to understand what was so obvious: How to follow the map. It was as if a dark cloud had come into the top of my head and became an interface of my relationship with her that didn’t allow me to see her for who she was. I put in between ourselves an unconscious judgment related to her intelligence, to her capacity of doing something as simple as following the instructions from the gps. And I could see the cricitism inside myself, and the dark cloud. And I sat with that for a while, feeling it, recognizing it as something that was present, until I realized that any criticism would not help us at all because it truly didn’t matter where we ended. We were just going to a random place, and the fact that I was open to that being slower of faster gave me the freedom to just sit with what was going on. Without being too critic with her, at least externally. And then I decided to tell her something nice, in spite of feeling something different inside, because I realized that everything that I was experiencing was coming from a place of division, and what was needed was to express this thing from a place of union. Of togetherness. So I just expressed something nice to her, and that feeling inside melted into an openness of wanting to know more of her. Of curiosity of her own truth, and how it expresses through her. And it was very helpful. It brought new sensations to me. And this is also being compassionate with myself, you know? Witnessing what is inside and allowing it to be. But don’t let it determine the way on which I’m going to experience the other people. If I close myself to the possibility of witnessing the other person for who she truly is, I end up determining who she is through my own experience, and that is harmful, both for her, and for the relationship. So what seems like a good approach is to just witness these sensations arise inside, stay with them a bit, but not react from them. Being conscious about my own actions, responsible for them, is allowing all these concepts to melt into the reality of what it is to truly want to best for the other person. If I had been angry at her because of where she was taking me with the gps, how would this have helped the whole situation?

That is related to that concept of giving an A, of the book “The Art Of Possibility”. Start by thinking that each person is just trying their best, and that that best is different from yours. She was trying her best looking for the road towards the restaurant, and it is ok like that. The one that feels that he is the one that needs to fix the behaviors of others is the one that has to give up. It is not my mission. It is not my mission to help them integrate how they are feeling. I’m not responsible for that. I’m only responsible for my own wellbeing, and for my own capacity of being sovereign of my own actions. And that’s why it is so important to connect with my truth, because it will help me have better relationships. Is my truth connected to the tendency that other people have to critizise? If I base my value on that, I’m go anywhere. I need to continue this path of developing the capacity of being the witness of what is going on inside me, so that I can truly decide how to act from there. Knowing that most of the things that are inside are unconscious behaviors that were taught to myself by life, but they are not helpful anymore. I mean, they are helpful because they inform the way on which I live, but that help is what I need to witness to evolve. That is the way on which I’m going to be able to connect with others. We are here for that. I am exploring everything that it takes to put myself aside and let the mirror be held in front of the face of others. And for that, I need to give up. The willingness to help others. The necessity of being there for them, even more when they don’t want to do that kind of work. Who am I doing it for? Is it for the others or for myself? I don’t have any doubt in the world related to this. I’m doing it for myself, and from there, for others. All my internal work is a selfish one, because I want to feel better myself. And I know that the consequence of that will be an opening in the world, and a gathering of all those who believe in this kind of work. All the ones that are available for Doing The Work. A

All of those that are part of the magic. The alchemy. The unwillingness to change others, only to be a better witness of myself and my own life experience. That is the magic. The alchemy. Opening up to the information that each experience brings into me as the means of becoming more of myself. It is very interesting to see how sleepy I have become in the last sessions of writing. I keep melting into that sleepiness, not knowing very good how to deal with it. I’m tired, and I slept more than what I was expecting to. It feels like a big part of this session has been happening in a state of trance, between the sleeping phase and the wake one, and I don’t recall too much of what has been said. And that speaks for a lot of the days on which I have come and written. It is impossible to come up with something that makes sense because I’m sleepy but it definetly makes sense because there is something fundamental that is happening inside me and the unconscious is being expressed through this words that I can’t recall enough. I wonder what will this writing bring to me in the moment on which I’ll decide to read it again. To process it in a new way, from the perspective of the one that is reading. To witness my own process of though, to be there for, to explore what it brings. I’m here, hoping to give my best to the environment that I’m in. And that environment starts with my direct family, my girls, and being there when they are not in a good place. I can recognize how much criticism there is in me related to what my partner should have done differently so that she could be a in a good position. When is the time that I give up having all the answers of what should be done and I just accept that she is going through it and the only thing that she needs is for me to give her a hug and let her know that I’m here for her? It is hard for me, but it is part of what I need to do to build more and more of that love that I want to bring into my life.

At the end of the day, love is a game that is played in first person. The more you give of it, the more you open up the perspective of offering love to life, the more you’ll receive. And that starts with acceptance, of who the other person is, of where she is at. If I bring more of this acceptance into the relationship that we have, I’ll become free of the burden of wanting to change her experience. Change who she is, right here, right now. Because all of those drivers to change the other person are built from each moment on which we interact, and the way on which I’ll be able to change them is also built in each of those moments. Every one of them is a training ground, on which I can experience what is brought into my experience, witness it, and explore what is at the other side of that. The universe lies in the smallest place of them all, and the windows of eternity open up in each small interaction. That is from where love arises. From approaching every interaction, for as small as it can be, with the perspective of it being an openness into the eternal joy of what it means to be alive. Each small window is an opportunity to manifest something new. By embracing what is present, and making a conscious decision to act upon that. If I’m disappointed by the way on which she gives me directions, just witness that disappointment and realize: Which is the best course of action that I can take having this in mind? Is it to express my disappointment or finding an alternative through which love can be expressed between ourselves? Every moment, every interaction, can be the means by which more consciousness can be brought into the world. And that is built over the experience of what it means to make a conscious decision, of how to relate to each other, of what to say, of what to shut up. It doesn’t help to stay there without action if I see her depressed. It doesn’t help to be infected by her depression. To criticize her for her depression. It only helps to bring her up, and the way on which I’ll be able to do that is just by being there for her. Trying to bring light into her darkness, so that she can blossom from there. The universe is present in each small action, and the depression of the world, which is my mission to help recover, is present right here in my house. How am I going to deal with it? What is it that I’m going to bring as the actions that will help this be evolved in some way? Which are the limits of where I have to put my energy? These are all explorations that need to be done, and every day, every interaction, is the training ground. Let us not forget that. Through this ritual of writing I open up to the acknowledgement of this as a reality, and I raise my hand to ask for help from everyone that is listening.
