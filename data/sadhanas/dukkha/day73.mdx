There is a remarkable aspect of doing something like what I have been doing for the last 72 days here and it is that you then get to look back and feel that incredible feeling of: Holy shit, what a long journey it has been. It is even hard to realize that I have been coming and showing up for such a long time. I wonder which are the words that have been written. Which are the thoughts that have been shared. Generated. Come up with. How am I different because of what I have written here. I wonder how does a process like this change me. Because I had done it before, I had done the showing up for the creative endeavor before, but not like this. Not writing as much as I have written all this time. Not vomiting everything that comes up without even realizing if it makes sense or not. Never before I have given me an opportunity like this one to be free.

And it is hard for me to see it. To express gratitude to myself and to life for being able to. I have given me one that could seem as the ultimate possibility for freedom. To just come and share what is present right now, without any boundaries and limitations. In that sense, writing is something like a journey into the void, into the unknown, because it is only you (me) and the blank page. Each day starts with the blank page, and the exploration that comes about from there is very special. It is transformational. I don’t know in what sense, but it truly is. And it is just that I’m exploring how to do it, and it feels good. I remember a book called ‘The War Of Art’ on which the guy finishes up the book that he as writing and goes to his mentor and he tells him: ‘Start the next one, right away’. Maybe that is the thing that I’m going to be end up doing. Just showing up every day with what is present, without having to change it in any way, without having to transform it. Just being with it. Just sharing my truth in the eternal 88 minutes of ranting whatever is in there.

There are moments of my life where I have thought: Could I be doing this forever? Is this something that makes sense as something that I could do the rest of my life, every day? And I have not felt anything as what I feel when I write. And I’m not talking specifically about what I’m experiencing right now, as I write. I mean, it is interesting, it is like unleashing something that is deep within myself, but the most valuable part for me is the one of being a witness of what ends up coming into being because of this. It is about the transformation that is experienced in me through the writing. The opening. The window that is open. And I like it that way. I keep thinking that it is my mission to develop an intelligent system that can be the means by which I’m able to translate all this writing into something more concise. I love systems. They make me feel grounded. If I had a machine to where I could send this writing afterwards and it could process it for me I would feel inspired, complete. It is like merging all the things that I love about the world: The commitment to show up and Do The Work, but at the same time the lack of attachment to the end result. If I give a third party the responsibility for the end result, it helps me become free from it. And I want to become free from it, because I just want to come and write, you know. That is my mission. Just come and write. And now I’m on Day 72, and I told myself that there would be 88 days, but what happens if there is no finish line and I just keep doing this forever? What if this is my Sadhana, the spiritual practice that helps me transform who I am every day? That helps me embody more and more of who I am by just sharing openly whatever is present?

This is the most transcendent therapy that I have gone through, and it has been inside the maze of my own mind. There is an aspect inside me of wanting to get out of here and become free from the burdens of being my own master, but there is another aspect that loves it. I love the challenge. I love the consistency. I love what it means to come here and show up every day. That is what I love doing. Just showing up. For others. For myself. Holding space for transformation, and by doing this that I’m doing here I’m holding the space for my own transformation. 88 minutes. That’s what I’m doing here. Just holding space for my 88 minutes of glory. Of transformation. Of exploration into what is. What can be. What will ever be. I’m being through this writing, and it is the means by which I allow myself to be transformed by just being. The beingness that makes me become more and more of what I am. Through each one of these words. Through each one of the concepts that I’m not. In the moment on which I categorize myself, in the moment on which I fit myself into a particular frame, I stop being myself and I become something that other person expects me to be. Or even myself. If I categorize myself into something I become something that I expect me to be. I expect to be the one that I was yesterday. And I don’t like that. I just want to be free from any willingness to be someone different. I just want to experience life from the perspective of what it means to be free. To explore life from a place of not wanting to be someone specific. Of not wanting to fit. There is a deep need in me related to not wanting to fit. Of being the weird one. But not calling the attention by that, but just being it, you know? I don’t want to be pointed with the finger and looked upon and told that I’m special or different or whatever. I truly don’t care about that. I just want to be who I am, and who I have always been. And that is only through my actions, through my being-ness. Not through the fixed categories under which I could fit if I did something specific, or special or preconceived. There is nothing that is preconceived in this space. I just come here to explore.

What comes.
What goes.
What is.
What isn’t.
Who is that?
Who is the one that is writing?

All this is an exploration into what is, through each word that comes. Into the beauty of what it means to be alive, into the beauty of what it means to be sitting on the terrace of the apartment and watching the sun go up from the back of the mountains. What an amazing city I have lived in most of my life, and it is time to acknowledge that. One of the biggest mountain ranges of them all decorates the horizon of my view right now, with a mist that reminds that the new day is coming. With warm colors, contrasted with the green of the trees that are building up the energy needed for going through the summer that is showing up with all its strength. What an amazing city, and what an amazing time of the year.

But, you know, each time of the year is special. I remember those winter nights in my house, with a lot of rain outside, and waking up very early so that I could build up the fire that would end up warming our house. Building that fire so that my girls could be warm in the morning, realizing that that is one of my duties as the one that drives the house, that makes it work. Living in the countryside is very special because of all those small rituals, which connects me with the mundane, with the daily tasks that put the feet in the ground and help me anchor my beingness into what is necessary to feel the comfort of being warm. Allowing my girls to feel that, and sharing it with them.

That’s something amazing of living in the countryside, and I’m very grateful for those little elements. And right now I’m visiting the city where I was born and where I lived most of my life, and it is amazing too. It is an integral part of my life, and walking around with my little girl and showing her different parts of the city is something that fills my heart with joy. Today we’ll go to another park, to play with new children, to see new families. It is so interesting for me to witness the behaviors of parents when they go with their kids to the park. There is a big percentage of them that go with the cellphone stuck in their eyes, and as the kid goes around and plays and tries to call their attention, there is like a lost view in the eyes of the parent. As if what is happening in the cellphone was more important than what is happening just in front of them. Nowadays, the internet is more interesting than the unfolding of life through the flesh of your children. That is something that is very present right now, and it is just how it is. What happens in there is so interesting, fun, and addictive, that it is just too hard to give up. We are all into that maze, the one of the entertainment, of the constant necessity for being connected, and no one seems to know how to get out. It is a collective problem, and I think that we are reaching a point of acknowledging it and realizing how can we work together to find a solution.

So much has been said about children that are addicted to their phone, and about the young ones that are growing with it. But how much of this is related to the fact that parents are the ones that give the example? Our kids are just reflections of ourselves, and if they see us inspired, happy and motivated only when we are starting at our phones, what else are we expecting? This is just how it is, and it is time to acknowledge it so that we can move towards a new way of relating to this whole issue. What I do when I stay with my daughter is to do my best effort to not see my phone. It is not easy because there is always this craving for knowing what has happened in social media, but going through those sensations and witnessing where they come from and just letting them be is helpful to better understand myself. So I just use that as a cue to get to know my relationship with these technologies better. Of course I’m not able to do it always and sometimes I just need to check what is going on, but I least I try to be mindful with the whole thing.

Humans are social creatures, and that is why social media has had such a big impact in the way on which we relate to ourselves and others. The fact that you can be connected to the whole world, and exposed to it, is amazing. It just brings so much in. There are aspects of it that just can’t be denied, and in that exploration there is the beauty of what it means to be able to connect with others. Especially with those that resonate with the way on which you see the world. That is why there are this siloes of opinions and views of the world, and this gives energy to the particular perspective that a group is pushing forward. This ends up having as a consequence extreme levels of polarization, because there is a tendency for people just to consume the content that resonates with what they already see. And the algorithms work like that also. They are designed to maximize engagement, and because of that, they have a big incentive to just show you what they think you’ll end up consuming. And that is something that resonates with what you already have consumed, and because of that, more and more opinions are narrowed into what already is the opinion that a person has. It is hard to get out of there, you know? If there is this kind of incentive it is difficult to get people to open up to new perspectives, so they tend to go deeper into their own narrative, which has as a consequence the polarization that nowadays is seen in the world.

My own and novel answer to this was to build a music recommendation system that is completely random. What you see is not determined by what you have seen before, but by just where the thing is going towards. It is like a radio, but without someone that decides which music is going to be played. Only randomness decides that. And in that sense, it is open to show whatever needs to be shown, and there is a lot of value in that. I have not been able to come up with a robust way on which to share it with the world, and I think that a big challenge is related to how it integrates with other tools. But I’m walking towards that, and I know that there is big value in what I have created. It is just that I need to better understand how to make it better. More accessible. I will create an app that people can download in their phone and with that have them listen to the music and also to the podcast.

The podcast… That is an eternal dream of mine. Having the opportunity to connect with random people from all over the world and just talk freely, without an agenda, without a particular route. The idea has always been in my heart, and it is part of everything that I want to bring to the world. It is part of the life that I’m designing for myself. I truly believe that in this moment of humanity there can be the possibility of designing the life of your dreams, and that is what I’m trying to do here. Maybe it doesn’t make any sense and I’m just wasting my words, but at least for now it is what my heart has been telling me all of this time. I truly envision myself opening up the door for other people to share with me the album that has been the most valuable in their life, and with that one, mix it as I help them navigate a breathwork session. I want to bring healing to the world, and by opening the door for people to be transformed by this I will move towards that. And making it open is going to be very powerful, I know that. It is hard for me to realize that I don’t need millions of people for this to work, I just need some thousands and it will come up as something amazing. And I have been digesting the whole thing and building it up and manifesting it, and that’s what I’ll continue to do. It is just my mission. I can’t help it, it always comes back. The dream of guiding a breathwork session every day navigating it with a random person of the world. Mixing her album and bringing the joy of music, of being alive to her. It is what always revolves in my heart.

One of the things, because I truly can’t be free from the thoughts, the ideas, and all the things that I think of myself doing. I truly can’t help to run from one idea to the next one, just trying to fit into my life ‘the perfect path’. This is my controlling aspect being manifested with all its splendor, and it is something that I need to integrate so that I can be free. I just need to rest in the fact that I do the work, and let that ‘doing the work’ be the means by which I inhabit the world. That’s everything that I need to do, and it is important for me to realize. And more than realizing it, embodying it with everything that I am. I just need to show up, and in that showing up there is the beauty that will end up transforming every day into what it is supposed to be. Into what it should be. And there goes the word again, as if things ‘should’ be in a particular way. That is an invention of my mind, of the controlling aspect of myself, that doesn’t allow things to just be how they are. And the biggest expression of that is within myself, for not allowing myself to be who I already am. I’m just this, and that is perfect. It shouldn’t be any different. I’m complete.

I’m a creative force of nature, and I’m discovering the means by which I can embody that into everything that I do. How can I live my life so that each thing that I do is an act of creation? How is that built as a reality? I’m just navigating it as good as I can, and it is my mission to become more of who I am. More of who I have always been. That’s the thing. That’s the whole concept that keeps coming up as I write this book. Becoming more of what I have always been, but I don’t let me see because of all the noise that is going around in my mind.

Yesterday it was interesting, because I remembered the friend of a friend that I always thought was very beautiful. I always wanted to go out with her, but never had the courage to invite her. So I kept telling my friend to tell her that she was beautiful. Never directly. And yesterday as I was witnessing myself I realized that if I was in that position again I would probably do things very different. I would just invite her to go out, and be sincere about what I think about the whole situation. “I think I would like you, and you would like me. Do you want to go out so that we can realize if that is true?” That is everything that was needed. Sincerity. Truth. But I never was able to relate to her from that place, because I didn’t trust enough what I had to offer. And because of that, I always stayed in my comfort zone, talking to my friend about how much I liked her and not stepping up to transform that into something different. I just bring this history into here because it speaks about all those fears that built up the relationship that I had with my life, and how much all of those are just noise inside my head. Or were noise in my head. I truly think that I’m a little bit more free from them than before. At least I feel that way. It feels so good to be truthful. To be able to speak your truth, no matter how it looks like, no matter which is the shape and color of it. Just let it out, and let the world react to it. It is so infectious to have it inside and just chew it over and over not being able to realize if it is something that ends up being real or not. Most of the stories that I told inside my head have been just that, stories, that don’t end up having a direct correlation with what happens in reality.

And that works in everything, you know? As I have told you other days, there are moments on which I decide to go in meditation and I’m in there and there are all of these stories and ideas inside my head and I tell myself that I’m going to go and make them a reality and then I do it and it is something completely different from all the stories that I had been telling me. It is just important to transform the ideas into a reality so that that mental space can be freed to come up with new ones. That is the way on which progress is made, and that is what I’m doing here with this whole writing and creation of the breathwork business that I’m coming up with. The transformational journeys. We will work with breathwork, hopefully with mushrooms, hopefully with cannabis and a crazy film. With different stuff. And we will be there exploring the depth of our relationship with ourselves using all these tools. And it is going to be amazing. And that is what I’m building, and it is time for me to embrace all that building aspect and just be open to witness what comes at the other side. Which is the transformation that will be brought into my experience as a human being because of being open to show up and Do The Work of creating something that did not exist before and with which you will be able to interact. Because I’m going to build something with the intention of transforming your world also. That is the thing. I’m here to transform my world and in the act of doing that I’ll transform yours also. I’ll leave behind every preconception that I have of the world and open to the possibility of becoming someone new, something new, walking alongside you. We are in this together, and it is just our mission to embody that through every action. Through every interaction. And I’m going to build the means for that interaction to happen. For that creativity to flow. However it feels like. Just let it flow. That’s what I come here to do every day, it may have sense, it may not. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. It is just what it is. And it is perfect like that.

Probably the aspect of this whole Doing The Work thing that I tend to leave aside is the fun one. I need to remind myself to be playful to just allow myself to have fun. It is as if there was something in me that told me that for doing serious work you can’t have fun. I wonder where that comes from, I guess that it is related to the way on which I grew up, the school that I went, etc. Maybe what I need is to seriously have fun. To be absolutely intentional with it. I’m here to have fun, and what comes at the other side is just a consequence of that. It is the exploration of what comes when you just show up to see what is present, and that is very aligned with what I have talked about of wonder and willingness to just witness what is present in each moment. Every day that I come here is a new exploration into what is present in me that particular day, and in that sense, it is an invitation to just have fun in that exploration. Open up to be a witness without wanting to change stuff, without wanting to manipulate it. Just with the intention to be with it. It is just what is.

The sun is hitting with a lot of power, the one that reminds me that it is the sun which gives life to everything that is here. The process by which nature is a constant loop and journey of energy flowing from one thing to another one is just amazing. In the last breathwork sessions that I have guided I have made the invitation to people to navigate their breath having in mind that it is the means by which they connect with life, with what is. The trees produce the oxygen that we end up breathing, and that oxygen is transformed inside our bodies into carbon dioxide which then is brought in by the plants and transformed again in the food that our body uses to work. It is just a perfect design. That is the thing, everything that happens around me is a perfect design, and it is time for me to acknowledge it and sit with it a little bit more. Because that is the kind of understanding that I need to bring in when I’m worried about what is going on in my body, or I don’t trust it enough. I’m going through a process of absolutely letting go of everything in my meditation practice, and it is very important for me to be able to realize that in that there needs to be a sincere and complete trust in life itself. The presence that is inside me is more intelligent than what I can conceive, and it is just ‘me’, the one that I am identified with, that won’t let me see that as the truth of how I’m dealing with everything that happens to me. It is important for me to be able to realize that so that I can open more and more the door of letting go of every piece of fear that I can have inside. Every stage of doubt. In the process of letting go there needs to be absolute trust present, and I know that I’m going through that right now. I’m still not there, for sure, but I’m sanding the wood, you know?

Today in the meditation every piece of tension that I felt inside was an invitation to relax. To let go a little bit more. To open up a little bit more the window, the door, the experience, into what is left when there is not a willingness to control my experience. To move towards a particular direction. To allow life to just be, to just manifest through me. To move myself to the side and just open up the floor for the absolute presence that is within me. I’m walking the path of recognizing how to do that, or, better said, how to not do that. What not to do. Because eventually any doing is just a different expression of me wanting to control something. Of me wanting to become someone specific. And that is not the way. The way is just allowing, just becoming empty, just moving towards a state of being that is connected to the beingness, to the non-doing. Giving up is just another way of doing.

Yesterday I watched a video on which they made fun of a guy that told his friend: “I have tried everything! Breathwork, meditation, yoga… Everything, and I don’t seem to get it.”. I felt him frustrated, and I could see myself in his words. And his friend told him: “Maybe you are too stuck in the doing, what if you open up more to the just being?”. And that gave me a message that I have been walking around all this time. What is it with all this doing? Where does it lead me to? But is very tricky, you know? Because I come here to write and to open up myself as much as I can to the beingness, just being through the words that I’m writing, but I don’t know if this is another way of doing and not acknowledging it or it is truly just being and I’m going through the process of becoming more and more of it. It is very tricky, when you have lived your whole life with this understanding of what it means to just do things over and over. Doing, doing and doing. And that is what life looks like around me, you know? People just doing, doing and doing, and no one (or very few people) just being. But I don’t know really, because it seems that when people haven’t gone any deep into this journey that I’m at they just are. It seems that people that have never cared about consciousness have it easier to ‘be’ than me that is trying to do it actively. I know that the problem lies in the trying, but I can’t help it.

I remember in the retreat when I said that I wanted to learn how to play. It is the same as saying that I’m trying it. In many senses, trying is very similar to shouldding. I’m trying to play is the same as saying that I should be playing. Why not just refer to the act that I’m embarking upon as something that I’m doing? I’m just playing. I’m not trying to do anything, and I’m not doing it differently than how it would look life if it was done ‘perfectly’ I’m just doing it, and it is perfect like this. This is the way on which it is being manifested in my experience, right here, right now. What needs to happen for me to open up the door of acceptance, of allowing to make mistakes, of just exploring?

And the funniest part of them all is that I write that question after having come here during almost 3 months to just show up and play with words. Just explore what comes. See? It is very hard for me to acknowledge what I have done, to witness it, and to realize that I have created something amazing. This, what has come up in all this time in each of these pages, through each of these words, is amazing. I’m acknowledging it, and I’m telling myself more and more of that so that I can inspire others to do the same. I repeat: I don’t know how this has changed me, but I know it has. I can look back and realize everything that has come up, everything that has been said, everything that has been stuck in the memory of time through the words that have manifested in each one of these sessions, and it is incredible. I’m just here expressing my gratitude, my compassion towards myself, and my love for life and everything that it entails. What an amazing journey. What an amazing opportunity.
