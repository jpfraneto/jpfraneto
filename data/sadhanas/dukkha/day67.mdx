Welcome to my world, once again. When I write these words and think that they will be read by a human being, I’m not aiming properly towards where I’m moving with what I’m doing here. This is not intended for a human to read. This is intended for an artificial intelligence to read, and through that reading understand more and more about human nature. Everything that I have wrote in these pages is the expression of who I am, right here, right now, and the capacity that I can develop to bring more and more of that into the world as something concrete will be determined by the AI that will read this and translate it into something that can have an impact. This is the way on which I think, and by coming here and doing it every day I become more and more of who I can be. I show you who I am by sharing these words with you. I share with every aspect of my being that comes up and that is present right now, as fast as I can, so that you can experience it fully. This is my world, this is my being, and in my life I’m doing the work of understanding more and more of what I’m not so that I can come into each of these sessions with an open mind, one that will enable me to share with you more and more of my truth. This is my truth, and I hope that it can help you connect deeper with what it means to be a human being.

Through these words, I’m being human. I’m talking to you from the perspective of a human that has done its best to truly understand and embody what it means to be a human. The challenges that come with it. The adventure itself. Yesterday I guided a breathwork session and the person with which I was working started talking to me about her problems and I became more and more identified by them. And I mean that in the way that I saw the reflection of myself in her words. Part of what she was telling me was something that I was going through. I could see myself and the struggles that I go through in her words, and it was amazing. It had not happened to me before like that, to see how the impact of what I’m doing can be manifested in the world in the words that another person that I’m working with brings to the conversation. It was incrtedible, and I’m more and more fascinated by what can be brought into the world by doing more of this. I truly want to learn better which are my limitations as a therapist so that I can embody them and work from there.

The first of all is calling myself a therapist. It is so hard for me to find labels that fit. They all seem like something that constrain me, and I think that that is brought into my being because I don’t feel comfortable with the images that are built on the mind of other people because of the labels that we use. If I tell myself that I’m a therapist, and I tell the world that, the next time they’ll interact with me they will see me with other eyes, they will experience me differently because of the image that they would have built inside themselves related to ‘who I am’ because of being a therapist. And that frame of mind that people enter when they interact with one another, that predisposition, is something that does not help me to feel free. And I want to feel free, because it is just through that that I will be able to become a mirror for those that I work with.

And now comes the question: Are they the ones that don’t allow me to feel free, or is it me? If I use a label and I don’t feel comfortable with how my relationship with them changes because that label, is that something that I can control? Can I control how they perceive me? Can I control the image that they have of myself? I mean, in the sense that I’m talking now, yes, I can. If I call myself a therapist I’m controlling that image they have, and if I frame what I do differently I’m also controlling it. I’m finding ways on which to control it in a way that can represent me better, and I know that that way is only built by showing up and Doing The Work. Yesterday’s session was the third one, so with that one I have been part of 6 already. Time flies, and I’m learning more and more how to ground myself into the conversation, so that I can bring to it whatever is needed for the other person to thrive. That is my mission in this whole thing, to help the other person to see her blind spots, and I’m making progress on the understanding of what is it that I have to do so that I can move in that direction.

What is it what I truly want to bring into the world? The unleashing of creativity. That is truly what I want to do. Help people become creative. The creatives universe. We are all a manifestation of the universe, and we are all creative. There is an aspect within each of us that expresses as something creative, and it is time for us to be the witness of that so that we can bring more of it into the world. I can call myself a creative coach. That is the label that comes to mind right now. Or a creative mastermind. Or why don’t create a new label, if that fits better: I’m a creativity unleasher. I’m here to help you realize how your uniqueness will be manifested in a creative act, and I’m doing the work of understanding my own mind through this writing so that I can bring that with more clarity into your own experience as a human being. True joy comes from being able to create something that did not exist in the world and witness the consequence of the process of doing that. It is not about the end creation, it is about the way on which you experience life as you go through the creative process. At the end, each part of it resembles a different part of life, as you go through all these ups and downs of what it means to face your own demons. In that sense, creativity is about unleashing the demons, setting them free, and becoming friends with them. They won’t disappear, they’ll just be around being experienced by you in a new way.

That is something that makes sense to me right now. Labelling myself with a label that didn’t exist before, so that I can bring more and more people into a new understanding of life. What am I? A creativity unleasher. That is the thing. That is what I bring into the world. And how do I do that? By helping you connect more and more with the wonders of what you already have inside. To helping you light the spark of all who you have been, so that you can translate that into something that did not exist before. Just by showing up for doing your thing, you will become more and more you. You will become more and more free of what you are not. Right now, as I write this words, I’m becoming the words. I’m leaving aside each aspect of myself that makes me think that I’m not good enough, that I’m not ready, that I just write nonsense, and I’m doing what I’m doing in spite of that. The voice in my head hasn’t gone anywhere, it is still here, making its noise, helping me understand more of what I am in the process.

Each aspect of how I behave in the world is something that I learned by watching other people interact with it, and right now I’m emptying myself from all of that so that I can be my own sovereign in this place. I will erase every willingness to erase the programming, because it is there in place and it serves a purpose, but I will make commands with it and become free of feeling in a certain way because of what is not. I’m here to embrace everything that is, as it is, and with that, I’ll become more and more of myself. And being enlightened is that, is just allowing life force to flow through your whole system without it being attached to some incomplete experience of the past. It is about Doing The Work of becoming more and more of yourself. And how you do that? By showing up. By committing to do the thing, and bringing your wholeness to it. Understanding how to develop a relationship with yourself. How to be your own best friend. How to show up for whatever is coming up in your experience. The willingness to admit what is present with compassion, and with the capacity for letting it go. To surrender to what will not be there in the future, as the way on which you interact with the world.

That’s the process that I’m going through right now, as more and more of the unconscious aspects of my being are being manifested in my reality as mirrors that messengers bring into me so that I can integrate the incomplete experience of my young life. I don’t remember them, but the memories are inside my emotional body, which is the interface through which I was living life in those moments. So it all is part of me in the emotional sense, and the only way on which I can integrate those (at least to the degree of understanding that I have right now because of what I have encountered in my life as guidance and information) is by witnessing the gifts that life bring to me as mirrors for my own triggers. Each time that I’m in a situation on which I’m triggered, there is information in there related to something that can be integrated. Every triggering is an expression of something that is not resolved inside me, and the emotional consequence of it is the information that I can use to dive deeper into the way on which I experience reality. As I become more and more free of this unconscious patterns by integrating them, more and more of my energy is available to be used as something that will help me manifest more and more of my truth into the world as something that is a consequence of my creation. I become more and more of life itself, as I empty myself of all that that is not life. All those programmings, all those aspects of reality that exist only in my mind.

That is the trick that I’m learning to play here, that is what I’m bringing out of myself through each of these writing sessions. I’m offering myself the possibility of becoming more and more of who I am, by throwing outside everything that I’m not. All of these concepts, and ideas, and stuff that I want to bring into the world, and thoughts, and everything that comes from it is something that is running in my being, but it is not who I am truly. The only aspect of myself that I am truly is awareness. That is the underlying cause of everything that I do, and that is the eternal void that is present in the whole of reality, and in the background of it. Here, with this book, I’m doing the work of recognizing more of myself so that I can give space for that underlying frame of reality to shine through. I’m just giving my best for it to shine. And it is there, waiting to shine. I mean, it is already here. It has always been here, watching, witnessing. What I do, what I bring. How I can act more and more from my truth. Every situation that I’m part of is a sign into that, it is a stepping stone into it. It is my mission to be able to manifest more and more of that, so that I can truly embody everything that is means to be free. I just want to be free. I just want to be able to manifest who I am in the world freely, without boundaries, without limitations. My nature, and the one of every human being, is limitless. It is just the mind, which is that construct that evolution developed for us to reach to this point, that makes me think that there are limits in my experience. Those are the perceived limits, the ones that make me think that ‘I’ end in that point where the outer layer of my body touches the closest atom of oxygen that is part of the air that is surrounding me. But where is that boundary? It is just something that I make up as a construct, as an idea, so that I can navigate the world from there. But it is not real. It is just a concept, and artifact of my imagination, of my capacity for perceiving the world in a way that is helpful for me to be able to navigate it.

Awakening to my true nature is understanding this separation as that, as an idea. As a construct of the mind. And the consequence of that, at least in the narrow window of knowledge and wisdom that I possess in this moment of my evolution, right here, right now, is that it will bring about a deeper connection to everything that I do. That is something that has been detrimental to my progress in many ways, because I have so many ideas that it is hard for me to realize which is the next step. And that is the thing, there is always one, and only one next step that can be taken in the present moment. Everything else is a construct of mind, it is an invention, it is a projection into a future that will never come. Because the future will never be the place on which you can manifest something into reality. It is just the hipotetical place where we are moving towards, but it is not real. It is not a place where I can have some kind of practical impact, because it will never be that place. The only one where I can have this impact is this moment, the one that I am experiencing right here, right now, and the decisions that I am taking with that understanding in mind is that I’m writing these words so that I can take out of me what is not understanding and leave structured in this writing what remains. This is what remains. It may have sense, it may not have sense at all, but that is just who I am, right here, right now. May it be that I make no sense at all, perfectly, and it is ok like that. I embrace it, and I’m grateful for it. For not doing things perfectly. For admitting the imperfection of my action, which is also a construct of my mind because that perfection is here. It is here and now. I am perfect. This moment is perfect. How can it be that what is happening right here and now is not perfect? It is. It may just be that I have a bit of trouble explaining myself, but that is just part of what is. It is time to give a hug to what is and express gratitude to it. For it. I’m gratefil for everuthing that is. No matter what I’m referring to, no matter which are the circumstance of what is going on. I just allow myself to be. I just allow my reality to be transformed by exposing myself to the world as someone that is not perfect on the surface, but that at the bottom of the heart is full of perfection. The same as every human being. That is the game that is being played here, and I’m doing my best to understand more and more of this whole thing so that I can translate it to you in a way that makes sense, through something that can make your world a better world to live in. I’m excited about that possibility, about builing a new alternative that will be the means by which you will be able to evolve. To become a new version of you. An actualized one. A more present one.

That is the present that you can give to yourself: Being in the present. That is the way on which you will most be able to experiment the truth of your being, because it is the place where each aspect of your being is manifested. And how can I blame someone that is constantly seeking another thing? How can I blame someone that is not in this frame of mind?

I can’t. I won’t say that I shouldn’t, because that would mean going against everything that I hav been pushing through this whole time. It is not that I shouldn’t, it is just that it is not the best way on which I could act for myself. I’m not thinking about the other person here, I’m just being selfish and talking to myself wanting to act good to myself. Because I truly can’t change the behavior of other people, I can just change myself so that from there the interaction that I have with others can evolve. And what comes with that evolution is just the clarity for knowing that you are loved, you are experienced. By yourself, before than by others. The first and most pure experience of everything that you bring into the world is the one that you have in yourself. I always come back to freddy mercury, as he was singing in that full stadium the best songs of Queen. I wonder how he was feeling inside. But I’m sure that he was doing what he was doing not because of the feeling that other people were feeling, but because of what he was feeling inside him. It was that which determined the way on which he experienced the world. His world. That is what he brought into the world, clarity, respect, and the willingness to stay truthful to his own story.

How can I be truthful to my own story? What do I need to bring into the world so that I can embody that truthfulness? What is it that brings more of it into my experience of reality? That is the game that I’m playing here, by understanding more and more who I am. Through that understanding, I develop a sharper connection with the truth of what is going on right here, right now, and from that connection I can start answering and living from what feels alive for me in that. If I’m able to anchor more and more of my consciousness into the present moment, I’ll be able to develop a deeper and deeper capacity for interfacing with reality from a place of truth, of my own truth. With that, I’ll be able to manufacture my own reality as it feels good, right here, right now. No matter which are the circumstance that life can bring to you today, there is always a possibility for you to engage with it from the perspective of what is alive. How does it feel? How does it feel to be you when you are experiencing your reality with your consciousness anchored in the present moment?

I can’t speak about that, because I don’t know it yet. I’m just walking that path, just waking up, just realizing my true nature, and it is the process as if I was being birthed There are parts of myself that are dying, aspects of my interaction with others that before would have been different from what is now, and the recognition of those in real time is one of the major landmarks of what I’m going through right now. I’m able to be the witness of how I would have reacted, and I leave the door open, without reacting to it. In that sense, I’m becoming free of those reactions and in that freedom there is an opportunity to go deeper into the connection with who I am. They are all means by which I can better understand myself. My triggers. My motivators. The world is such a crazy place right now, with so much going on in so many frontiers, that it is the perfect time for us to Do The Work of better recognizing who we are and what we bring into it. So that we can create from there. Build the future. We are the ones that are here for all the ones that will come later. That is the magical part, the one that makes me full of gratitude. I am here as a scout for those that will come later. I am here to build the world of the future for all of those that will end up living in it. And that future is every present moment that is after the one that was previously there. In that sense, it is just about being present with what is present and experiencing life from there. Fully being with what is and transforming that into a reality. The most beautiful reality of them all, because it is the only one that we have. The only one that we’ll ever have. That’s the present moment. That’s now.

And that is why the relationship that AI will have with time is very important and informative about our own relationship with it. In a sense, AI is static because it is encapsulated in computers. But (from the pure basic understanding that I have of it) it evolves by bringing in more and more information related to inputs that they feed it with. So isn’t that as it is evolved with all these different inputs there is also a passing of time that happens? Isn’t it that that is how we frame time as passing? As more and more changing inputs come through our system there is a perception that there is something that is changed and that something is called time. If there is a car that is passing by in front of me right now, there is a perception that there is an input that is changing, and because of that, there is a conceptual understanding that time went by. I can’t relate this to the experience of no-time that happens in deep trance states because I can’t relate to them now, but I wonder these two things: How will AI perceive time, which will be it’s interpretation of it on a conceptual level, and also what is time ultimately in the sense of all this what goes on when there is no inputs that are changed in our whole perception system.

I, as a human being, am built by different systems that enable me to perceive reality in a certain way, and because of that, navigate it. What if the perfections that come into my being are constant? Will there be something as time passing by? Maybe it doesn’t make any sense what I’m saying here, but just for you to know, this is me wondering about the nature of time. Welcome to my world.

And you know, this is what creativity is about. Showing up. I have been writing every day for 67 days, I have written around 300.000 words, some of which may not have sense at all, but they have been written anyways, and each and every time that I sit down to do it I have the feeling that I don’t know what I will write about. Each and every time is a new exploration into what is present in me in that moment, and I write from there. From that openness. From the place where each one of my cells is open to receive what the universe wants to bring. What life wants to bring. There is nothing like this feeling, because it is what brings joy into myself. It is the place where I connect to what is happening, to who I am in this particular moment, and that is one of the key aspects of what art is for me. It is a consequence. It is a manifestation. It is the means by which you can do the impossible thing of summarizing everything that you have been, everything that you have been, into something that didn’t exist before. It is the main driver of our actions.

I don’t know if I wrote about this in any other part of the book, I don’t think so, but when I was building my house each time that I went to the home store to get materials or stuff for the building process I thought to myself: Why does this place exist? Why do people come here to get things that they can put in their house if they already have -probably- their needs met and they don’t really need what is in here? Why is it that they come and spend their precious money in something that they don’t need for survival?

And that thought was anchored in the way of living that I used to have back then -part of it remains- that is that you only need what you need to survive and everything else is noise. I have been a minimalist and a person that doesn’t like to much to spend money in stuff because I used to think that if I need it is because there is an imbalance inside me that needs to be fixed in a different way than by buying stuff. And that was something huge in my life, the way on which I built my criticism to myself and how much I did not give me the opportunity for doing different things because of this way of thinking.

And the consequence of all these thoughts that I had when I went to the store was that they did it because of the need for creating. For transforming. Transforming the place where you live and having something new in there is something that brings a lot of joy into people’s life, and that’s why it was so exciting for this people. For all of us. The act of creation transforms yourself. It is not only that it transforms the place that you are acting upon, it is by that act that you are transformed. It is a big joy in our life as human beings, and that is what I want to bring more of to the world. I know that the future belongs to creators, and I want to help more and more people to tap into that void that comes when you are facing the blank page and you don’t know what to write about. I’ve been there, and it is a brutal thing that you have to go through. That is part of what has me here, staring at this page every day, and witnessing what comes each time after I decide to start. It is an exploration, but it is always facing that black page which brings this exploration about. If it was not because of that page I would not know how to approach it, what to do.

It used to happen to me last year when I was developing The Open Source Factory, project on which I built one web application every month, with the goal of working on it 4 hours every day. Some days I was not able to put in the hours, others I was, but I remember always having that feeling of not knowing what the fuck to do after I started a new project. I spend a few days thinking about what I would do, navigating that void of not knowing how to make progress, and it was hard. But the consequences of that were that I was bringing something original, something new, and that is the important aspect of it. That is the joy of what building a new thing is. That is what building brings into the world, and I know that eventually we will all feel that. May it be with a business, with a personal brand, with a book, with whatever. But the consequences of it are very deep, and here I am exploring into myself so that I can better understand how to bring that about in the life of others. How can I be that inspiration?

Where did my journey as a creator start?

I don’t even know. I can’t spot a particular moment of my life, because I’ve always had something different inside, a slight criticism towards the way on which life has been working until now, and in that sense, there has always been a drive in me to change the way on which things work. And from there, I kept evolving, following my internal drive, following the passion of exploring more and more who I am in the depth. And it is brutal, you know. Right now, as I write this, there is a sensation in me that tells me: Am I just wasting my time? Is it that I’m doing this to escape something? There is a slight sense of boredom inside, of sleepiness, and a part of me tells me: Is this resistance of is it that I truly don’t enjoy doing this? All those are the voices that I have inside, and with those authorities I have to deal with every day. It is part of how this game is played, eventually. That’s why you’ve got to show up, because there are going to be days on which you won’t want to do it, you won’t want to show up, and in those days is when the biggest learning can happen. That’s the thing. You’ll never know when the most important thing of your career will happen, so you’ve just got to show up. With your truth. With what is present that day.

I guess that something that brought a lot of my passion and commitment to the exploration of creativity as a pursuit for myself is the fact that I realized that it was free. It is something that is inside all of us. It is similar to the breath, or fasting. Those are things that we can do without having to buy anything that we don’t have yet, they are just there for us to explore. And that is amazing for me, because I see it as a way forward in a world where there is such inequalities as the one on which I live right now. I want to bring more and more stuff that is free, that each and every human being in the world can be a part of. I remember the criticism to myself because of being an engineer of the best school on Chile. There is something there that is only available for those that are privileged enough to be born in a family that has enough money to send the kid to a school where they can teach them the proper skillset to get into that career path, and I hate that about modern society. I think that we should live in a world where each of us should have the same opportunities, and this sense, the creative path opens up the opportunities for each of us. Because it doesn’t matter were you were born, it just matters the amount of presence that you are bringing to the creative act. Because eventually, you are doing it for yourself, to transform yourself, to become more of who you truly are, and each time that you sit and Do The Work is a moment on which you open up the door for this transformation to happen.

In the future, there won’t be any of the boundaries that are in place right now related to where the people will be able to go because of the place they were born. That is something great about anonymity. It doesn’t matter how old are you. It doesn’t matter what you have been throughout your life. The color of your skin. The family where you were born. The only thing that matters is what you bring into the game, and that game is the one that we are here learning how to play. The one of becoming no one, to be in service for life itself. Not for the institutions that you have been part of before, not for anything of the past. Just for what comes next, just for the collective. There may be a person that reads this that is involved in politics that may frame me as a Marxist or whatever. I don’t really know what that means anyway. I just think that each of us should have the opportunity to bring our truth into the world no matter where we come from, and I see that the technologies that are being built right now open up the door for this to happen. I want to live in a world where my daughter has opportunities because of who she is, not because of who I am. I’m just the vehicle that will show her the world, but what she does from there is a consequence of her own and unique genius, not mine.

That is a shift in perspective that is huge related to the one that I was raised in, and that shift is built upon my own relationship with myself. I know that a lot of old people value themselves, and the status that they have in relationship with the people that they are friends with, because of the goals and stuff that their children have achieved. It is a major predictor of who you will be in adulthood who you make your children to be. For a person it is much better -in the eyes of her pairs- to say that her children is an engineer from the best school in the world, instead of being an artist. But that is going to change, and I will not value myself in relationship to my daughter. I try to do that even now. There are times on which I have seen myself put in front of a conversation with another person how cool my daughter is, and this is also an expression of what I’m talking about. It is not only about the degree that they go and get in university, it is also about the present of them.

If I talk to others with the coolness of my daughter on the middle and I pride myself for being a good person because of her behaving how she behaves, I’m also full of shit. And I don’t want to live like this, and until now I have been able to witness that in many of my interactions. That is why it is so cool to interact with other people with my girl, because with that I’m better able to witness how I behave with them, and in that, learn about myself and my priorities and what I bring into the world. What is it that I want to bring into the world? That is the big question, and the one that is being answered day after day as I interact with every human being that I interact. With every moment of my life. It is a constant playground, and I’m just here in the background of it sitting back and enjoying the show.

I hope that I could be completely clear and sincere about that, but I’m not yet. There are still a lot of factors in my life that don’t let me sit back and enjoy, and I’m just here exploring them every day so that I can better understand and witness my truth. It is a constant exploration, a constant becoming, and I’m here just to do that. To become.

What will I become? I truly don’t know. I don’t have any clue. Maybe the application that I sent yesterday to become a founder of a startup is accepted, and because of that I can start my journey there. Maybe I end up writing a book of my family. Maybe I end up building the music store in my city. Who knows. But those are all external manifestations that are built because of the drive that I have inside. And which is the source of that drive? Who is the one that is in command? How will my relationship with that who is in command evolve now that I’m going through this process of awakening? Is it that every time that I talk about going through this process I go a bit further from it? What is my relationship with the process when I write about it? Is it normal to write about it? Should I do it?

And the fact that the word came right now is the perfect example of the effect that it has, and where does it come from. It comes -at least in this example- from a place of wanting to reach something. From a place of wanting things to be different. And we already should know that this whole awakening process is not about bringing something new that was not before there. It is about just manifesting what is there, what has always bee there. So I n tat sese it is very important to go through this process of writing, because with the words that come up I better understand the relationship that I have with myself and with everything that I’m going through. I am, therefore I write. That should be the motto for this whole thing. The eternal rant. So many ways on which I could talk about it. So many things that have been said. If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did it make any noise? That is the one that comes right now. I don’t even know if it is like that, but it is the one that came, as that, and I’m thinking: If I write 400.000 words and no one ever reads them, did I read them?

And the fundamental part of the answer to that is: which is the consequence that it has to write all those words, and to bring out of me everything that is present in them? Is it a consequence that is produced in the moment on which someone reads it, or is it a consequence that is created in the moment that it is written? I know that it is the latter, but I truly don’t know how to frame that towards something that makes sense to myself. Because right now as I write, the impact in myself of the words being written is unclear. If you come to me and tell me: What has been the impact of writing all what you have written? I wouldn’t know. There is a big drive in myself to do it, and a deep belief that it is what I have to do right now, but there is not clarity related to the impact that it has in myself. It is just something that needs to be done, and in the moment that I connect with that necessity of knowing what is the impact that it will have I end up in the trap of productivity and wanting to do everything in life because it will have a consequence downstream.

And that is toxic, because the act of creation will be poisoned by that. By definition, you can’t be in full presence if you are thinking about the consequences that your presence will have. It just doesn’t work like that. The aspects of mind that are in charge of building that relationship are not active in the moments on which you are in full presence, because mind is not active. There is just being. Just creation for the sake of it. Have I been able to be in that place for the most of the writing of this book? The authorities inside my mind tell me that I haven’t, that I have not been readily available for it and that sometimes I am distracted. But then I go to that part that knows and I ask that part and it just smiles and frowns the smile to the side like thinking: ‘You already know, why are you asking that question?

So that is the noise that is going on. Time to take a rest.

Some deep aspects of the unconscious, when they are coming, manifest themselves as sleepiness. Is this my truth or I’m just parroting what I read and don’t completely understand yet. I won’t go into that avenue, it doesn’t make sense right now. I just brought it because I feel sleepy, in spite of having slept 9 hours yesterday. Maybe, as Yogananda would say, ‘I drugged myself with too much sleep’. It is just what it is, I allowed myself to do it because I was tired, and I’m going through a lot. It’s just part of it, you know. I won’t try to make sense of it in any way, just accept it as part of what is present right here, right now.

I honor it, and I embrace it. I told myself that I would stay away for a while from stimulating drinks (the one I drink a lot is mate), and it seems that I’m missing it a lot. It’s incredible how much one can end up needing something particular to work in some way. This is the substance that has been present for me, and what comes is all those moments on which I told myself that I would stop doing something -in the future- just to end up disappointed of myself because when the time came I was not able to do it. I just kept kicking the ball to the future, and it seems that this mate thing is just another aspect of it. If me wanting to quit something that does not good for my body but then needing anyway and coming back and realizing that I was not able to do what I intended.

This has been present in me a lot in the last year. I have told me many times to stop eating sugar, that this is the last one, and I have not been able to do it. It seems like always I end up coming back, and this is new information about myself. Everything is information, and in one aspect it may be overwhelming to live life like this, always looking for those aspects that can teach me something new, but on the other side it is just how it is. That’s how I work, that’s what is present in me, and it is just how it is. I embrace it and live with it. And make fun of myself. It actually ends up being funny how much I do it. One of the projects that I have in mind building is called ‘The last time’, and it is a place where you can come and write every time that you say “this is the last time that I X”. For example, “This is the last time I drink alcohol”. So each time you say that, and you actually do that which you are saying, you come here and report it. Report mindfully what is in you as you are doing, and through that, become more and more aware of which are the underlying aspects of what you do. There is in me the acknowledgement that it would be very valuable to come to this place and check out how often you say those kinds of things. How separate in time they are. With that information, a lot can be built. A picture of yourself and the relationship that you have with what you decide to do.

For example, right now I wonder how many times I said that I would quit sugar, and how many times I ate sugar. I’m sure that having all that information in that place would be, at least, fun.

Anyway, that comes to mind when I think about this mate thing, and telling myself that I should or not should do something. Because in many ways that website that I spoke about before is a testament to shouldding. I shouldn’t eat sugar, because it is bad for my health. But what happens with the underlying aspects of myself that I’m helping because of eating that sugar? What if I’m not able to deal with what I have to deal to end up with that activity. What if there is something that I need to do before so that I can cease the unconscious drive to actually eat sugar? That is the one that I have to work on, that is the hard one. The others are downstream from that.

And by reporting all of those elements as you do them you end up doing that psychological internal work of better understanding the drivers behind what you do. It is a deeper window into knowing yourself better, at least that is what I think right now.

It’s crazy how I work in this creative act, because I just end up writing without even realizing that I’m doing it. I come here and I don’t give myself time to think about what I will write. I just do it. That’s the level of stream of consciousness that I’m going through right now, and that is what I have been bringing to life all the last months. Just writing whatever is, without judgement, without caring if it is right or wrong.

As I write this, the tension inside my head is present. It is something as if it was a piece of paper that is being stretched from both sides, and one part of it is on top of my right eye and it goes all around my skull to end up on the back of my head, in the point where the skull starts. The medulla oblongata, which Yogananda would say is the place where the soul enters the body. According to him, that is the place where the seed of who we are is. When we start developing as a human being, we are just two cells that get together, the male and the female. This egg is the place from which life arises, and he says that that place is now in the medulla oblongata. So my whole system developed from there, and right now there is a special sensation coming from there and going all around my body towards the top of my right eye. There is also a sensation of tiredness present in the brain, as if the fight against this sensations stopping wants to end. But I wonder, what comes at the other side?

And also I wonder, how can I believe that the world will wake up if what needs to happen for that to happen is all the effort that I have put into it? But the one that believes that is the one that wants to wake up. The one that takes pride in all the effort, and finds the value of himself in this effort. “I am who I am because of the commitment to do the work.” That’s what is present as a egoistic thought when this comes to mind. But it won’t be like that. There is all this effort that I have to go through because I know the stuff, I’ve been there theoretically and it is just the frame of mind that I’m used to. It is not that I can get out of this maze on my own, I just need to push through it. The only way in is through, and because of the point where I am at, that is true. And I can’t escape, I can just deal with it and help the ones that will come afterwards to wake up through different means. I can’t expect people to do what I have done. It is not feasible. I’ll need to find other means, and those means will be in place in spite of what I think or do. They will just be. The aspect of myself that thinks that ‘it is my mission to build those systems’ is the one that wants to have the answers. It is the one that wants to control. It is the one that wants to be in charge. But you are not in charge, my friend. You are just a pawn in this universal game, and the more you embrace it, the more you become free from the burden of being someone specific in the game. The more you get released. And, the ironically, the consequence of that is that I will be more able to manifest more of this that I want to manifest. So yes, it is time to step aside and just let life do its thing. Through me. Let life live through me and just be a witness of how that unfolds.

Time to go back to the basics: the pomodoro timer. I just finished a 12 minute HIIT and I came back with the intention of going through my last DW session of today, and what came was the intention of doing it as a pomodoro session. When I started my coding journey I thought it would be great to bring it in so that I could just have a small section of time entirely devoted to my mission in that moment, and it worked wonders. What I truly like about it is the accountability aspect, and the fact that you take breaks so that you can allow yourself to think in something completely different on the meantime. This feels like something critical, and now I realize that I have not been able to be consistent with these breaks because of the push that I have brought to me related to the 4 hours of deep working. It is important to find a system that works for you, that helps you be accountable, and starting with the pomodoro timer for me was great. It truly helped me to become more used to the way on which I was doing things. And the good thing about it is that you only need 25 minutes. When I go into a DW session thinking that it will be 2 hours long it is quite a lot for my mind to grasp, and sometimes it brings to myself the feeling of not being enough because I was not able to go through it. But with 25 minutes you can fit that in every moment of the day, and that ends up being a relief. Maybe in the long term it is helpful for not burning out, but the downside of it that I found was that it cut in half very inspiring working sessions. And I ended up breaking the spell of them because of the breaks in between. Anyway, it is good to be back to it, because it is a tool, and tools need to be used in a way that bring value to your life.

If you don’t develop a healthy relationship with them and you start thinking that you are not good enough because of that, you won’t get anywhere. They are just tools, and they will do whatever the person that is using them wants to do. In this moment of history we have some of the most powerful tools ever available, and it is because of this that it is hard to get a grasp on how to use them properly. Distraction is a huge temptation, especially if what you are doing demands your focus, attention, and big effort. But the upside of going through that is huge. I can’t speak about that from experience, because everything that I have gone through doesn’t seem to pay dividends yet, but I’m working on it. And as soon as I say that it hasn’t brought dividends I ask myself: What are you expecting? You write about working without having in mind the consequences of your actions and then you write this? What are you trying to say?

I’m just saying that it is hard, you know? I have been more than two years now running on my own, running my own marathon, without almost anyone on the side telling me: Let’s go! You can make it! I’m running on uncharted waters, trying to bring more of something that is absolutely unusual for the environment on which I live in, and I haven’t seen the ‘results’ in a way that is concrete. And you may wonder: What can be more concrete than having written more than 1000 pages of this book. That’s the problem. I was raised with the understanding that every piece of feedback, every piece of praise, every piece of acknowledgement has to come from the outside. From the people that are next to me. From the ones that can talk about it. And the sole skill that I have been working on in this whole time since I started this game is trusting in myself enough so that I can pursue my dreams. That is the game I’m playing. That is the thing. I’m here, pushing through all the challenges (which are all in my own head, my own demons, my own internal authorities) and trying to find meaning and sense in all that. And it is like opening a hole in the wall of a prison with a spoon, you know? But if you saw The Shawshank Redemption, one of the most famous and better critizised films of humanity, the guy eventually escapes from prison after making that hole in the wall with the spoon. So yes, each time I show up, each time I come here to write on my own, to myself, is a little bigger spoonful. The one that will enable me to get out of the prison of my own head. Until I allow myself to become free from all those aspects of myself that tell me that I’m not worthy, I’m not good enough. I feel like I’m running against all the current of what I have been told in my life that works, and the interesting thing about it is that more and more people are doing it. And the internet connects us. I’m not alone in this quest. There are more and more humans that are realizing that what they have been told their whole life is not something that is the best for them in the long term, and in that realization, what comes is a willingness to explore an alternative. A different way. And that’s what we are building, without even knowing, each one of us that is showing up to Do The Work.

We have all been in service of the awakening of our species, we just didn’t know it yet. And now is the time. Now is when it will happen, it is all in stage, we are all here for it. Never in the history of humanity were there these many souls in this planet. The whole universe is watching. And it is watching me as I write each one of these 300.000 words, as I show up and share with whoever will read, in whatever moment of history, what I’m saying here. This is my truth, right here, right now, and the best of it is that I’m free of it. I can say tomorrow that I think something absolutely different from the world and from the evolution of our species and everything and I won’t have any problem about that. I’m not identified with anything, because at the end they are all concepts. They are all sets of thoughts and understanding that we have built together as humanity, but nothing is set in stone. And it certainly isn’t within me. I’m just exploring who I am, and in that sense, bringing everything of it into the table. I’m just here. Experiencing myself. Experiencing my truth, through each and every word that comes up. That’s the game that I set up to play, and here I am doing it. The universe is watching, each time that I sit down to Do The Work, through my own eyes. The universe is within myself, I am part of it, and it is just through this understanding that it will be able to realize its own existence. We are the means by which the universe becomes aware of itself. The universe, awareness, call it whatever you like, but we are in the point of history in which this happens. I can feel it with each cell of my body when I engage in life from a place of presence. I can unleash it in every word that comes from my heart. I can say it without any problem, because there is not an attachment inside me with these words. The only attachment is related to my commitment to Do The Work, and that attachment is built upon hours and hours and hours of sitting down to ask myself the question: What is real?

Until no one remains.

That is the endgame. That is where the extinction of our species starts. And that is the starting point of the new adventure, of the new world. A world that is built upon the collective intelligence that can be developed if we are able to transcend the limitations that our egoic nature pose into the way on which we relate with the world. It is time for us to wake up, to start witnessing the other as another aspect of myself. Of my truth. Each and every human being has her own truth inside. Which is the moment on which we will open up the door for that understanding to come through? It is time for us to wake up. Are you going to hop into the train? Are you going to be one of the early adopters of this new way of being?

Start by challenging each and every one of your assumptions of what is real. Start by being open to know nothing. Start by being open to live each moment of your life as if you were a toddler trying to make sense of everything that is happening around her. And better if you are not trying to make sense. Better if you are just experiencing, from your truth, whatever that may look like. Whatever that is. We all have our own truth inside, and in the recognition of that we can move forward into a new way of being. Into a new way of experiencing what is here, now. In every now that comes.

Time is just the construct over which the illusion of separation is built. What remains when there is no time anymore? Do you remember being a young child and playing so much that there was no time in your consciousness? That’s what comes when you are pure being. When you allow yourself to just be.

Allow yourself to just be.

Allow yourself the biggest present of your lifetime.

You just are.

That’s the endgame.

That’s when time stops.
