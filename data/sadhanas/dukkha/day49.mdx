Your ancestors had to go to war so that you could be here in this moment. Which is the war that you are going to fight so that your children can grow in the world that will help them thrive? Learn to die before you die, that is the biggest gift that you can give to the world.

I’m struggling big with the meditation practice, it is getting very intense, with a lot of strong sensations in the brain, and sometimes I think to myself that I’m harming my system because of all the pushing towards something that I want to stop pushing towards but don’t really know how. I don’t really know how to make the progress that I have to make. Do I really have to make some progress? Is that the truth? I remembered in one moment of the meditation to ask myself: What is true? And there was not clarity in the answer. I don’t really know what is true, I don’t really know what these sensations that I have inside are about, if they are good, or bad, they just are, and I try to accept them as much as I can. It is very intense.

But yesterday I found a book that spoke about the roman empire and because of it what came into my consciousness was the level of development that I am enjoying right here, right now, where I can go into twitter and be connected to the whole world in just one seconds. Yes, there is a threat of a nuclear war, but I don’t think that that is going to happen. I don’t think that that is the way on which this whole story ends. We live in a level of comfort that would be impossible to think about in the past, and that will keep being true for as long as there is a human being existing. I don’t even know what that means, because I don’t know where we are going as a species. Is this even going to end? But if time is a construct of mind, what does the end mean? Is it the transcending of mind? There are so many questions inside me, and stuff that is not clear, and movements that are going on in a very intense way, it is crazy. What is going on is very intense, and it is kind of sad because I don’t have anyone to talk to about it. It is just in the comfort of my own thoughts, of my own brain, of my own being, and it feels lonely. But it also feels like the best moment to go anon, because I feel that through that I’m going to be able to give my best to the world, without the attachments of having to be the one that I have been my whole life. It feels like starting a new life, one which will bring into my being the capacity of just bringing into the world what I want to bring, and putting my effort and energy in the causes that I want to support. That feels like a way of dying before I die. Being anon. Yes, it is in a way killing the story that I have told myself and offering it to the evolution of our species.

So I came with the intention of writing an email and ended up here again because there is no internet in the room. And that is me procrastinating, because, what does it matter that there is no internet if I’m just going to write something? Do I really need internet for writing something? I’m writing this without internet. There’s your answer. The thing is that what I write here is just a rant that ends up being a conversation with myself, one on which I just explore what comes. And is that valuable for someone? Will someone ever be so lost that she comes here to look for the answers to what is going on in her life? I don’t think so. Yesterday I went to a bookstore and realize how much of an incredible journey it is to write a book. It is a massive undertaking. Imagine all the book that exists, and I’m writing this one with the hope that there will be someone that grabs it and wants to read it in the future. I hope for it to be on top of the shelf of ‘reading’ in the mind of some random person in the world, that doesn’t even know me. Is that something that can be possible? Is that something that can happen? Probably not. And that lets me stay with the question of what is it for. Why am I writing this book, since 49 days ago. Is it for hiding? Is it for developing the means of exploration of my own being through the writing? Who do I write for? It is for myself. It is a necessity. It is not something that I choose to do, it is something that has chosen me. It is the means by which I explore what comes, through each of the words that show up. It is the way on which I better understand who I am, and that is all that matters. Because by being who I am I’m able to share myself. To express myself. And that is the game. That is what comes.

I wanted to write this book as a story, the story of an alien that came to the world and started having an amazing human experience, but realized that I was not going to be able to because it doesn’t flow like that. As I started writing from the perspective of a third person, it felt weird. I did not feel comfortable with it. So I had to stop. It feels much more comfortable to just express myself from the position of myself, because that is the one that is speaking. The aspect of myself that is beyond the thoughts, beyond the story that I have told me. I am all those stories, and much more. And that is what shines through what comes. And that is the magic about this whole thing, this whole game, this whole writing adventure. I’m here, doing my thing, exploring what comes, because it is just what I have to do. It is my mission in this place. To put everything down into words and share it with who reads. And I will develop a system to summarize it. That is the core mission of what I will bring here. I will develop an AI program that will summarize everything that I write into something that can be readed in a predefined amount of time. Do you have only 4 minutes for reading today? Ok, I’ll summarize it for you. That is the next generation of books, the next generation of how we will write. The AI will do the editing, and it is just my mission to be able to create that system.

I guess that this whole game that I’m playing here is related to who I am when I give myself the permission to be consistent. I have not been able to build up that space for myself, not at all, but it is just part of the game that I have been playing until now, ups and downs, motivations and non-motivations. They come and go. It would be nice to have a full on motivation journey on which I was able to just show up with whatever it takes every day and push through it, but it hasn’t been that the case. What ends up happening is that I do a or b and end up in another place, sharing another thing, being with another people, doing the father thing. Life always puts itself in the middle. And there goes that battle inside myself, asking me: Am I facing this or am I just avoiding what comes by thinking that there is something else that I should do? There comes that word again, should. Should I write every day to become really good at it? Should I read? Should I share my work? Should I transition into a new way of being through the writing alone? I don’t really know, and it is part of the game. It is part of what is being created here, through me, and I don’t really know how to monetize it yet and be good at it enough so that people pay me in a consistent basis, but I’m getting there. I know I’m getting there. And the only way to truly get there is to show up, and I need to show up more and more so that the cool stuff can come up. So that I can be the one that I can be. So that I can share what I have for sharing. That is all the game that is being played here, and it is time for me to embody it in a deeper way. Just go with it, just play the game, just do it. They are all watching. Every person that my grandmother talks about is watching. All my family is watching. My little girl is watching. We are all watching, and it is happening.

Tomorrow I’m coming back to the podcast, interviewing a person that follows me on Twitter, and I feel very excited about it. The fact that I can talk to a human being that I don’t know from beforehand brings a lot of joy to myself, and that is what I see myself doing in the future. Bringing more and more of this energy into the world, the energy of celebration, of humans doing their thing, of us just being ourselves. I’m building the internet’s radio station, and in that spirit it is important that I continue with the mission that I have commanded. Share what is there, share what I come up with, and move forward with the story that is behind the project. Each person shares a piece of music from the heart. Each person is a unique light that shares a piece of music from the heart, and tomorrow I’m going to enter into the space of that person by listening to what he shared. And talk with him about it. Whatever comes, I’m thinking for these to just be conversations that you could have in a festival, as you walk by a random stranger. Systems, that is everything that I need to put in place so that I can thrive in the execution of them. I’m a very creative person, with a lot of ideas, and as long as I put the systems in place I’m going to be able to execute them more efficiently. For example, the last 5 days I have not uploaded the writing of that day to the internet, and that means that I will have to do them all in a bulk. Wouldn’t it be better if I just did it every day after ending the writing session of that day? Of course, but I have not done it because I have not done a proper session in those days. All these days have felt like I have not done enough, so I leave it open so that I can come afterwards and continue with what is missing.

And that speaks about the lack of systems. Yes, I have not been able to put them in place. But I will, everything that I’m doing here is walking towards that state of having them in place. Realizing that each system is just a vehicle for creativity to shine through. And I want that creativity to shine through my words, my actions. I want to be able to tell those stories through my words. Is it that people don’t read anymore? I don’t think so. I just think they like reading in another way, and it is time for me to be able to distill everything that I am in a new way of reading, in a new way of creation. Until now, you wrote a book because it was the only way on which you could bring what you are to the world. But what if that book is the expression of everything that you are, and you are able to convey that into different forms of sharing it? I can create a blog post, an intagram post, a tiktok reel, a bunch of tweets, etc. All from just the writing of one day. Until now, today, I have written 2103 words. Isn’t that valuable? Is there not enough information in there for being able to create a shitload of content? I do think this is true, and it is just a matter of me being able to build the correct system so that I can share it in a meaningful way. What is it that I want to bring into the world? How do I want to convey everything that is inside me? I need AI to help me. I need a personal assistant. And I need to code that assistant myself. My own personal writing assistant. The one that will filter out the noise, so that I can just focus on writing. What ends up coming at the other side is not my problem, it is a consequence of what is going on. It is a consequence of what people will like. It will be a constant iteration. I write 4 hours every day, then filter it through the assistant, and at the other side comes something that is suited for that particular individual. That is magic. That is something that truly can happen, and that is going to happen. Whatever I want to build, I will be able to. And it is time to dream, because those dreams will become true.

The future is absolute expression of human potential, and that potential is creativity. Is just coming up with what wants to come up. And for me, writing has been about this all this time. Just staring at this screen and sharing what is inside me. The cool thing about it is that I don’t need to have an internet connection to do it. I can go to the forest and show up in there and write as I connect with the energy that the trees are giving me. I can go anywhere and write from there. Or, I can just sit down at my computer and share the words with the screen. It doesn’t truly matter. What matters is just that I’m able to show up and give it a try. And this image is amazing, the one that I’m witnessing right now. Me, sitting at the desk, with the computer in front and the music coming out of this machine. I wonder if my great-grandfather would have ever dreamt about something like this happening. Of course not. It is impossible to predict what will be created in the future. It just happens. And for me, it is just happening also. What is being created is being unleashed as we speak, without a clear understanding of the means by which it is happening. It just happens. And that is the magic. That is the gift that this day and age brings to us. And you want to better know what will happen in the coming years? Good luck with that. You won’t. No one will. The only thing that I’m able to predict is that all of us will interact with life from a different perspective than that which we have until now. As I write these words, most of humanity relates to their experience as a human being from the perspective of the biological sense of ‘I’. The construct that is a consequence of a lifetime embodying a particular human being, with all the experiences that build up that character. You go through a particular childhood, which ends up having a set of consequences for the way on which you perceive the world. You filter it through the lens of your senses, and evolution has given that toolkit to your experience as a human being. But we are in the verge of a deep transformation that is taking place, and this transformation involves a shift in the way on which you relate to the world. Where does your sense of ‘I’ arise from. Until now it has been identified and associated with the character that you play, but what will happen in the coming years is that more and more people will wake up to the fact that this is a reduction valve that biology gave us as the means for surviving, and we don’t need it anymore. We don’t need to survive anymore. There are no threats in the worlds besides those of our own mind. And this is the fundamental difference that happens now related to most of human history. Before, you had to take care of yourself so that you could not be killed. Now, you probably won’t be killed, so the threat is only inside your own mind. We all run through the maze of our own mind. That’s why depression is at all time highs, specially with children that are part of what they call ‘gen-z’.

Depression is a consequence of a over identification with the role that ego plays in the development of human beings. As you get more and more identified with the character that you are playing, you anchor more and more of your ‘being’ into that character. And that is what is going to shift in the coming years, because that being is everything BUT reduced to that particular character. You are way more than what you think you are, you just don’t know it yet. And as more and more people realize that, more and more will be able to come out of that place of ‘non-truth’. More and more people will realize the fact that the only way out of their own minds is by realizing that they are more than it. And it is part of the arc of our development. On one side we have our parents that sold until the last drop of their life force to create the wealth of the world on which we live in, and on the other side we have the coming generations that will be the ones that use all that was created in the benefit of building a new world. But the transition will be hard, because there are many systems in place that make us feel that all what is going on is a constant battle. And it definetly feels like that somedays, on which there are catastrophes that shake the entire industry that is trying to build a new alternative. I’m talking about the whole crypto industry, and what happened the last days with the implosion of a trading company called FTX. I don’t want to get into specifics right here, because I don’t have the information and knowledge to do it. On some moments of my life I would have felt bad about that, but right now I just feel free. Free from having to be someone, free from having to have that information inside. Free from the shoulds. I don’t need to know. It is not the role that I play in this game. The one that I play is that of a watcher, of the one that is silent on the side building up the strength to take over by offering a true alternative to what is going on. I know that I have walked the steps towards the real alternative, and that is what I’m exploring every day with the things that I do.

The future is related to stuff that is not done with money. Those are the most important gifts that life gives us. Fasting and meditation. Having a conversation with a random stranger. The tools of the future are those that don’t need a particular way of doing things in the background. They are the ones over which life just expresses itself. That is the magic. The magic is what comes from the exploration of what just is. Without the complexities of having to become ‘better at something’ so that you can embody it more. You just become better at it by doing it more often. By loosing yourself in the practice, in the creative act. I become better at writing because I do it more and more. And it is not that I become better at writing. What have I become better at in the last years? At focus. I become better at focus by just being more focused, by sitting down and Doing The Work with everything that I am, acknowledging the moment of my life on which I’m at, and giving everything of what I am to what is going on right here, right now. Tomorrow I have a podcast, and I don’t have anything more to do to prepare to it than just being myself. I will bring all of what I am to that conversation, as if it was the first one. Beginners mind. If I read about the guest, I will have a preconception of what will happen. If I don’t I will just flow with what happens, and that is the whole magic of the thing. Listen to the album together, and explore what it brings. Explore what comes from the flow of the consciousness of two human beings sharing a space together. That is everything that I need. That is everything that the other person needs. No more, no less. That is the magic. The magic is just coming together to explore.

I spend so much time trying to bring it to other place. For example, what happened with my parents the other day. We were having a conversation and I secretly was expecting it to bring us somewhere. To have a deep, meaningful conversation that transformed the whole relationship that we have with each other because of the depth of what was talked. And that is a mirage. That is a nonsense. That is me, trying to build a reality different from the one that is right in front of me. That is me not accepting the reality that is just in front of me. And the same happens with my guests. If I try to be more of what I am, I will end up being fake. I’m just what I am, and the more I’m able to embody that the more I will be who I am. And that is perfect as it is. That is everything that is needed. No more, no less.

The truth is that the more able that I am to develop the capacity to be present, the more efficient I will be with my life force. By being present I bring everything that I am into the aspects of my being that are just here, right now, and that is all what I need to just be. That is the magic. Create something so good that people can’t help to want more of it. And that is just me. I will build myself into something so good that people just want more of it.

And that is built on top of gratitude. The gratitude for being able to sit down and write these words. To be in front of this miracle that is the computer, breathing this miracle that is the air that comes from the miracle that is my nose, starting at the screen from the technological miracle that my eyes are, witnessing the miracle that the grass that is growing besides me is, experiencing the miracle of the moving clouds in the sky, with the constant willingness to rain that they have present right now. The miracle of them wanting to rain. The miracle of nature, the miracle of the music that I’m listening, the miracle of the people which built the office on which I’m sitting down to write another day, the miracle of my daughter smiling to ourselves in the morning, the miracle of her first steps, and the miracle of her first words. The miracle of the book that I read yesterday, and all of the words that that person wrote in there. The miracle of the flowers that are blooming in the garden of my grandmother, and the miracle of the people that have been part of my life. The miracle of my parents, and how they went through all the challenges that they did in order to be able to give birth to me. The miracle of the 31 years that I have been in this world, navigating it and bringing out of every experience what it gives to me. The miracle of the love that is there with my wife, which a lot of times is hard for us to witness but it is there, latent, waiting to shine. Waiting for us to leave our shit on the side and just express it to each other. The miracle of being able to connect our two bodies and experience the deepest pleasure that I have felt, by bonding them together in the magical moment of union that has as a consequence a new human being. The miracle of the flesh, the miracle of the human body. The miracle of how I grew from a single cell, from the mix of two different cells that came together and started developing from there. The miracle of life. The miracle of life. The miracle of intelligence, and the miracle of the development of consciousness. Of the embodiment of consciousness. The miracle of every mystery that is in place. The miracle of life. The miracle of being here, writing this words, just expressing myself into what comes. The miracle of this presence, that has been witnessing life through these eyes all this time. The miracle of awakening, that is what comes next. The miracle of consciousness realizing itself through me. The miracle of me paving the road for those who will come next. The miracle of me accepting that I’m absolutely lost, but just trusting in what comes next. The miracle of accepting that being lost is the highest form of freedom. The miracle of opening myself to the unknown, to realize that it is the coziest place where to be. The miracle of just being. The miracle of just being. The miracle of just being. The miracle of just being. The miracle of just being. Just being. Just being. Being. The miracle of just being. Thank you life, for letting me just be. Thank you life, for everything that has come up in this experience as a human being. I’ve tried my best. I’m here, again, showing up for you to teach me what I need to learn so that I can be a little bit more present right here, right now. Not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow. Just here, just now. Each time is a new time, each moment is a new adventure. This game is just played constantly, eternally, and that is the magic of it. That is what comes. Every moment as a new exploration into what can be. Every moment as a new way of being. Every moment as a new experience. Every moment is a new moment. Every moment has its own magic. Just be free with it. Just appreciate it for what it is. That’s all what is needed.

Holy shit, it is amazing how much I have to say. It never ends. I’ll never end throwing out words into the void, the only thing that I need is my assistant to be able to help me to translate them for the general world. I just need more people to be able to read this maze, so that they can feel identified by it, so that it can help them grow. Is that even necessary? I don’t even know. I just write, I just do my thing, and from there evolve into what comes next. That is the whole game I’m playing. Right here, right now. The rest is the magic that comes when there are no expectations of something being different from what it is. This is everything that is. This moment is the sum of everything that has come before, and it is perfect like this. It is perfect to watch my reflection on the screen of the computer and be there, smiling, and congratulating myself with: You made it. You are here. You are. That’s everything that will ever be. Just being. They all knew it, it has always been known. We are. We will ever be.

The distance between me and the experience that I’m having and what is being experienced is just a construct of my mind. It is just a consequence of navigating the world from the perspective by which I have always navigated it. What happens when that perspective is shifted, transformed, evolved? Or involved? It there an evolution to take place? I don’t really know. What I know is that there is a deep aspect of myself that wants to be expressed through each one of my actions, and I’m doing my best to be able to do that. To explore into what comes when I substract myself from the equation. Me minus me. What remains? What is present when there is no me? All what is. All what has ever been. All what will ever be. That is the game that we are playing here. That is the magic. That is the ruler that will command the aspects of myself that are going to navigate the future, each future. The future is the pure expression of creativity, and I’m here to help you bring it forth. I’m here to help you navigate your world. I’m here to help you become who you can become by expressing every part of your creative being. I’m here to help you trust in yourself. I’m here to help you become more of yourself, by helping me become more of what I am. I am help. I am you. I am the aspect of yourself that doesn’t trust himself enough, and I’m here to acknowledge that aspect and make it part of every part of what you do. You won’t get rid of it. It is not the game. The game is to integrate it, and to act in spite of it. It is to deeply acknowledge that it is the motor, the fuel, the thing that is behind the fear. It is the acknowledgment that fear is part of the human experience, that it is what constitutes us, what defends us, what helps us be who we are. But it is not what defines us. We are not that fear. You are what comes out of facing that fear. You are what is at the other side. You are the magic that comes from witnessing that fear and not being identified by it. You are the magic. You are the rose that is waiting to blossom. You are the blossoming of that rose. You are the magic that comes from that blossoming. You are the ideas, and the execution of those ideas. You are everything. You are what you are. Not more, not less. You are what you are, and you are what you have always been. That is the magic of the game, just being who you have always been and you have not been able to witness it because of all of that noise. Give up the noise. Integrate it. Make it part of the experience. It is part of the experience. And move on through it. The only way in is through.

Through the noise.
Through the pain.
Through the silence.
Through the fear.
Through the act of creation.
Through the unresolved experiences.
Through the being.
Through the information.
Through the noise.

The only way in is through. To go through the gate you have to be no one. Be no one, by learning to die before you die. Kill yourself in the act of creation, by becoming it. Transforming all your experience into what is being created. Dissolve those aspects of yourself that believe that they are in command, and just set them free. Give up the willingness to be in charge. Be free. Be free from the burden of being in charge of what is the consequence of your actions. Just act. Just be. Just let the world do its thing. Just explore into what comes. The rest will be a consequence of this. That is what beginners mind is all about. You don’t know what will happen, you don’t know what will come up, and that is perfect. That’s the joy of being alive. Giving yourself the space for just explore what is there.

Life is a state of mind. That is the thing. Life is a state of mind. Which is your state of mind right now, as you read these words? How can I help? Do you need help? That is the mission that I’ve had since the dawn of time, since I have memory. How can I help? How can I be in service? That is what always runs through myself. Just wanting to be in service, and building everything that I do, all the tools that I come up with, all the tools that I develop into that. It is the magic. It is the dream. Building something that is just helpful. Useful. And what comes from there is the collective consciousness of all the people that are being part of it at the same time. That is the magic of the festival. All the people gathering together to be there, to enjoy, to witness. All the people being part of it, at the same time. And that is what the radio is about. Bringing people together to a shared space. That is something that is not present in any streaming service. You just listen to what you want to listen, and there is no aspect of community built within the platform for that to happen. And that is what I want to bring into the world by doing what I will do. Just sharing with it what will come. What will be there for all of eternity. Until now, human music has been running around for as much as 3 years, and it is the consequence of my creation. It is my child, and now it is time to evolve it. And this is the way on which it evolves, by sharing it with the world. By opening up the creative part of myself that just wants to be there for the world, and showing up. Sharing me. Sharing what is there with the world. Holding the space. That is what I love doing, to hold space. That is what I bring into the world. The holding of space. The being there for others.

I’m developing this whole thing so that I can be there for others. That is the thing that will bring more joy into my being. Just being there for others. Just feeling that they know that they are not alone. And that is all. I’m building a system, and it is very important to have the long term in mind. The big picture. The image that will drive the actions of what is going on in here. Am I the alien that came to the earth to wake humans up? Am I the alien that came here to explore all of what humans are by consuming their content? Am I the alien that is here just being another one? How do I share that story with the world? By being sincere. What did that piece of content bring into myself? What is present in me because of it? How does it resonate? How does it speak to who I am? That is the magic. That is what will come. That is what I will write about, and it will never stop. It will be an eternal exploration into the state of art of what is being created by humans, because every creation (if done with intention) is just that, the state of the art of the creator. You can’t hope to create something better, or different, because it is just what it is. And it is perfect like that. How can this alien become more of itself by consuming all that content? Which is the system that I’m going to create for all of this to happen? That is the magic. That is the activity. That is what comes at the other side. Me just being who I am, and sharing that with the world. But not from the egoic perspective of ‘me’, but from the perspective of ‘it’. Who is this alien? Why is it here? Which are its motivations? What does it have inside? Where is it heading?

I just read a book from a person that speaks from the perspective of an alien, and it didn’t resonate because it is just an outline of ‘what can be better’, from the perspective of the alien. But what it brings to me is the questioning of: How does he know what is better? How does he know which is the correct way of action? How does he know how we should make progress? What is the driver of those actions? It is not clear for me, and that is something that I have to have in mind for when the time comes for me to be the one that is sharing the story of that alien. How does each piece of content evolve his perspective of humanity? Does this even make sense? Who is this alien? What is he doing here? Just exploring what humanity is building. Creating. It is a consumer of what we create, and the infinite jest is the perfect frame of reference for it to do its thing. Each day he will come at the same time and watch the piece of content that is there. And then he will write whatever comes up in 88 minutes and that will be the food of thought of that day. That will be the consequence of what the piece of content will bring into its awareness, into its way of witnessing the world. Our world. Our world is built upon the content that we share, and the stuff that we create for expressing ourselves. This is the purest way of sharing that we have. How does it impact an outsider? Can I position myself from the perspective of this outsider? Am I the outsider? If I come here every day with beginners mind, I can be the outsider. I can put myself on those shoes. It is just up to me. And this is one of the systems that I need to have in place. Probably the most important one. I keep thinking if I should build a company, or this, or that, but I’m not sure about it. It doesn’t feel comfortable to me to manage people. To be in charge of them. Let them do their thing, and let me be free. I just want to be free.

Another day of showing up to do the work, and another day of just setting the monster that I have inside free. It will never end. It is not something that one day I will come and say: Ok, the monster is freed, I’m ready. Nope, it doesn’t work like that. It just means that every day is a new adventure, a new exploration, and the curiosity that comes from that willingness to explore what comes is everything that it takes. And it has been the mindset that I have had in the times that I come and sit down and do the work, and it is something that is forgotten when I don’t do it. Sometimes I forget. It is easy for me to forget it, because life puts in the way. I’m a father now, I have different responsibilities, which can be hard to deal with. But that is the magic. The magic of being in here, part of this maze of mind, exploring what comes from every experience that I go through. Melting my reality into what is in here, right now. Melting what I have done throughout my life so that it can inform everything that I’m doing right here, right now. Just being present. Just being presence. Just being, everything that I am. Right here, right now. This is everything that I have on offer. Leave it, or take it, it is your decision, but I did my work. I came here, I showed up, and that is all what matters. The rest is just a story.
