It is so easy for me to take for granted everything. I take for granted my parents, my wife, my little girl, my own life, and each small piece of what I do in it. I take for granted the effort that I do every day to try to bring a little bit more of consciousness to the world, I take for granted my capacities, I take for granted what I have done, and I take for granted the world in which I live. And the consequence of that taking for granted is an incapacity for bring grateful and to embrace what is, just as it is. It is an incapacity to congratulate myself for what I have done. It is an incapacity to be the one that acknowledges the ones that are around me, and that expresses that acknowledgements as words that can make the life of that person a different adventure. It is my incapacity for realizing the power that lies within me, that one that is waiting to be manifested on each circumstance, on each moment of my life. I am pure potential (you are too), and when I take things for granted I forget this and I go into the void of just looking for what is missing, instead of appreciating what is actually there. Why is it so hard to be grateful for what I have? Why is it so ease for me to see what is missing? I go through this question a lot, and that going for it comes from my mind, from my willingness and wanting to know. What happens when I let go of that willingness to know why it is like that and I just let those sensations be? What comes when I truly feel that there is something missing? How does that inform myself, and the relationship that I have with my life? That is something that can be very valuable to my experience, and the power of just sitting back and being the witness is always there, speaking to me.

Yesterday was a very important day, because I realized that all the unconscious aspects of myself that are part of the way on which I interface with reality, the deepest ones, are going to be manifested as reflections. Reflections and projections. Each time that there is something that triggers me from what happens in the outside, from what someone does, that is a reflection of an experience in my childhood that was not completely integrated and it is being manifested in my life right now as something unconscious because all those memories were stored in me as emotional imprints. They are not images, or visions, or stories to be told. They are stored in the emotional body, and the way on which they express so that I can process them is via the interaction that I have with the world. And each time that I engage in one of these reflections I’m projecting part of my unconscious experience into the world. But each one of these circumstances on which I’m triggered is actually the means for going deeper in the exploration of myself, of my relationship with what is going on inside me. And I have been able to see that in my life lately. 

This last year whenever I have a discussion with my partner there is a big pressure in the area of the third eye, which I always have experienced as something that is trying to bring some information to me but I have not been able to realize what it is. Maybe it is related to this, it is my third eye telling me: this is the moment on which you can integrate all those experiences from your childhood. You won’t be able to remember them, it doesn’t work like that, but you will be able to be the sovereign of what comes up next. You will be able to show up for yourself, and use this moment as the means for going deeper into the exploration of what it means to bring into the conscious aspect of your being something that was unconscious. And that is the process, more and more, of releasing all those unconscious aspects of my experience in life. And before yesterday I did not have a clear understanding of this whole process, but now I do, because I’m able to realize better the relationship between the different stages of life and how it impacts the way on we develop as human beings. The first 7 years are connected to the emotions, the second 7 years are connected to the development of the mind, and the third 7 years are connected to the development of the body. What an amazing journey, it is just astonishing. I’m amazed by every part of it, in awe, and I love the opportunity that I have to be alive. To be exploring this experience, and getting to know more and more about myself in the process.

Life is the adventure of understanding of which is your relationship with reality. Every moment is a window into that, and everything that happens to you, each part of your relationship with life, can be the means by which you better understand what that relationship is. It is truly a game, and we are here to play it. To sit back and enjoy the show that is going on in front of our eyes. Every day I learn a little bit more about it, by being the witness of my own experience, and it is amazing. 

And about my meditation process, what can I say. It is getting more and more intense. I’m doing 15 minutes of conscious connected breathing and then 45 minutes of meditation, and I feel as if there was something that was moving inside me and wanting to be expressed by I’m not able to allow it, not ready yet, I don’t know. I was a bit anxious about this moment because I really want to explain in a way that makes sense what is going on inside my system when I sit down and meditate, but I don’t seem to have the capacity. What comes is a very strong sensation in the forehead, between the eyebrows, in the area of the third eye. There are parts of it where I see myself trying to ‘gather energy’ there so that something can happen and that is the moment on which I give myself the permission to let go. So I spend the whole time in this wack-a-mole game, of realizing that there is a slight tension inside and releasing. That there is a certain craving for something specific to happen, and then I released. My scientific mind had the idea that my pineal gland is useless because of all the alcohol that I drank when I was younger, and that’s why I find it so hard to explore what is inside. I mean, I can do it, don’t get me wrong, but it is very hard to describe what is going on. I explore it by being the witness of it, all the time. I’m just there, witnessing things happening, and trying my best to let go of the willingness for something specific to happen.

Because I truly think, feel and know that something is going to happen. And the biggest information that I have related to something happening is the fact that this thing that I’m going through can’t go forever. It just doesn’t seem as a possibility, because there is so much going on, mainly in the physical level. I mean, there is a big aspect of myself that is acting weird in the emotional side, not really knowing how to relate to circumstances as the one of yesterday, but what I read yesterday about the emotional imprints being manifested for my integration in my outside world as reflections as been hardcore training material. The whole world becomes a training ground, and I have been wanting that to happen for a long time. I truly want to experience life from how it feels to be ‘working’ 24/7. And what does is just being present. That is the question: When you wake up, is it that you have to do any effort for something? How can you relate to life from there? Holy shit, I’m really, really sleepy, again, and I’m debating wether to go to the cold shower or to the bed to hug my girls. I’m falling asleep. But this are the kinds of moments where I have to push through, because part of being sleepy is being able to witness how some of the memories that are deep in there arise for me. Do I want to witness them? But I read before that they will show up as triggers that come from my interaction with people that have the capacity for being triggered. So is it that it will come through this writing or through the interaction with the world? What sense does that even make? Holy shit, I’m not being able to even think because of the sleepiness. I’m tired, and it is time for me to acknowledge that and ask myself: Is it that I need more sleep that the one I got? I’ll go and explore that now.

I ended up changing the place on which I was seated, to see if this new one brings about more wakefulness. This whole thing about resistance and knowing oneself is a big maze (haven’t you realized that yet?). I don’t even seem to know which is the place on which I know myself enough so that I can truly embody what it means to… What am I saying? What are the stories that I’m telling myself? I keep having this speech towards myself, that I’m not enough, that I’m not worthy of my own love, and I’m not allowed to be present, that there are aspects of myself that need to be changed. There are so many stories that I have been telling myself all this time, and I have been brutal with myself. I haven’t given me enough love, because of always being in this wheel of wanting to change something, of not accepting the integrity of what is there. But am I the only one? The problem is that I am the one that realizes it, but for example I have never heard my mother realize to herself that she is complaining about the reality of how things are, just here, right now. She is complaining most of the time, but she doesn’t suffer from it because it is just part of how she interfaces with reality. I am the one that suffers because it is something that I want to change in myself. I don’t want to be complaining about what is here, I just want to embrace everything, enjoy it, and move on with the understanding that each gift that I have been given in life is that, a gift. I bring suffering to my family because of this lack of acknowledgement, and it is time for me to get my shit together and move on from there, so that I can truly be present for my girls for when they need me. I have not done it correctly, but I have truly done my best. It is the best I have, right now, but the amazing part of it is that I’m receiving good and useful help for this process. I’m getting to know more and more of me, and of the people that I work with. And of the people that are around me. And those are the tools that will enable me to establish a nicer relationship with myself, and from there, to the world.

Yes, I may be sleepy, but there is something that wants to come anyway. It is the excitement and realization that life is truly beautiful. There are a lot of aspects of it that are magical, and this whole situation of how the unconscious manifests in the ways on which we relate to other human beings is just amazing. I’m very grateful for it.

What came to mind right now are the moments that we spent together in this house before my little baby was born. How were those moments? What was present in them? Did we get some dates or were we just stuck in the void of being in our own worlds? It seems like a big part of the past years have been like that, running on the back of our own tail, and realizing in that process that there is something that wants to be moved but we haven’t been able to. I think that it is mostly related to money. And also related with the role in society that you end up playing when you relate to money in some way. I mean, there are probably very few examples of this in the history of humanity because most of the people in the world have to work for establishing the means for having enough money to live, and in that sense, we are one of a million. I have not had to work for money for a long time, and here I am, running in circles behind the back of this book without a solid and healthy relationship with it. And I think to myself: Which is the role that money has played in my life? Why is my relationship with it the way it is? I guess that it is because it has been the major way on which my family has given me love. So, where does that leave me, and where does that leave me having in mind that there needs to be a moment on which I get my shit together and start building something that can help me buy bread at the end of the day?

One thing is relating to money, and another one is relating to the willingness to create an impact in the world. Right now I’m giving a lot of my energy for that, I’m building that impact every day, and it is in that that I can move more and more towards having that healthy relationship with money. I offer my time in the spirit of service, and I know that there will be a retribution from the universe in one way or another in the future. But I can’t feed my little daughter with the hope for that retribution to come, so it is a very tricky thing, to try to act in a selfless way in the world, giving my whole heart to it, but knowing that there needs to happen something that gives me the capacity for earning money. I’m not resolved in any way with that yet, and probably I will need to get some help in this regard, so that I can acknowledge the problem and work from there. I can’t live out of just thin air, and I realize that part of the problems that we have right now as a couple arise from the fact that neither of us has a job that brings money to the table. I mean, I asked a loan to write this book and it is my job, but do I truly see it as that? I have not been able to really, I’m not sure about that, because I’m always building up the space for not commiting fully to the ritual of sitting down to Do The Work. I speak about the importance of Doing The Work, but do I really do it? This makes me think about the craziness of the journey that I’ve gone through as I write this book, and how important it has been for me to give me the space to do it. I don’t have to be chasing money because life has given me this opportunity, and it is okay like that. It is not that I’m wasting it, it is not that I’m getting drunk or high or in drugs every day. I’m doing something very important here, and it is time for me to acknowledge it so that I can stop complaining about what is missing. See? Here I am, complaining about what is missing. I don’t have a proper job, so I don’t have money. What the fuck is that. In there future we will provide to each other everything that we need, so this state of being that I’m right here and right now embodying is the one of the future. How will people relate to themselves when that happen? I am an early adopter of that way of being. I am an early adopter of the future, I know that, and I trust in that. That is the mission that I have been given.

And it is my job to just write about how it feels. Just be sincere with all the shit that comes with it, so that you can read about it and know that you are not. The self doubt is real. The misery is real. The pain is real. It is just by walking towards it, through it, that it will become something different. And the whole journey that I have travelled with this book is an exploration into that. The most important piece of work of my life. It is very easy to put me down and say that it is not as important because no one is paying me for that, but what does that even mean? There is a famous painter that I think I have talked about that sold only one of his paintings in his whole lifetime, and then, after he died, ended up being one of the most famous ones. What he was doing was beyond himself, he was manifesting something that needed to be manifested through him, and that is the same that I’m doing here. It is just so easy to forget about that, and start complaining about what is not here. And that is what I started writing about at the beginning of the day, of me not being able to acknowledge what is in front of me. I have been putting my whole soul into this thing for almost 60 days and the only thing I do is complain because it is not good enough, or it is not something that pays me the bills, etc. I am one of the few human beings in the world that has the opportunity to live a life like this, to spend the amount of time that I spend with my little girl, and I complain about it? What the fuck is wrong with me?

Should it be different? There goes this mighty word. Always shouldding. Bringing in the expectation for something to be different. It is not supposed to be different, it is not supposed to be in any particular way. It just is, and the more and more that I realize that the more free I will become. Because it is just a matter of being able to witness what is in front of me and embracing it with everything that I have. Embracing it with my heart, with my whole being, and being truly, truly grateful for it. Grateful for all the gifts that I have been given. Grateful for the people that are part of my life, for the amazing human beings that are walking life next to me and that show me what I need to see in order to evolve. Grateful for each and every one of them. They are amazing. I am amazing. I am an antique piece, I am one of a kind, and this whole thing that I have been doing this whole time is an expression of that. It is me, just being myself. Just sharing with you my wounds, my pains, my troubles, and everything that I’m going through as I put my heart and all of who I am in the absolute willingness to wake up from the dream. 

Dukkha is the most powerful force that I have encountered, and this whole book is my way of battling through it. Each day is a new adventure, a new beginning, and each of these words will stay forever as the means by which I was able to face the biggest of my demons, one day and the next one, till I finally am free. From myself. From the ideas that I have inside of who I should be. From the ideas of what I’m not. From the ideas of who I should be. From the ideas of what every person that is around me should be. They are all stories, and I’m not all those stories. I’m not the mental construct that builds those stories as the means for interfacing with reality in a different way. Nope, I’m not those stories. I am beyond them. I am what is left when the stories are over. I am what is left when there is no one left to tell the story. I am the one that is witnessing the one that is telling himself the stories, and feels a bit of warmth inside because of the passion and commitment that this human being is putting inside for realizing that he is not the stories. You won’t ever know what I’ve gone through, and it is not my mission that you do. My mission is for you to be inspired, so that you can realize that all the craziness that is inside me and that is expressed through each and every one of the words that come up in this writing is just there, inside yourself, waiting to be explored and experienced. Be crazy, my friend, for it is there where the true life that we came to live comes from. Be crazy, my friend, and realize that all of what you came here to be you already are. Be crazy, my friend, and just explore life and every possibility that comes with it. Be crazy, my friend, and just live. Live as if there was no tomorrow, live as if this was the last day, live as if this was the last breath, because every notion that you can build inside your system related to first and last is just that, a construct that comes from the experience of living in time. And time is just that, a construct that is built from the willingness to live in time. From the willingness to perpetuate that illusion. Time is an illusion, and the more energy we give it the stronger it gets. It is time to get out of the illusion, and bring everything that you are into this moment. Right 
here, right now.

The only community that I have to build is the one of people that will gather around the work of my life. That is what this whole thing is about, and I’m travelling the path of understanding better and better which path that is. Why constrain myself to a DAO? To fit in something that is happening. But is that the truth that is inside myself? Is all that complexity similar to what I have inside? Does it resonate with what I have inside? What always shows up as valuable information is bitcoin, and how it being the crystalized life force can be the means by which information can flow in society. At the end of the day, there being infinite amount of different projects ends up being only noise, and I don’t want to have that noise going on. But I haven’t done the proper research that can help me realize which are the steps that I need to take. But the important thing is to take those steps, and right now I am in that path. Better understanding how to progress so that I can bring into life what is inside me. I did a breathwork session before and it brought a lot of clarity, and that clarity was expressed in calling my wife and asking her for us to go onto a journey tomorrow for two nights. I owe them a lot, this being trapped inside my own mind has been a nightmare for them, for sure, and I’m soooo looking forward to get out of there soon. 

Is it that in the future there won’t be any communities anymore and all the education will be done in the outer world? I think of that as the future of Twitter, as I go through the process of better understanding what is this thing that I want to bring into the world. What I’m doing. The community that I posed to build with Awaken The World is always running on the background of my thoughts, and it informs everything I do. Eventually, the community that I think of building on circle or discord or whatever place ends up being another place where people have to go on the internet, and that creates more noise. At least for me it is like that. What if every interaction that I had with every person through the internet was mediated by just one platform? How would that world look like? How would it feel to just go into one place and have everything in there? What you would need is a massive amount of willpower, to not waste time doing X when you ‘should’ be doing Y. But there goes the word, again, showing up. What is it that you ‘should’ be doing? At the end of the day, every interaction that you go through and everything that you do is information related to the place in life where you are at, and if you spend the whole day shitting in twitter and doomscrolling maybe that is what you need in that moment of your life. I don’t know. I don’t really know, but I think that I could make it by having all my interactions done in twitter if the interface was different. If there was place for this kinds of stuff. I imagine a cohort based course being done inside twitter, with live streaming, etc. It would be amazing, and from the perspective of the business it would also be great because people would be able to monetize and create cool content right there, inside the app. Anyway, that to say that I’m not sure if what I have to do is to help create that community out there. But as I write that I realize that that is how I think, but most of the world needs community, we need a place where to gather with others that are like minded, especially in this day and age. Why do I generalize? There is food for everyone on the table, it just depends about what is it that you want to do. How you prefer to interact. And that is the magic of how the world is evolving right now, because we are getting more and more ways of interacting, which will eventually collapse into one that will outrule them all. Who knows. I don’t really know. I’m just throwing thoughts into the wall here. Just exploring what comes. But the community that I want to build has always shown itself to me using bitcoin as the means of exchange and twitter as the means of communication. Making everything public. And working in there. The thing is to coordinate human beings and reduce more and more friction, until we get into a point of complete flexibility and flow. And I trust that what twitter is doing is moving towards that. I’m excited about that future. 

I’m thinking about something that a breathwork practitioner told me once, that what she did was mainly passed on by word of mouth. And that is cool for the work that I’m doing, because I will create a website to share my work in there. I don’t feel inspired to create an Instagram page on which I can share thoughts consistently, it is too much. I need to be intelligent about it, and if I depend on posting stuff in social media I will go mad eventually. I don’t want to be doing that for the rest of my life, so I need to create something that organically will give the results that are needed for the whole thing to work. I’m just projecting something into the future here, that may or may not work. Who knows. But the thing is that I’m here, sharing what I am with you, sharing the place where I have been, and sharing who I become by interacting with you. Because this is a way of interacting. With the ones that will come. With the ones that are already here and have not found this wisdom. 

Because yes, this is the wisdom that arises from that place of void. From the openness. That’s what I breathed before. Openness and clarity, the capacity to let go. Holy shit, how hard it is for me to let go. That knot that I have in the forehead sometimes feel like a stone, one that won’t let me alone. I’m stuck with it. And sessions of breathing like the one that I just had are very helpful for realizing what happens when I eventually let go of it. Of course there is that eternal voice in my head telling me that I won’t be able to get rid of it, is looks like a cartoon now, a funny cartoon that reminds me at all times that I won’t be free, but there are moments on which I forget it and become a bit lighter. So yes, the breathwork session was very helpful for connecting with that, and I did my best in it. It brings to me the motivation of wanting to learn more about the practice so that I can have more tools for guiding people. It is important to do that, to have the means in myself for dealing with hard stuff. Because it may get hard. A lot can come out, and by reading and learning more I will become more and more used to deal with those things that come up. And that is eventually where this whole journey is bringing me to, to host that podcast every day on which we’ll go through a breath together with a random person listening to the album that she or he would take to the other side. I love the concept, and it feels like I’m opening a door right now but it is very hard to open it because I don’t truly know how to do it because I have never done it and I don’t know how to even share what I have done or the work that I’ve done but I can realize more and more that the way on which I’m able to share what I’ve done is just by being more and more of myself. Sharing myself, sharing what I bring into the world, so that I can embody it with more and more clarity. That is what is needed: clarity. That is what it takes. That is what is brought also with the practices that I’m doing, because the work is not complete if you go through a transformational session and then you don’t change anything in your life. There needs to be a shift that ends up being the way on which you relate to everything that happens to you. Are you reacting or taking action? What is the relationship that you have with what shows up in your life? How does breathwork help you to move towards a relationship that is more aligned with yourself?

These are all ways on which I think more and more about what I’m doing, and why I’m doing it. What is that I want to bring into the world? I have been running through so many different places with my writing here, going from a web3 company to not web3 to podcast to twitter spaces, etc. It is all a maze, one that is not clear at all in my head yet. And the only way on which it will become clear is by sharing myself to the world. Opening up to realize what is present in me, and what do the interaction with other human beings bring. And yes, what is present is tiredness. Sleepiness. I’m sleepy. I can feel it, realize it, and it is part of the game that I’m playing right now. It seems that it is mate time, so that I can be there for the person that I’m going to walk through a breath right now. 

It's funny that I write that as if I was giving an excuse to myself. I’m telling myself that it is ok to drink mate. It is ok to be sleepy. It is ok to be myself. I’m telling myself that it is ok to be myself.

Yesterday I gave myself the permission to listen to a podcast that appeared to be part of the mainstream culture in my country, and I realized how far away I am from living my life like that. To have those kinds of conversations. To relate to each other like that. But there is an aspect of separation in what I speak about, and having listened to it is an interesting avenue to explore that separation. Where does it come from? What is it about? I don’t really know, so I’m just here, witnessing what comes. In some moments lost, in others found. In some moments with clarity, in others with that fog on the top of my mind. But what I know for sure is that I can help other people, and that I’m doing, so yes, it is time for me to go there. Tomorrow will be another day.
