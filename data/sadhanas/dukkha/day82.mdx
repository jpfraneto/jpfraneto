82 days writing every day so that I can walk towards a deeper state of clarity and here I am, deeper into the maze of not knowing what step to take next than ever. I’m lost, I have infinite opportunities of stuff to do, and it is so easy to get lost in them. I have a strong willingness to start my own business, and a need also. I mean, I need to generate income, and getting a job is not something that is within my plans. So that means that I have to start a business, but the thing is: Which is the scope of that business? Does it make sense to go big and aim for a startup or it makes more sense to stay chill and be in direct relationship with the people that I will help? Eventually it all boils up to the scope on which I want to act. But the thing about starting a bigger company is the fun that comes with it. I’m not very identified with everything that comes from earning money and that kind of stuff, but after my experience being part of a masters program in innovation in university I got the feeling that a big part of the people that are starting companies and that are venture capitalists are people that think in a similar way than me. But the question that I ask myself a lot is: Do I have what it takes? Can my relationship with money be used in favor of doing something like this? I don’t know really, I’m in this place where I don’t know absolutely anything.

I just know that I’m clever. Because I don’t know anything but I put myself in the position of needing to make decisions soon. I applied to this program called nights and weekends and I got in, and in there we will build. We will create something, whatever it is, and it is my mission to be in time to that. It is my mission to do it. I will have 6 weeks and in every week there will be updates to the thing, progress will be made, and with that, something will happen. I still don’t have any clue of what I’m going to work on, I have so many ideas and it is very hard for me to decide on which one I will build, but I will do it. It is just part of what comes now. But I truly don’t know where to start. I have written all what I have written here in order to reach some place that makes me feel comfortable related to what I’m going to do next, but I don’t have any clue.

So what makes sense now is just to share with you what is going on inside me, and how my meditation practice is evolving. Eventually, everything else that I will do is just a consequences of the state of evolution that I’m at, and right now I feel that I’m evolving crazy. Even as I write this there are slight tears coming out of my eyes, and a sensation of openness in the third eye area that brings a very special flow of energy towards the back of my ears, on top of them. This kind of flow of energy has been constant in my meditation the last days, and I feel that I’m making a lot of progress in it. It’s becoming very interesting. That’s the thing, when I think about something that I will build I always come from this victim mentality that it is not good enough. It is very important for me to be able to shift this perspective and be able to realize that what I will create will add a lot of value to the world, and that value will transform it, in one way or another. Through what I will create, I will help other people evolve, and I need to embody that so that I can trust in what is going to happen. Until now, I have not been able to do it because I never trust in myself or my ideas or what I have to offer enough, but I’m done with that. It doesn’t help me anymore. It is not something that I want in my life now. I just want to enjoy my life, and I just want to embody the gifts that I bring so that I can show the best version of myself to the outside. And how does that version look? Open. Kind. Loving. Willing to explore. Fun. I’m all that, and much more. It is just that I don’t allow myself to experiment with it, and to share with the world all of what I am.

What are the things that I know for sure about what I want to build? Do I even have an answer for that? I know that web3 captivates my attention, the whole spirit behind it is something that I want to bring more to the world. I love it. I know that I want to have the coolest office in my town, in the downtown of it, with a bench outside on which I can sit and talk to whoever is passing by. I know that I want it to be the coolest place in my town, and I’m going to work till I get to that point. I know that there is a intellectual challenge that I need to experiment so that I can feel good with myself, and that is built around the notion of deep work sessions. I know that I want to work deep, so that the results can flow out from there. Do I know if I want to continue helping people in their road with breathwork? There is value in me on doing that, for sure, but is it something that I see myself doing every day? I’m not sure, at least not yet. I know that each session is important and it brings a lot, both for me and for the person that I work with, but do I want to do it like that? There is a part of me that wants to reach out to more people, work with more of them, etc. But do I really want that? And a big important thing related to this is: Are we going to have another baby? Because if that is the case, it will be important for me to be in the house, so that I can help and spend time with my kids. If I begin my journey as a startup entrepreneur now, I won’t have time to spend in the house, and everything will be much different. I think that that is a conversation that we need to have with my partner, so that we can place ourselves in the same page and resonate from there. I think it is important to have a conversation with all this thing with her, so that I can truly understand where we are going as a family and how what I’m going to build will fit in this whole thing.

What if I posed the challenge of building the most incredible transformational journey through the internet? I already have the help of dan and the people from awaken the world. And the network that they have created is very important, and what can happen there is huge. What if I’m able to bring in all those cool people that want to enhance the way on which we experience life, and a safe container for that can be created? One that is built on top of the notions of web3, and one that has as a clear mission the realization of the true nature of the people that participate. One thing is to create an online course, another thing is to create a container for people to discover the truth. I feel like an evangelist talking about a certain truth, but that is what is in me right now. Maybe I should just stop talking about that so much and focus on doing my thing, merging breathwork with creativity so that I can help people do their thing. What if I gave them the opportunity to start their own business, using all the knowledge that they have gathered in their life so that they can come up with something new and have the passion and consistency and perseverance and creativity to build something that did not exist before?

That is one of the key things that I have been dealing with this whole time, how my work merges with the creative aspect of human beings, and how that creativity is unleashed by working with the breath and with intention of becoming something new, something different. But there is always this noise related to the startup, you know. It feels like a game, a game on which you get to play with really, really cool people, and with that, impact in society in a particular way. I know that I have what it takes. I know that I have good ideas. I know that I can make good decisions. I know that this can be something very interesting, and it is running around in the back of my mind all this time. That’s the thing, because the breathwork adventure, I can do it another time. It is just part of what I can do afterwards. But the startup thing is something special, new, that can bring a lot of joy in my life. I’m already thinking about who I will sell the company to. Love. I will work towards building a marketplace on which coaches, therapists, etc can offer their work. And it will be cool to place an AI inside there, so that it can recognize what kind of help does that person need and with that make the match between the person and the one who will help her. This is an idea that has been going through my mind a lot, and it makes sense for me to go all in with it right now, in this program, because it is the opportunity that I have for it, you know? I will never have an opportunity like this to be as deep inside the whole system, and it is one that I need to take care of. I need to use it intelligently. A big part of the successes of today’s business are people that have built bridges between things that already exist, and given them a new way of using them. Think about Uber, that gave a new usage to the cars that people already had. Think about Airbnb, that gave a new usage to the spare room that people had in their houses. Think about Rappi, which gave a new usage to the vehicles that people had so that they could bring something from A to B. Think about Cornershop, which gave a new usage to the time of people and gave them a completely new revenue source. The place where we heal. How is that different from insight timer for example? It is different, because everything is related to the way on which we frame things. If you are able to sell a story, that is what ends up reaching the other person. And it feels very interesting to get into this whole thing, of creating a story, of being able to manifest it into a reality. But on the other side I feel that I’m going into a rabbit hole that I shouldn’t be going in.

Why is there this necessity for complexity in my experience? I truly wonder that. Why is it that there is such a big tendency for complexity inside me? And there is a lack of understanding of the steps that need to be taken so that something can happen as I’m thinking it can happen. Right now, I’m thinking about all these things, not even realizing which are the steps that I need to take to get there. I’m completely lost, in the middle of the desert, trying to make my way through everything that is around me with a compass that is full of dust. And I try to list that dust, surely I do. I do all the things that are in the roadmap for how to take the dust out of the compass, all the techniques and practices, but it doesn’t seem to work. It just gets thicker. I just go deeper into the maze. I’m deep into this maze, you know? Can’t you see it? Can’t you experience it through my words, through everything that I express to you in this writing? Isn’t it too much? This is how much someone can be trapped in their own experience. And now I’m becoming dizzy, and words are becoming blurry. The coffee. I’m testing how coffee feels in my system, and it was not a great one. It was just the one that I found in here, and it was not good. But anyway, it helps, to bring new sensations, emotions, ideas and experiences into my being. And that is what I’m doing here, exploring all of those so that I can move on with it.

So yes, here I am, trying to move on with it but not really knowing how to do it. What if there was a marketplace where all the people that work in alternative healing could share what they do and find others? I imagine all those yoga teachers, those breathwork practitioners, those witches and alchemists, which could converge in a place like this and from there help others. Bring them together so that they can gather strength, so that they can be there for others. But is that the life that I want to live? Is that the situation that I want to put myself in? Every entrepreneur that I hear of is very excited about what they do, but they are also exhausted and it is a lot of work. Emotional work. Personal work. But I have done it, you know? I feel ready, I feel prepared, and this opportunity feels like an entrance point into a new way of being. What if I already had in mind what I applied with to the Crypto Startup School and decided to move on from there? What if I work with the people that want to get into the tech industry and pose them the challenge of building a project from scratch without any help and let them explore how that solution would look like? What if that was the next stage after everything that I did last year, on which I worked all what I worked in The Open Source Factory? What if that is like a suiss knife that has many tools inside and all those tools are built by the community? And we all vote for the best one of each batch, and with that, ship what they shipped into production. And from there we can start evolving, making changes. It is like a bootcamp merged with something different, more open. For the ones that will build the future. I have a strong feeling, that people need to be able to create their own stuff, and find the resources to do it themselves. That is the world on which we live, and the question that comes is: What will TOSF offer them for doing this? What will we bring into their life?

What buildspace is doing is very similar, it is just more and more open. It is just more people building at the same time, but with no boundaries. We can all create whatever we want, however we want. There are no permissions to be granted. There is only an exploration that will take place with each day that comes by, and in that exploration whatever is built we be built. It is the magic of building. Of coming up with something new, novel, which can bring more of my particular truth to the world. May that look like how it looks like. It doesn’t truly matter. What just matters is that I put my heart and everything that I have behind it. And in that sense, I have already given a lot of energy to the path that I have walked with Dan and the awaken the world community. I have given a lot to that. And it is already happening. There is already things going on in that world. We are already having conversations about the community that we will create. And I feel that if I go to another place, or start building something different, my energy will be split. Do I want my energy to be split or do I want full focus? Which is the frame that I want to place in this thing? The one of fun. Of joy. And this is a golden opportunity that I have at hands, working with a person like Dan, that knows so much, that has seen so much, that has experiences so much. Why would I go so far away from this if I can just explore what it brings with him? How would it look like to just surrender all this willingness of thing to be extremely complex and I just surrendered to what is already happening, right in front of my nose. I’m already working with 4 people with the breath. I’m already having the conversations with Dan. Why so much complexity? It is time to give up that complexity, and just flow with what is. Right here, right now. Not with the ideas that are around my head in the ether of everything that I could do if I just focused in it. Not the ideas of everything that is possible. Just the truth of what is, here and now, and it is time to embody that in a way that can transform lifes. Because this thing truly can transform lifes, one after the other one, like a cascade. There is nothing that I can do that has this kind of potential.

Not creating an online course, not creating an online experience, not creating a cohort. Creating a transformational journey, one that will be designed to transform the relationship that the person has with her experience of reality. This will be deep. Strong. Powerful. And I’m here, running around with so many stuff going on inside me not realizing that the truth is right in front of my eyes. I just need to take the next step, and that next step is just witnessing what is. What has always been. What will always be.

I’m kind of dizzy with all these options, with all these opportunities, with all this ideas. Yesterday I came to write and there was an absolute clarity in me related to the way on which I was going to explore what comes. I was clear that I wanted to build these offices that would transform everything. And now I come up with this. It changed once again. Why do I run from one thing to the other? What is it about me that needs this?

Who are the people that will be part of these transformational journeys? I’m thinking about people that are ready to step into a new way of being, and for that, what is important is that they have the time and energy to commit to that. They are transitioning into starting their own business. That’s what feels good. They are owning the way on which they earn money, so that they can become free. They can’t be completely free if they are working for someone else, so this project makes sense to be aimed for those kind of people. So that they can witness the truth of their beingness, and from there, establish a deep relationship with what can come at the other side. I have been writing about this the whole time, and it is time for me to explore and experience and bring about more of what I want to build so that I can be clear about it. I’m clear about the signals that life is giving me. I have these 4 people that I’m working with that are amazing. I’m learning a lot about my capacity of showing them their truth. I’m helping them to witness their truth in an absolutely new way. We are working towards that. I’m exploring everything that it takes. Being there. Being there. For them. For myself. At the end, that is all what matters. I can put all my energy in a startup that will end up being noise in the world, or I can put all my energy into working with people that are already changing the world with the work that they are doing. I can build a new means by which we can wake up and evolve towards the truth of who we are. There I am again, talking truth, but it is what is in me. I mean, the truth has always been there, it is just that it has been blinded by my experience. And it hurts. It is exhausting. I’m tired of the suffering. And do I think that if I start this big company the suffering will cease to be? I don’t think so. And that’s the thing, I’m taking this as if it was the last opportunity in my life to create something like this, but it is not, you know? I’m just starting. I can get in N&W 3 and apply with a new idea, one that will bring about this need that I have for going deeper in my journey of exploration of what is possible if I create a startup. Is this truly the last opportunity in the world that I have for creating something like this? Nope, it isn’t. And if I am really intelligent with what I’m doing, I should have in mind the power of what I can create if I work with the people that I’m already in contact with. These are the people that will help me come up with the ideas and tools and everything that is needed for us to embody what is needed to bring into the world. Part of the complexity that I bring into my life is not accepting what I have in front of me as opportunities, and spend all this time searching for something that is not here. Something else. Something different. Seeking, seeking and seeking for something different, not realizing that the wealth of what is with me now is everything that I need. Eventually, I want to create this company and big thing because there is a need in me for something else, something new, something huge, and I’m spending a long time thinking about it. And putting all my energy into it. What if I opened up to the possibility that I only work in the N&W project 88 minutes every day? What if it is not the whole 4 hours of work but just 88 minutes? How would that look like? How would it feel? I don’t know, I just explore it so that I can better understand what it brings into my being. And I feel like a robot writing all these words, without truly feeling what they bring. Without embodying what they bring. What I experienced in the samadhi center is real, is the most real thing that I have experienced, and I want more of that in the world. I want to do the hard work. I want to experience it fully. And I think that people are done with the suffering also, and that what comes is the moment on which we wake up. It is time to wake up, I have been saying that all these days, but now is time to embody it with my actions. With my whole being. I’m sure that the people that are depressed are the ones that are closer to waking up, because their ego is so solidified that it may be easier to bring it apart. To see it as it is. To have that moment of truth, that will make all the difference. Because once you experience that the whole perspective that you have related to what you do and how you relate to life is transformed, evolved. Renewed. And that means everything. It is everything. And I’m here to explore that. To witness that. To embody it, and live from it. I’m here to bring truth to the world, and the breath is the means by which I’m able to do it fully. I’m here to manifest my dreams, without even knowing which they are. What is my dream in life? The biggest one of them all? To be free. To be truly able to experience every moment as if it was the last one. To be in service. To be every day a bit more of who I have always been, but sometimes forget because of all the noise.

At the end of the day, what I just want is to create art. Beauty. To manifest my truth into the world by becoming an artist that is able to translate his own and particular truth into whatever comes. That is the exploration that I’m doing, and I’m working with how to do it. I was going to write the word properly but then I realized that there is no proper way to do it, there just is a way and that way is to just sit down and do the work. Make it happen. That’s what it takes, you know? And that is the mission that I’m at right now, and that I will be for the next 6 weeks. To embody what I want to bring into the world and make it happen. And use this container that I have, working with than and the team of atw, to do it. They have connections with the coolest people in the planet in the world of spirituality. They are the ones that are doing cool stuff, with every connection that is going on. They are bringing this into life, and it is up to me to embody that so that I can bring more and more of it into the world. I’m already working with them, and it is time for me to witness what can happen if I’m able to surrender my will into what the world is showing me as the next steps. Why would I want to reach out to all the world if it would end up just being noise? Why don’t I use this following 6 weeks to build the most amazing community on the internet related to the end of suffering? To the awakening of humanity. It is time to wake up, and that will only happen if we are able to witness the truth of our being. Which is the process by which that will happen? I don’t think that having an open community will play the trick, because the real thing is what you do in the world, and an open community always end ups getting lost in the thing. There needs to be a container with a specific way of doing things, with a specific goal. There needs to be a clear program, one which will bring people into their truth. I always remember the altMBA, which was a very intense program that people put a lot of energy and effort in, and that ended up having the impact that it has because of that. People paid 3000+ usd dollars to be part of that thing, and invested a lot of time and energy in it. And it is was all about personal and emotional growth. Now it is time to create something new, novel, more powerful, that will bring about the power that is needed from each of us to create the new world. It is time to Do The Work, and this program is going to be for that. It is going to be the awakening of humanity made public for the world to witness, to experience, to embody. It is not something that you will be able to come in and just work in it partially, it will be something that people will need to put their soul in it. Embody everything that happens in here completely. Fully. I know that it feels like a lot to ask people for this kind of commitment, but that is the price that you have to pay for transformation. That is the early adopters price.

And the thing is that we won’t have available the tools of exploration of consciousness that would be available if we were to connect physically in a retreat, so everything needs to be built in a different way. In the retreat we worked with iboga because it was the plant that catalyzed a deeper process of meditation, but here we won’t have that, at least not clearly. But it may be a possibility to microdose, you know? If we look ahead in time, there will be a moment on which microdosing will be possible, and in that time we may be able to ship it to people. It is the same that for the altMBA, program in which I was sent beforehand this box with all the tools that were needed for it to be as powerful as it was. There is a huge role that this can play in the development of a program like this, and it is time for me to realize that the power of what I can build is just in front of my eyes. It is time to open the eyes and witness the truth that is in front. It is time to embody that truth, and live with it. Experience it completely. It is the moment for that. It is time for it. And eventually there can be a place in different cities that can act as the church was before. A place where people can go and feel in peace. Just sit. Without preconceptions, without limitations. Just be there. That is how I can merge everything that I have been imagining in my mind with the store downtown. That store is the place where people go to create. The creators avenue. The creators world. The world of creation. Where deep work happens. And then deep relaxation. A massage to the brain, and to every part of it. That’s the thing, I’m thinking about automatizing everything even before it exists. Why would I do that. It doesn’t make sense. Why would I bring into my life the challenge of being at the forefront of humanity in the technological realm if I can be at the forefront in the spiritual one. This is spiritual warfare. The shit is getting real, and the most valuable people of them all will be working on this. The ones that have walked the path. The ones that know it. The ones that want the best for all of us. That is the truth that life has been showing to me, and I have not taken the call yet. But that email that I received yesterday is an invitation to be with what is. To experience what is. To explore what already is. And what is? My experience. Everything that I have inside. I was part of the altMBA. I was part of the retreat in the samadhi center. I have been to all the vipassanas that I have been. I have seen what I have seen. I have experienced what I have experienced. It is all inside me, within me, and it is time for me to embody everything that those experiences have brought and be able to create something magical. Important. Transformative. Transformational journeys, that is the theme that I have been having within me this whole time. It is time to bring it into life, and surrender to what life can answer back to it. It is the deepest work that I can do, to be in service of humanity. To be able to explore what it takes. What it brings. To create. To evolve. To open up that door of evolution, and realizing that it is beautiful. That it is magical.

How does life look like when it becomes the intersection of a meditation retreat and a music festival? What is present in the day to day actions when that is the truth? Meditation, deep work, deep relaxation. Nourishment of the soul and the senses. Care about your surroundings. We are not built or meant or created to spend as much time as we do right now in these kinds of activities like working all day long. That will soon be part of the past. It is time to evolve that, and realize that a new way of being is possible. That it is coming. And how it will come? With the help of those who have come before. With the help of the beauty that comes from the exploration within. The deepest journey is not the one that will take us to mars, it is the one that will take us within. Step up, get ready and enjoy the ride. It is time for us to shine.
