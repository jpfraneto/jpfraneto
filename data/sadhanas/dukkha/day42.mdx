So I came here to write for a new day and I encountered that yesterday I did not write because it was Saturday so I opened a new document and wrote ‘Resting is an integral part of doing the work’. There is a part of me that thinks (yes, it is the part that thinks… the rational one) that it is good to not come and do my thing on Saturdays, but then I witness what happens from there and I miss it. Yes, resting is important, but the thing is that it is also important to just come and explore whatever comes up in a day like that. As I wrote a few days ago, when I don’t come and write, I lose the possibility of going a little bit deeper into the exploration of myself because I lose the anchoring of who I am in that particular moment in the future. I can’t come back to any writing to see who I was yesterday, the 5th of November of 2022. I smoked a lot of weed, and had very good ideas about how to make progress with what I’m building. What is it that I’m building? I don’t know yet, but I do know that I’m giving myself this time to write about it, so that I can better understand what it is. This writing is the means by which I process everything that has come through my being, so that I can transform it into a reality that can be the means by which I am in the world. And it is even funny to witness myself writing about that, because the way on which I will be in the world is the way on which I’m being right now. I’m doing my breathwork thing, helping people from there, and it is important for me to realize that that is more important than anything that I can conceive that I will do in the future. I will offer my full presence to a particular human being once every day, and that is everything that I need so that I can be an active part of the building of the new world. The rest will happen by itself. It is even not that important to think about what is what I’m going to build. Let it just happen. Make myself survive until then, but I will make it. And it will be very fun. I’m already on that way, on my path towards the helping of others, and I opened the door by helping my friends.

Yes, it is with them that I will start, offering my full presence for their path of getting better with who they are right now. I will work with 10 people every 6 months, and I already have 3 of those 10. And more will come. And that is the great thing about opening up those avenues, that people will come. I have spent a lot time opening up to the internet to see who are the people that want to connect with the ideas that I’m spreading, and I have not been able to realize, or witness, or explore, or acknowledge, the care that the people that already know me have shared with me. Most of the people that know who I am, that know me personally, trust me. That is a fact. I’m a person that just because of his way of being builds trust in the world, in the people with which I interact, and it is very important that I acknowledge that so that I can move towards an understanding of which is the value that I bring into the world.

Perhaps that is the answer to the prompt: Tell me who you are. I am the one that they trust. It is just that it is soooo hard for me to acknowledge that for myself. To see myself in the footsteps of that person that is trusted. I don’t even trust myself, I don’t trust my decisions, because they should be different. I should be different. I should behave in a different way. But the nice thing about those shoulds is that: I am the one that is judging. They are generally not. They are on their own beings, exploring what they should do, and blaming themselves for not meeting the expectations of who they should be. They are not even thinking about myself as much as I think I am.

When you picture in your mind that someone is thinking about you, judging you, blaming you, it is more probable that you are doing that for yourself than they actually doing it. You are not the center of the universe, you only think that you are the center of yours (which is a reality only until you wake up to the truth of your being).

What a hard thing to put the mind around. It just feels so natural to think that everyone is thinking about me all the time, which is especially expressed as something is shared in social media. There is this tendency to think that everyone is just judging what was posted, as if it was the only thing that they saw that day. As if it was the most important thing in the world. What a nonsense. How would it feel to be free from the burden of wanting to please everyone? To realize that there are people that won’t like you, and be ok with that? I guess that that is what being polarizing is about, and that is why those kind of people are so successful in this kind of platforms. They are the ones that made it. They are the ones that don’t care. They are the ones that are willing to give a shit, because it is true. It doesn’t really matter. The only thing that matters is that you share the truth of who you are, and if that truth is that you think something particular about a situation, so be it. Just be ok with it. That’s what it means to embody truth, to be in resonance with the truth that is within you.

I don’t even know why I ended up writing about that, but it felt like what was needing to come out. Today I went to my parents house and spent the afternoon there, witnessing all the different ways on which I’m triggered while being in their presence. I realize that I was forcing my mother into a particular behavior, by pushing her to do something that I saw would be very helpful in a problem that she has. The thing is that what she truly needed from me in that moment was not for me to give her advice. In the depth of who she is, she knows what she has to do. But there is a barrier between that and the action that is built on top of years and years of emotional stuff that has not been resolved, so what she really needed from me was not to blame her for not doing something. What she needed was for me to be there for her, and just listen to how she felt. It is so hard for me to do that. To open up that space. It is the space that I will go in when I hold the space facilitating breatwork. The one of just wanting to be there for the transformation of others. I don’t need to be the one that transforms them. I can only be my tool for transformation. My own one. There is no space in myself for helping others to become more of what they can be, it is just that they have to realize that for themselves. I just need to be there for that transformation, if it wants to take place. My role is to be the catalyzer for that to happen, but not force it. Force is not the means to do things in a sustainable way. Patience is the way. That is the path forward.

I’m very stuck with the music that I’m listening to, and it feels that it is the avenue that my being wants to explore for going deeper in the exploration of what is present. I could spend all the time blaming my parents for not being what I expect them to be, or them not behaving in a particular way, but for what? It doesn’t really matter. What matters is the music. That is the way by which brains are opened by the half. Music is the gatherer of people, it is the glue that brings people together, no matter who they are. One of the most important albums of my life is of Chayanne, who sings ballads in stadiums with 80 thousand women signing like crazy all of his songs. What could possibly be more like glue than this? I spend all this time going through this writing to uncover the depths of who I am and what is showing itself is that that depth is very much connected with music. Everything that I do revolves around that, and it just makes so much sense to have it connected to the work of my life. I keep bringing that into my work, and it is the way on which I want to build my future. If I could design my perfect day, how would it be? And for sure it would be listening to a new album every day, with my whole consciousness focused only on the individual that recommended it. That feels like the best way to spend my energy, and get to a point on which I’m respected enough as a breathwork practitioner that I can go into that journey with that person with breathwork. Use the breath as the means for going deeper into the joy of what that particular album is in the life of the person. The prompt is always: If you died tomorrow, what album would you take to the other side? What happens if I connect that with the fact that you can learn how to die before you die? What if that meeting that I will have with them will actually be the moment on which they die before they die? What if I approach each of those interactions as the means by which they die? They cease to exist as the person that they have been until now, and they become everything of who they are on the depth. They dissolve into the music of their choice. That is the game that we are going to play. That is where this whole thing is going. I’m building my reputation by the interactions that I go in through the internet, in every one of my forms, in every one of the platforms on which I’m active, so that people can begin to realize that I’m worth of their trust.

That’s the game that I’m playing here. The one of adding value to each person with which I connect. Just by telling them that I’m here. The rest will just happen. That’s what working with social media mindfully is about. It is going in there with intention, with the true intention of wanting to connect with others. To live life through their eyes. If they don’t care about that, if they don’t mind, it is not my problem. I can just filter and move to the next person. There is plenty of them out there. I’m one of the weird ones, and it feels amazing.

The world is such an interesting place, full of people that are discovering who they are, unveiling everything, and building on top of the wealth that our parents have generated so that we can just explore. Just be part of the transition into the new world by giving up what it means to have a house for example because it is too expensive and instead live life in a different way, with another set of expectations, and realizing that it will be ok. The only reason because of which you have to save for retirement is because you think that you will need that when you retire. How will the world look like when I retire? I don’t think that at that point we will be talking about money anymore. Maybe we will be talking about life force, and about how it flows in society as energy. Maybe it will be more related to attention. Which is the attention that I’m giving to other people, and how does that attention relate to the impact that they have in my life? That is a question that brings a lot of curiosity into my being, and it feels amazing to think about the world of the future, on which everything will be absolutely different from what is going on right now. Ok. That’s it with my writing for today. I did not bring too much new to the table, but it is what I am right now. It was an important day. A nice one.
