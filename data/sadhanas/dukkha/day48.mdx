Speaking about the extinction of humanity is often done from the place of our physical existence. It means that we all die. I wonder: What would happen if we challenged this assumption? In the moment that our true nature -awareness- is realized, we will move towards an understanding that there is truly nothing to be extinct. Awareness can’t die, it is not alive. That is what is going through myself right now, as I delve into what remains when we die. Yesterday was a nice afternoon, we went to my grandmother’s house and listened to the stories of the family, of those who had died. My great grandfather, who one day was doing chores downtown of the city where I live right now and the next day died of a heart attack in the same room where we were talking yesterday. What part of him does still remain? What is present when he is gone? In which ways his impact determines the way on which I relate to life, because of the impact that he had in my grandmother, and she in my mother?

It is amazing to think about life in these terms, the string of consequences that carry on through life because of the way on which the people that we are familiarly related impact the way we have of existing. We are connected to them in ways that are hard to imagine, and I wonder right now: what does remain when those aspects of myself are fully integrated and each of those patterns of actions are set free from the ‘doing what has been done’ thing? If every aspect of my unconscious is made conscious, I become free of all the ways of doing things that are unconsciously carried on by just the fact of being part of my family, and that means that life can fully be expressed through me, without the limitations of the friction that is produced by having to be in a particular way because of the expectations that I have about myself and the expectations that those in my environment have about myself also. What happens when I’m free of all these expectations? What does remain? How do I relate to that?

I had a long time on which I did a Friday ritual, which consisted on downloading a film and watching it with as much consciousness as I could. But a big part of it was going outside as the sun was setting, and just expressing gratitude to the trees. To the place where I live. To all the ones that worked their ass of so that we could be established in this part of the world. That gratitude was real, is real, and sometimes I forget it in the frenzy of wanting to be in a different place. Of changing something. Of being someone different, somewhere different. Two weeks ago we went to visit some friends to a city called Pucon and I interpreted the feelings that I had being there as my heart telling me that that was the place where I wanted to live. That’s the place where I want my girl to grow, I told to myself and to the people that was there with us. But now, being here, having the opportunity of going to my grandmothers house and listening to her stories, I realize more than ever that the important work is what needs to happen here. I need to fully accept where I come from, and embody every aspect of what it means to be part of this family. Of what it means to be the consequence of everything that happened, every day, in this same place where I am living right now. If I look outside, in my backyard there are 10 huge ashes, which are the trees that my great grandmother planted. They have the information of her, the caring of her, and that means a lot to me. The more I write about it, the more I listen to the stories of my grandmother, the more I feel connected to what it means to live in this place. The more grateful I am by the life that I have been given.

These days have been unclear related to the relationship that I have with my wife, we’ve had some discussions because she always feels that I’m trying to change her. I remember being travelling the world and deciding to come back so that I could start my life establishing roots here, in this place. I remember calling her one day asking her what was what I had to do so that she could come back and we could start a family. I remember every moment that we have struggled, and what it means to do a lot of effort to create a family that is worth the pain. I don’t need to remember, because I feel right now what it means to have them on the room next to where I am at, both of them sleeping like angels, waiting for a new day to begin soon enough. Life is perfect as it is right now, and the fact that I think that there is something that should change is just a construct of my mind.

Yesterday I was part of a talk of a company that is building the means for people to create digital products, on web3 and with ML/AI, and they said that IRL was a very important part of what they did. A part of me feels left behind because of that, because I also want to be where the cool kids are. I want to have conversations with them. But there is nothing that I could truly change from the place where I live, because I know that the answer is here. I know that needing to be in SF, or Dubai, or Bangalore, or Barcelona, is just running behind the carrot again. Is just escaping from just being.

What I always think about is fairness. Would life be so unfair to give the opportunities of happiness just to those who have the capacity (because of their wealth, their passport, the color of their skin, etc) to travel abroad and go to live to another place where ‘more stuff is happening’? Would it be like that? I don’t think so. I truly don’t think so. What I think is that life is fair, and it gives us the opportunity to all of us be happy and free. And it is just that we are not able to see it clearly. We always think that there is something more that should be present so that we could be happy. Maybe it is a good time to start peaking from my standpoint. I play that game too. I end up being a victim of that game, of the wanting everything to be different. Of the willingness to explore life in a different way. Of having more of something. Of being more connected. Etc. That showed up in my morning meditation, on which in one moment I realized that I was actively trying with all my energy to make it different from what it was in that moment. And that is not what the game is about. That is not what the practice is about. The practice is developing perfect equanimity with what is. Right there, right in that moment. Not wanting stuff to be different. Not wanting to change. Accepting what is, so that you can go deeper into the understanding of what truly is. What is not changing. Is seems that everything is always changing, that is the only constant in the world. In the material realm. But what does not change? What is always present there?

That is the question that needs to be asked in the meditation process, not the one of where should I move towards so that I can go deeper with it. So that I can have a particular experience. So that I can wake up. Those are all noises of the mind, wanting something new, novel to happen, and being disappointed because the effort has not been enough. But it is never enough. The effort is never enough. It is just time to wake up to that truth, to the truth that it will never be enough. And give up that quest for things to be more than what they are, right here, right now. Being free means giving up the willingness for things to be different from what they are. From what happens in my practice of meditation to what happens in my daily life to what happens with my writing to what happens with my wife to what happens with my family to what happens to my parents to what happens to my brother to what happens with my interactions with the world to what happens with my city to what happens to the world. Become free of it. Become free from the caring about the consequences of my actions. What I need to care about is just the action itself, not the consequences of it. I just need to show up and care about what I do, and the rest will happen from there. I have an understanding of what I care about, what I want to bring into the world, and everything that I’m doing here with this writing is getting rid of all what is not. Of all the stuff that I want to leave behind. Of all the stuff that I want to become free from. That’s true freedom, realizing that there is nothing that should be changed, because it is already changing. And it is perfect as it is, right here, right now. Life is perfect as it is right here, right now, and it is important for me to embody that message so that I can offer it to the ones that are closer to me. Start from there. Give me space for starting from there. And craft the future on which I want to live, by embodying the present moment. Every future is a consequence of what happens right here, right now, and if I’m tuned with what is going on in my immediate experience I will be able to craft a nicer future. Or just craft it. The nicer or uglier is just a label, and labels are what define stuff into what they are or aren’t, and at the end of the day all of those labels are just a construct of the mind. They are not real, per se. What is real is what happens behind the label, in spite of it. And that is where we are heading to, to a future where labels are just a thing of the past. When we communicate with each other through language we use labels so that we can express to one another something, but those labels are always an interpretation that the individual does of what is being conveyed.

I talk to you about a feeling, but what you listen brings into yourself is different from what I have inside. You are interpreting through your own biases what I’m talking about, and because of that, the communication is never absolutely clear. There is always something lost in translation. What would happen if we were able to convey everything that we could in the way on which we communicated with each other? How would that communication look like? How would it make us feel? And right now I think that the biggest stone in the road for this communication to happen are our own biases. If you talk to me, I filter what you are saying through my biases. What if I do the work of understanding those biases so that I put them aside and just resonate with what you are sharing from the place that you are doing it? Isn’t that the promise of becoming enlightened is? I write that and it sounds weird. As if it was something that could be promised. Who is promising anything? I don’t know. It sounds weird. But it is what came. The promise that they gave us. The initial promise. The promise of being human being, and being able to ‘become enlightened’. The ultimate elimination of biases. Just letting people be. How would it look like to not filter the experience that we have of another human being? Of life itself? How would it feel like to start brand new in each second that comes by? I wonder, and it feels good to be in that wonder.

When there is someone that has Alzheimer’s, if they had people to care for them, but no one of their family that would expect them to be in a particular way, what would be their experience of life? I wonder this because it feels that a big part of the problems that are experienced because of alzheimer’s are because people expect other people to be in a particular way, and when they are not, there is disappointment. And no one likes being disappointed. No one likes having their expectations not met. Anyway. Just random thoughts that come right now.

What is the music that is being played in the world right now? What is what people like? It is very, very interesting to me that my little girl moves as she moves with raggaeton. It feels like there is something primal in there, something that moves the deepest fiber of the body. That’s something that I have been thinking these days. What is the role of music in this whole game? I have been very consistent with what I do, and that is the key for creativity. What happens if I give my whole existence, my whole being, to the creation of music? What if that was the place on which I expressed all of my being? There is nothing more important for me than music, that is something that has been expressed over an over in my life through my actions, and it is time for me to embrace that and start creating from there. Devote my lifetime to the creation of cool music. To the exploration of what happens if I just set my mind free from the boundaries of what has been until now and give myself the freedom to create music. Yes, that is what is deepest into my heart. I see art and I want to create everything, but is it really that what I want to do? Do I really want to try out every piece of software that exists so that I can build something from there, or do I want to craft the most amazing musical experiences in the world so that I can move people through the deepest parts of their realm of consciousness by that? That is the question that I have gotten the most throughout my life, after asking the questions that I tend to ask: Are you a musician? Which is your music? And everything that I care about revolves around music. I created a radio online with an algorithm which’s mission is to be the most random one of them all. The problem with it is that the interface is not cool enough, but the idea behind it is amazing. I just need to polish the way on which I present it to the world so that it can convey the message that I want to convey with it. This whole game that I’m playing here is about clarifying the message so that it can reach other people more clearly. That’s what I need to do. Reach out to people with more clarity. With more truth. That is the truth of who I am, that is the truth of what I’m bringing. Caring about music. Caring about the rhythm that moves the soul. The film that is going on inside me is clear. I go through the journey of breathwork, and in parallel I learn how to make music, so that afterwards I can build up transformational journeys using the breath and music as the means of going deeeeeeep. That is the thing. Crafting the whole experience. Once every week, do an open event to the whole world, a live stream in twitch, on which I share the music that I have created and a breathing. For all of those that want to go deep, for all of those that want to have fun. That is the story that I will tell. Holy shit, there are so many stories that I want to tell. There are so many, so many stories that I want to explore. To be part of. The alien that comes into youtube and does the sports that he sees in there is also a cool one. What if I had an AI motion capture to digital movement system in place that could record the movements that I do and transfer them to a digital avatar and with that create something cool? What is the story that I could create on the background of that whole story? Yes. I feel that the story of the alien is a cool one. The one that wants to change the world, just bringing stuff into the world that is already here. Just shining a light into what is here. That is what curator is about. That is what curating content is. Showcasing it for different people. And the thing is that it doesn’t really matter which is the content. What is the sport being made, that is a construct of the mind that wants to optimize everything. Which is the absolute best workout that I could go through today so that I can bring more and more of training into what I do, so that I could become more and more fit. That is only a construct of the mind. The important thing is the experience, and the story that is being told with the experience. It doesn’t even matter which youtube video it is, what matters only is that it happens. And if I build this story around this character to bring more consciousness to the world, more practices, more stuff, it is going to be amazing. And it can be a whole team of them. One that practices yoga, another one that meditates, another one that does creative work, another one that plays music, another one that does X, another one that cooks. It is just the stories that we tell ourselves, but there is a lot of value on these stories. Stories are everything, and the fact that I need ai motion capture for doing this is just because of the stories that can be told with it. That is the magic. And the technology will get better and better, it is just a matter of time. It is just about giving the space for it to become better, and realize where we are moving towards. The metaverse will be a real thing, and what will happen in there is a collection of humans gathering to do something cool. That’s just what it is. And with a cool ai motion capturer it will get cooler and cooler. That’s just what comes. That is something important that I need to have in mind as I create whatever I am creating. Which is the place where I see humanity moving towards? What will be in place in a few years? Which are the stories that will be told? Which are going to be the stories that are in place? Those are all interesting things, and what is important to have in mind is that aliens don’t need to come in physical form. They can just be a representation, a digital representation of something that comes. If I show you a video of an alien, how different is that from actually having the alien here? It happened with my friend that I met online and then in person: was there any difference? She was the same person that I knew, the same person that I expected, and there is a lot of value in this. True wealth. And a big avenue for exploration, for becoming more and more of what we are by sharing stories that resonate with what we can be. That resonate with where we are heading towards. The great reset doesn’t come from writing about it, it comes from creating fun stuff that is related to it. People won’t read this book. They won’t care about it. It is too much. I don’t even understand it. The important thing is not the book itself, it is what happens because of the book. It is the foundations that the book is establishing. That is why it is called manifesto. This are the foundations over which the future will be built. This is where the magic comes from. We need better stories, that are embedded in our culture. We need a better way of telling stories. That’s what the DAO will be about. The stories that are going to be told, everywhere, in each part of the world, for people to have fun. For people to engage in their community. For each city to have a place where people can come together and just create fun and cool stuff. That’s what they need. To create fun and cool stuff. That’s everything. Nothing else matters. The important thing is the every day. What happens from one moment to the next one. How reality is built on top of the small actions, the small decisions, and how all of those determine how we experience this game. That is the wealth, that is it.

Taking a picture of our world today and witnessing how it can change because of the energy that we can put into the stories that will drive the future. Which are those stories.
