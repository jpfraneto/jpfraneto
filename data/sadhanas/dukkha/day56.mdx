Coming back to write feels the good thing to do, now that my baby is sleeping. Today has been an important day, on which I guided my second breathwork session and I’m getting more and more out of it. It feels amazing to have something that feels like the gathering of everything that I have done in my life so that I can help another person to just be in peace with who he or she is right there, right now. Every session that we go through is an exploration into the present moment, into what is alive, and into the integration that comes forth as we open up the space for healing. And I’m not even too comfortable with using this words, right now what comes as more natural is speaking about integration. At the end of the day, all that healing is a process which’s final result or aim should be to clarify in the life of the person that is being part of it what it means to live with consciousness anchored in the present moment. I’m using those terms a lot, because that is how it feels. That’s the information that is coming right now. That is what has been present in my own experience after all the explorations into the void that I have gone through. The importance of living in the present. Ultimately you can have all the connections with the infinite that you want, you can be navigating every dimension that is out there for many times, but how do you use that experience to enhance your life? To live better? That is what my intention is as I guide each of these persons, and until now the experience has been great. I’m very happy for what has happened, and I feel very connected with the process. It is a deep inspiration to keep doing my own personal work, so that I can be there more and more for those that I will work with.

It is all about becoming a mirror, and helping those that I work with the see themselves at that mirror. When I go into the session there is a certain tendency in me to feel a little bit awkward because of not knowing what to say, or a slight tendency to feel that there is something that I should say and I’m not saying. That I should be pointing the person towards something that I’m not doing it. But eventually I realize that what is needed from me is just the capacity for holding the space, for holding up the mirror for that person to be able to look at him/herself, and through that, integrate everything that is inside into a new way of being. That’s why it makes me happy that after each of these sessions they have asked me to be alone. To not say anything, and just be with themselves. That is what makes me feel good, to help them develop the capacity for just being with themselves. It is difficult for people nowadays to be with themselves, within all the distractions that are in place. So I’m doing my thing, and it seems to be working. And it also seems that it is my way out of this whole maze of Dukkha, because it is a practical way on which I can be in service in the world. Through this work, I can be in service, and that is something that I have been wanting to happen for a long time. At the retreat in one moment I had the realization that the way on which I was going to wake up was by being in service to others, and this feels like the way on which I can do that. I’m very grateful for it. It feels like I’m moving in the right direction.

And then I think about the power that this can have if I’m able to create the podcast every day with a new guest, and use the episode as an introduction to the album that then we can listen together as I guide the person through a breathwork session that can be the most important moment of her life. I’m looking to that future in the horizon, one on which I’m able and have the capabilities and knowledge and skill to mix music as I’m being part of the session, and mix in there pieces of wisdom, or this or that. There are infinite opportunities lying ahead, and I’m very eager to explore them all. It looks like a very promising future. I feel that I’m developing a skill that will bring something important to the world.

It has been a great day, I feel in peace. The sensations that I have in my brain are there, for sure, but there is an aspect of them that seems to be dissolving. Yesterday night we went to the cinema and I was there and I realized that there was a bit of tension in myself as I was watching the movie, and I was able to release that tension and feel that release in my whole being. It is crazy how I am more and more able to notice the tension, and what comes after that. I guess that this is part of what it means to live life from a level of different awareness, being able to be the witness of myself with more clarity. Of every aspect of who I am. Realizing each of those aspects, and integrating them as part of my reality in that moment. Not judging. Just being with it. And I know that I’m moving in that direction, and because of that I know that I’m more and more capable of living in the present moment. I remember Adyashanti that spoke in the book ‘The end of your world’ about these being windows on which consciousness goes astray (I’m not being literal, this is what I remember, or the concept that stuck with me), but you get more and more capable of realizing that that happen and in that moment you come back and live in the present. And that keeps happening until the window on which you have a thought and the moment on which you realize that that is a thought gets smaller and smaller, until there is a point on which it is practically non-existent. And that is what I have inside when I digest this process that I’m going through, because each of those unconscious aspects of myself that are being manifested and noticed with more clarity are the ones that don’t let me be with my consciousness here and now. And as that happens more and more, I became more free from what is actually not here. Free from what I’m not. All of those thoughts that I was identified with (or am still) are not part of who I am. They are a construct that my structure of personality has built upon my experience as a human being, they are an addition to my experience as a human being, but they are not who I am. Who I am is beyond those thoughts, is beyond any conceptualization, it is just an expression. And every time that I sit down in a session with a person that I’m walking with and I start thinking is a moment on which there is a doubt about what is happening there, so I stop actually being present. I start being through my thoughts, and that is not the truth of my existence. That is only the mirage of the character that I’ve been playing, the one that wants to be right, the one that is built as the egoic self that wants to be loved.

The deepest work that I can do now is use each one of those spaces as the means by which I’m able to leave myself aside and become more and more present for those that I’m working with. Become more and more present so that I can be more and more of a mirror for them. That is the process that I’m going through, and guiding people in this sessions with the breath is and will be a major enhancer of my whole process of evolution. Being there for other consciousness being manifested through the experience of other person is like magic. And I’m grateful that I can do that work, that I can be there for them, and that I can walk with them. I’m grateful to have found this way of manifesting who I am by helping others become more of who they are. I’m grateful for just being who I am, and for the path that I have walked that has got me to this point. I’m grateful for my family, who are the ones that give me the strength and opportunity to be walking this path.

Those who came a lot today during my morning meditation were my ancestors. Or the ancestors, in a more generic way. The acknowledgement that everything that I am right now is a consequence of all of what they did is something very strong, deep and powerful, and I’m very happy to be able to give them my energy by letting that manifestation arise in my relationship with them. Because I am being because of them. I am part of them, right here, right now, and it is just by fully integrating my life experience that I will be able to become who I’m destined to be. I’m destined to be the full manifestation of what happens through me, and I’m getting more and more connected to that, as I express my gratitude to them by just Doing The Work. I’m very motivated to Do it. Yesterday I arrived to the house very late (for my standards), at 12:30 am, and I just sat down and did the breathing exercise. And it has not been hard at all to stay away from drinking alcohol, or smoking pot. It is just part of what is being done by me right now, and I embrace it and feel good with it. It feels that it is not an option for me right now to drink, and with that door closed there is an openness in another realm. I feel that the last years I have been doing a huge work, but there was an aspect that was missing in it, and it was related to my relationship with these substances. As I become more and more free from them, from the tendencies inside me that make me think of them as a gateway for entertainment in moments of being with people that I consider boring, I open up more and more the opportunity for being in the present moment. For me, and then for others.

I’m Doing The Work, with the motivation and inspiration that comes from knowing that I’ll have that meeting on which I will be there for others. And they need me. And that is what keeps me in this loop of staying away from pot or alcohol. Knowing that I’m being part of this process and that it is important for me to do it. And also… I haven’t done it in a long time: Which could be the harm of quitting those substances for 3 months? There is only learning to be had, experiences to be lived, and more consciousness to be brought. And my work will have that impact also inside, as I more more and more into the direction of being true to what I’m doing. To be true with the necessity that is inside me for expression. For being myself. For bringing my truth into what I do. My writing is an expression of who I am, right here, right now, and as I do more and more of the work I’ll be more and more able to focus as sharply as a laser when I decide to do it. And that is the amazing thing about it. Presence is a decision. I choose to experience this moment. I choose to be here, right now, and to just be who I am through these words. It is not me pretending to be someone different, it is not me pretending to be manifested in a way that I’m not. It is just me, being me, and being able to be more of me with more ease. The last year each time that I sat down to code I had to go through more and more of a ritual, and right now I’m in the afternoon at the house of my parents and I’m using this time that my little girl fell asleep to come here to write. I’m becoming more and more efficient in my craft, by just being able to do it when I have time available to. This enables me to feel way less pressure, because before I had all this need for coding 4 hours, if not there was a very bad feeling inside me. Now, if I’m not able to do it, it is ok. I tried my best. I lost my best words, but it is ok. It is part of it. I can’t be writing all day long. I have to give up the opportunity of bringing all of my existence into the paper, because that is not how creativity works. It needs to be replenished by giving space. By resting. That is how it can arise again, by just giving it space for it to arise. And I’m giving that space, by staying in bed until later with my wife, by coming here and having this lunch with my parents, etc. I’m true to my word of committing to my writing, but I’m not completely attached to it. I have been there, and it feels limiting. It is not how it works anymore. Of course I need it, it is something that feels like I need to get out of me, but if I don’t do it the world will not end. It will keep its flow, and it is going to be alright. Everything is going to be alright.

It is just incredible to witness how I have developed the capacity for coming here and writing whatever comes up all this time. It is just incredible to see how able I have become to just show up and share what is inside. It feels like I’m draining myself, and it feels like it won’t end. Of course, there have been moments on which I have told myself that I will end up my creative streak and I won’t be able to write anymore, but here I am, on day 56, and I keep doing it without any problem. I’m demonstrating empirically that it is possible to be creative without limits, the only important part about it is to show up. It is to be there for myself, for my own process, and be willing to share what is present. There will be days on which the creation will suck, in order for there to be days on which the outcome will be amazing. It is just part of this game, of the game of showing up to Do The Work and be the witness of what comes. The game afterward ends up being how to filter what was said in order to have the most sense possible, but I don’t really know how to do that. There is not an aspect of myself that knows what will happen after day 88, there is only the aspect of myself that shows up and keeps doing the thing. May I be naïve because of what I’m doing, may it never help anyone, it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is that it exists, that it is, and that I am being through this. Here, right now, I am being through each and every one of these words. I’m manifesting myself through the creative act. I’m learning more and more about myself through the act of creation. And that is the magic. That is what I have always needed. To show up and trust. That is the biggest learning that I have gotten out of all these days and weeks of writing. The one that this process is for myself. Not to please others. Not to give answers to others. Just for myself, for manifesting into a reality that you can experience how deep into the maze of my own mind I am, and how that is expressed into everything that I do. And also how that is being dissolved as I move on and on out of it.

Other important thing that happened today was that the soccer world cup started. The one in Qatar. I have been away from soccer for a long time, thinking that my relationship with it had ended, but this week after buying for me a soccer ball after a long, long time I realized how much I missed it, and how much of myself I was not accepting because of that negation. So today I was very excited about it, and then came to the house of my father to watch the initial game and realized that it is truly boring for me now. I just can’t stand sitting down for 2 hours to watch a game anymore. It doesn’t make sense. But coming here and being a witness of that process of realization has been huge thing for me today. There has been an immense realization that comes from opening up to the integration of that and realizing that the role that it plays in my house is different that the one I expected. Today in the morning I was like a little boy waiting for santa claus waiting for the first game, and when it started, I realized that all of those emotions were part of the extrapolation that I was doing from the experiences that I have had in the past related to soccer. I was projecting those experiences into this moment, and because of that, I was very excited. Was that excitement real? For sure they were. And I enjoyed them a lot, and then when I was watching the game I realized that it was boring and I just moved on and did something different. I was present for those sensations, and that brings a lot of peace into myself. There is pace, because I opened up to the possibility of those sensations to come forth, and I integrated them in a way. I didn’t say ‘I’m over soccer now, I’m living a new life’. I just opened up to witness myself doing what I had done in the past, what had brought all those emotions before, and realized because of my reaction that it is not part of me anymore. It feels good. I feel very good about this realization. This was an important day.

And it keeps being an important day, because as I’m writing I’m feeling a lot of craving sensations for a piece of kuchen. I know that when my baby wakes up I’m going to tell her to go with me, and we are going to say goodbye to my parents house with a piece of kuchen, with a piece of what was eaten in the past here and just sharing that space with them. This house is being transformed soon, tomorrow they start building parts of it again, and it will be an acknowledgement to my grandparent to say goodbye to it in a way that honors everything that has happened here. Part of being grateful for all of what the ancestors did is to be there with the memories that they bring, with what happened with them, and I’m feeling all these cravings for that piece of kuchen and realizing that I will open up to the possibility of eating that sugar. I’m not attached to it, I love saying that I’m addicted to it, but for sure I’m not. I don’t have any problem to say no, it is not something that I desperately need, but more something that I allow myself right now to do. And that feels freeing. I guess that that is what freedom is about.
