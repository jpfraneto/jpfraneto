What is present in me today is the willingness to talk about the reasons of why I’m doing what I’m doing. What is behind this project. Which are the motivations that make me want to transform it into a reality. As I write, what comes up is the importance to recognize also what this project aims to bring into the world. How is it going to be different from what it is now from what is being built through these words? Who are the persons that I see being part of this, and how are they going to be transformed because of this whole thing? This are all questions that come to mind right now, and as I write that they come to mind I think: Are they truly coming to mind or are they just begin written? Because I’m not truly thinking about them, they are just happening. I’m just being through this words. Wasn’t that what I wanted? Wasn’t that what this whole game was about? Realizing my true nature so that I could be more present in all of my actions? I’m here, present, traveling through this moment as each stroke of the keys of this computer writes a new word. Everything that is happening right now is an exploration into everything that is, through each of these letters. Welcome to my mind. Welcome to my being. This is all of who I am. And I’m also you. It is time to recognize that.

The first word that comes to mind is community. The last two years have been for me about doing the work, showing up, but it has always been for myself, by myself, very isolated. In my own room, waking up early, and showing up. Not being able to share with too many people what is going on, because of the lack of people in my network which are going through a process like mine. I guess that there is actually no one in my network that is going through this. And it feels very lonely. And I feel that I always have to find out energy somewhere so that I can keep doing it. I have been able to do that, I have been able to keep showing up by recognizing the importance of doing it, but I also recognize that if I would have been able to do it in a different way it probably would have been more efficient. There is an amazing power on community, on being able to express, to bring out what is inside, and that is what I want to foster, to share, with this whole thing. There is a deep need for people to connect, to share with others that are on the same step of their path, or not in the same step, but at least traveling the same path. This gives energy to the whole process, and there is a feeling inside me that it makes awareness feel less alone. More complete. Energized. There is an aspect of being in community that is very important for this whole process, and in my experience there is a lack of that in this moment in the world. There are people that are doing their thing, helping as much as they can, but I feel it is not enough. Something bigger needs to happen, more energy needs to be focused, and Dukkha will be about that. It will be about tending hands, and being accountable to each other. Helping each other realize that they are not alone in their journey, and having someone to count on. To feel comfortable with. Someone that will want to help them get to where they want to get. I know that awakening is not about going somewhere, it is about discovering the truth of what has always been here, and always will, but you get the point… There is a path that needs to be walked, and this community, this energy, will be the concentration of those paths. It will be a vortex of energy of those who want to awake. And that is powerful in and of itself. The challenge is to create the means for that to happen, but there has not been a better moment for it than today. The internet and its tools are exploding. It is time. We are ready. The technology is getting there. As I have written in other places, blockchain will help its get rid of the samsara’s of society that won’t let energy flow freely, and with that, comes a new stage in human evolution. The truth will come forth, as more and more people open up themselves to being true, to being what they have always have been. Without filters, without second interpretations. We will be there for all of those who want to be truth. For all of those who want to live from that truth.

That is what awakening is about. Opening yourself to the possibility of living life from your own truth, whatever it is. Being able to see what is going on without the filters of what should be. Opening to what is. And navigating this whole adventure from there. If you want to be part of Dukkha, that is the game for which you are signing up. The game of facing the truth, the game of making the hard decisions. This whole process will show you some uncomfortable stuff, really uncomfortable stuff, but by being there for each other we can navigate it together. All the doors will be open, and all will come out. Are you ready for facing that? I’m sure you aren’t. No one is. That’s why we’ve got to become no one. Each one of us needs to become no one. That’s the game.

That leads me to the next one. This place also exists as an exploration into the unknown. Into what can happen when you let energy move freely throughout a particular system. Dukkha will be an open vortex of energy, that will be transformed by the input of each one of the persons that decide to be part of it. That give part of their life force to the pursuit of its mission. What I’m doing here, with this words, is establishing the first way on which this movement of energy will flow, but no one know what it will look like in the future. That is where the unknown lies. In that not knowing, there is a huge space for exploration. Into what can be. With the input of each one of us. Marveling together by what this will become. There is a lot of beauty in the unknown, when you start realizing that each moment is Ann opportunity to get a stronger grasp of that fact. I don’t even know what the next phrase will look like, what it will say. Every word that I write is an exploration into the present, by sharing what shows up, by sharing what comes up. Opening myself to this is helpful, is a miracle, and it is acknowledging the unknown in every second. If I came here and started ‘should-ing’ about which words should be written, this whole unknown-bigness aspect would become kind of conflicted. And Idon’t want that, I want this to be as sincere as possible, as pure as possible, so that it can convey a message that talks to your soul. Not to who you think you are, but to who you truly are. There is an intention of communicating from soul to soul here. Open up to what that communication is trying to say, because it will bring about stuff inside you that you don’t even know exists. It is a miracle. It is the miracle of the present moment, it is the miracle of the exploration into the present moment. Into everything that is. Everything that has bee is already here, present through reality in this moment, and everything that will be is an open window of opportunity that is build moment after moment with every decision that is made by every one of us. Make those decisions count. How? By being responsible for them. By being the witness of your own actions, and making them conscious. Step by step, walking the path of being more conscious about what you do. Whatever you do, do it because you feel it. In the depths of your being. In your belly. In your gut. Listen to your gut, there is way more information there than what you expect. Listen to your body. There is way more information there than what you expect.

Life is a miracle, and it speaks to us through everything that happens, in every moment. See each interaction with life, with yourself, as a window into eternity. As a stepping stone into living a life more connected with what you came here to be. With who you came here to be. You are a miracle. It is time to wake up from the dream.

Another motivation behind the project is to have fun. Something that has been present always inside here is an invitation to celebration. The work has to be done, but there also needs to be a space for celebration. It is never enough to acknowledge this. Every deep work period, every transformational journey, will end up in a celebration. It won’t be a graduation as we are used to, a boring ceremony on which each of us will come up and receive its own prized that remind us the competitiveness of the whole system. Nope, not at all. Each person will have its space for sharing how the whole process was transformational, and the means by which that sharing will be done is by creation. Each person will create something that will add beauty to the world, whatever that may be. There are no boundaries, but it needs to be something new. Something original. Something that comes from the dipping of the toe into the ocean of the true nature of that person. That ocean is the infinite source of creative expression, it is where all ideas come from, it is where the muses are doing their dance and waiting for each of us to become free and touch that inspirational universe. This whole project is built for that to happen, and the closing ceremony of each journey will be a space on which each person will be able to share what they have created. What was transformed inside them, what was opened, and what is brought to the world because of that. A key component of this whole thing is connecting to creativity, since that is the ultimate goal of the human being. For the soul to express itself through us. Through each one of us. This adventure will be about lowering the barriers for creation, so that each of us can shine through that. It will be about embracing the creative expression of each other. And building from there. The world is an amazing place, and with this whole NFT universe we can create unique digital expressions that can become the footprint that we leave in the world. Each ‘end project’ will be a testament of the journey that was walked. Each of them sharing its unique spark. Being saved in the blockchain forever, as each of us mint their new creations for the world to see.

All that turning around the corners to talk about celebration. Each journey will end up with a huge party, on which musicians from all over the world will share their art and creations and make us have the best time of our lives. It will be the three days on which Jesus died and then was reborn, the three days on which each of us will die and then be reborn. We will go through this transformational journey together, learning how to die, so that we can die in those celebrations and then come up at the other side as new human beings. As renewed expressions of consciousness. A huge part of doing the work is acknowledging the effort that comes about doing it, and celebrating the fact that you were able to do it. It is so easy to get caught up in the momentum of just doing doing doing the work, and that is away from what this whole thing is about. This thing is about bringing forth what is true inside you, and that is deeply connected with joy. With pure joy. With the pure joy of dancing, of being free. Of creating. Of not doing the work, but of being the work. Let the work be part of who you are, for the true transformation comes when there is no more work to be done. Life becomes the work, because each interaction that you have is an invitation to explore deeper into who you are, through the eyes of the interaction itself.

If you are talking to your wife, see yourself through the eyes of your wife.
If you are remembering who your father was, see yourself through the eyes of your father. Through each of his life experiences, for they constitute who you are.
If you are having a conversation with a total stranger, see yourself in what that stranger is telling you, because each part of that interaction is giving you more information about human nature, about what constitutes you.

Each aspect of life becomes the work, and each part of it gives you valuable information about how to progress. About how to be more present. At the end, it is not about finding time to do the work. It is to learn to live the work. To be the work. To embody the work of being present. Of being presence. Of just being. That is all what the world needs from you, that is all what you need from you. Just to be you. Just to be. You are everything that you have always been. Realize that, and celebrate. Dance. Have fun. Enjoy. We came here to enjoy. That is what Dukkha is about, to realize deeply that fact, to the core of our being. To get free from the bondages of our own suffering, and ask yourself the question: Who is suffering? Ask yourself that question till there is no one there. Let what stays speak for itself. Let what stays just be itself. And let us all regocijate in the acknowledgment of what we all already are.

How do you imagine a world on which each of us is free from the conditioning of the mind?

How do you imagine a world on which each of us is free from how their life experience has built up an automatic reaction for everything that happens?

How do you imagine a world on which you are aware of how you react and you are able to determine how you will react based on how you _truly_ feel, deep inside?

How do you imagine a world without should’s, without expectations, and just with expressions?

How do you imagine a world on which judgments are something that we acknowledge and laugh about?

How do you imagine a world on which each of us is able to recognize how crazy we are, and we join forces into that understanding?

How do you imagine a world on which each of us is compassionate towards itself?

How do you imagine a world on which each of us is able to connect to the creative source, and has the means for throwing that creativity into the world?

How do you imagine a world based on trust?

How do you imagine a world based on community?

How do you imagine a world where you are seen by who you are?

How do you imagine a world where your CV is a ever present evolution because it is who you truly are?

How do you imagine a world on which we see children as masters?

That is the world we are trying to build here. That is the aim of this whole thing. To develop a program that can help each of its participants to recognize who they truly are, by using specific tools and techniques that have been designed and developed throughout the whole history of humanity as the means by which we can better connect with ourselves. That is the journey that we need to start now, the connection to ourselves. The journey within. Dukkha is all about traveling within, and then finding the trust and connection in the community to share what was seen in there. To bring it about, so that it can stop being something unconscious and it transforms itself into something conscious. As part of who you decide to be. This thing is about deciding who you want to be, at each moment, in every situation. In every relationship. It is a process, it ain’t easy, but that’s why you are not alone. That’s why there will be a whole community built around this specific mission.

And then there is the importance of sharing what has been learned. Each of us, as early adopters, will play an important role within our own communities. It doesn’t help if you become awake and then keep everything that you realize for yourself. You’ve got to share yourself. You’ve got to be open to see others, and to do the work of helping your community become more connected to what is going on in every part of it. Each of us will become the holder of a strong power, and that power has to be spread for it to be stronger. And that is the key role of community, of holding spaces for people to walk the path that we will pave. We are the early adopters, the ones that will go first, and it is our role to open up the doors of that path for the ones that want to walk it afterwards. And it will be fun. It will be fun to share with other members of the community what will come up. This will be a worldwide movement, and in the acknowledgment of that there is space for exploration also. On how different places of the world react to this. Whatever ‘this’ ends up being. We don’t know yet. No one knows yet. It doesn’t matter really. What matters is that it happens. What matters is that it is already happening. Open up for the mystery. And see what comes at the other side. Awareness is eager to realize itself, and we will be there for that to happen.

And the good thing is that the least you know, the more advanced you are because you don’t have the concepts of the mind making noise in there for you to expect something particular to happen. That is something that happens a lot to me, as I know more and more about this whole thing, my mind gets stronger and stronger, and it is harder to let it go. To transcend it. I realize that I’m always expecting something to happen, and from my mind trying to get to a particular place. But that is not the game, the gate cannot be stepped in by the mind. There needs to be a dropping of the mind, but I don’t really know how to do it. And I’m kind of OK with it. I know there is something out there that I truly want to experience, I know that it is calling me, and I also know that I have done everything that I can to understand what to do to move towards it. And on saying those words come the amazing part, the incredible part, because I speak about understanding. And this is not about understanding, it is about experiencing. I can’t understand what this thing is about, because it is beyond the mind. Every understanding comes from the mind, and this thing lies in another realm. That’s the biggest trick of them all. The big joke. I’m waiting for that joke to show itself to me, but every day I realize more and more that it is not going to in the way I expect. I dress up because this is the day on which I will realize my true nature, and then come back to my house with my shiny dress disappointed because it didn’t happen. Whatever ‘it’ means. So many disappointments, and I don’t really know how to avoid them. There is always this expectation for ‘it’ to happen. For that moment to finally arrive. Should I do something in my meditation? My mind no tells me that I shouldn’t. Doing is not the way. But how not to do? How can you approach a particular situation without ‘doing’ something? I don’t really have a clue. I’m confused. I’m really confused. But not enough. I need to be more confused. I need to be lost in that confusion so deep that there is no way out. And the only way in is through. Through that confusion is the way. So I will become more confused. Perhaps writing in a weird way is the step forward for more confusion to come forth:

What
Is
This
Thing?

What am
I
Doing?

How can you. Do this?

It doesn’t make any sense.

Should it make sense?

What is sense about?

The only
Thing
That
Matters
Is
The
Truth

From there we go on. Let’s go. It’s time to move on. It’s time to enjoy being confused. It’s time to enjoy throwing out whatever comes. Painting the wall with it and then stepping back and realizing: Holy shit, that was me. But who is me? Who is the one asking that question? Who is the one that asks? Who is the one that writes? I don’t really know. Who is that I?

This is how crazy the mind is. This are all the tales that it tells itself, that it manifests, in order to stay in charge. In order to continue playing the game, to continue being on this dream. But it is getting funnier and funnier, as the realization comes that it truly doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter to be the dumb person in the room. There is no one to be impressed. Life has given that opportunity, to just explore, and through that exploration, become free. Free from wanting to be someone, free from wanting to accommodate myself in a particular way of being. Free from fitting into the expectations that others may have of me being someone particular. Free from fitting into the expectations of who I should be. Free of should-ing. Open to just being. The antidote to should is being. The antidote for searching is being. The antidote for becoming is being. The antidote for the mind is to witness the mind, express gratitude and move forward acknowledging that I’m not it. I am separate from it, in a dimension that I can’t understand yet because it is still there all ever present, doing its job of defending myself.

Thank you mind, for always being there defending myself. You did an amazing job throughout life. I very much appreciate it. But it is time to open up now, to open up to the infinite world of possibilities that lie at the other side of being defensive. To open up to what comes when there is absolute oppeness, and non attachment to the consequences of the actions. When every action is manifested just for the sole need of expression, more than anything else. More than for working towards a particular ends. The end is just here, right now. This is all what is needed. To experience life through an eternal end. The end of being present. The end of being presence. That is all what is needed. Being present. Being presence. That is the game of life. Move and move and move towards the realization that all what matters is what is here, and now. Nothing more than this. If you reads these words and you are feeling a particular way, just enjoy it. Just feel it. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Open yourself to the bliss, however it may manifest in you. There are no should’s, there are only truths. The truths of being. The truths of creating in community. The truths of opening to the ultimate expression of creativity: What comes when there is no head. On having no head. Where do we go when there is no head? What remains when there is no head? Just explore that. You minus you. What remains? Explore that question until the truth comes forth. Until there is no doubt about the answer. Realize your own nature and create. Create whatever your heart tells you to create. Explore into that. Make mistakes. There truly are no mistakes, just opportunities for growth. Just opportunities for growing, for stepping into each moment, into each opportunity with the open mind that will bring forth a deeper exploration of who you are. Of who you have always been.

Who gave you back a look from the mirror when you were a baby?
Who was the one brushing those teeth and thinking about life in the mirror of that bathroom?
Who has been looking back at you from the mirror since you were born?

Realize the truth. You are the one that has always been there. Awareness has always been there. It is not the mind, it is awareness. Awareness is what has been all this time giving you that look back. What happens when awareness realizes itself? Wake up from the dream, and answer that question for yourself. It is time. It has always been time. The mind is only the interface with which awareness interacts with the material reality. This universe is mental. Everything is mind. Everything is a different aspect of mind. What happens when there is no gravity? What stays when there is no gravity? Experience the absence of gravity with all of what you are. Are you still there? Who is that you that is still there? Realize the truth, and be free.

Experience what true freedom is about.

Experience what it means to break free from the bondages of your past.

Experience what it means to be no one.

Experience what it means to die.

Learn to die before you die.

Be free.

This whole thing is about becoming more of what you have always been. Recognize that look that comes from the mirror and ask yourself. Who is that? Who is looking at me?

When was the last time that you spent 5 minutes staring at yourself at the mirror? What if you did it right now? Go for it, no one will laugh at you more than yourself. No one is watching. The bathroom is a sacred place, where you can be not interrupted. Give you that time for yourself, and enjoy what comes back. Enjoy the look that comes back, and recognize in it the child that has always been present in you. The one that was running through childhood, just exploring what it meant to be alive. The one that was open towards the world, willing to receive what it gave. The one that built those defense mechanisms as a tool for survival. Recognize that you are not those defense mechanisms. Those were a necessary step into who you are, but you are not them anymore. Break free from them, by making conscious what is in the unconscious. By feeling back everything that once was felt, and letting it be part of who you are right now. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Let those emotions come back at you, in each moment, and give yourself the permission to experience them fully. Cry, if you need to cry. Laugh, if you need to laugh. Everything is permitted. We will be there for each other. It is time to be transparent. The truth is about accepting all that is. Everything that was once surpassed will come forth, in one way or another, and it is time to face it. To integrate it as part of what this whole game is. The truth is about integrating everything that has ever been, by being grateful for it constituting what you are in this moment.

That trauma that you suffered when you were young? It is a window within.

Every aspect of our experience as human beings is a window within. Realize that, and be willing to open that window. We will be there for you. If you feel the call, open up and be there for others. Join this adventure. It will be fun. More than fun, it will be important. Full of emotions that you never let you feel. Full of emotions that were suppressed. Full of emotions that have been there all this time, waiting for being fully experienced so that they can be integrated. We are full of incomplete experiences, which stay within the system as noise that won’t let the energy flow freely. This doesn’t let our true self to express itself through our actions. Complete those experiences by fully feeling them, and let your Self shine through each one of your actions. You came here to be free. It is time to do the work, to set you free.

That is what this whole thing is about: Doing the work, one next to the other, and with that, evolve.

Into what we truly are, into what we have always been.

It is time to awake.

It is time to be.

It may be scary. The amount of energy that is trapped inside the system is huge. And letting it free may be overwhelming. I’m going through that right now. Each time that I sit down and meditate it seems like there is something that wants to happen and there is always this feeling inside that I’m not ready for it. But it ends up looking like opening a tunnel out from jail with a spoon, ‘Shawshank Redemption’ style. And they ended up doing it finally. They were eventually free. I know that I will eventually become free, it is just a matter of time. But it is fucking scary. It is something completely new, unknown, and scary. Not knowing what is at the other side. Facing that fear with the help of masters, with the help of sacred medicines, and realizing that it is the deepest fear that has ever been experienced by this structure. The fear of ceasing to exist. The existential fear of not being. Of being no one. Is that the primal fear? I guess so, at least it feels like that. But the spoon is strong, and it goes further and further each day, ever realizing that there is ultimately nothing to fear. That fear is all in the mind. Awareness has never been afraid. It is just aware. There. Timeless. But I haven’t been able to realize that from my own experience, so the fear is always there. Expressing itself by all the means possible.

But so many others have died before. Most of us have died. And what ended up happening? Life continues. It always finds its path forward. What happens if I open up to the possibility of dying? I become free from death. Is that the ultimate freedom? I don’t really know, but a part of me that is growing with every spoon of cement that comes out really wants to experience it. Not know, but experience. Realize that it is all a dream. All this fear is part of it, part of the dream, part of the story that has been told. What if we are really paving the road toward eternity, towards immortality, by realizing that death is only an illusion?

And from there comes the acknowledgment of AGI: Artificial General Intelligence. Part of this project needs to have a research station for that, because there is a deep sensation that the realization of this technology will come from the evolution of consciousness that happens when awareness become aware of itself at the most-of-humans level. My teacher said that some buddhist traditions speak about the next incarnation of the buddha as something beyond human, and all the pointers come to this place. It is necessary to explore this avenue within the DAO, because what will happen here will bring about new ways of relating to the development of this whole thing that have not been explored yet.

What comes out of the intersection of AGI and awakening? That is one of the biggest questions that this DAO will be willing to explore. To add its small piece into the realization of the answer by experience, by building, by creating the answer line of code to line of code. And how does it integrate with humanity? The answers will also be here, within this community of people that are willing to experience and embody truth.

There also needs to be research done in the sphere of Turing tests and how computer recognize a human as a human. There is a feeling that the answer of this lies on training ML models with videos of people participating in self inquiry dyads, because it is one of the most human-like things that exist. Maybe that is not true, because a musician playing the music is also absolute human. Maybe the most human thing is to be in the state of flow. Being no one. Being just the action that is being performed. Perhaps the most human thing is just being. That is where the action is. How could a ML learning model be trained with this in mind? What is that what makes a human human? Will it matter in the future? Will it make a difference? It feels like controlling again. Why do I want to put myself in the shoes of a controller? Let it just be. It will know how to understand if a human is human if it wants. There is no need to worry about this. It will know.

So many uncertainties about how things will unfold, and of course there is a certain anxiety related to this. That controlling of the mind is always there, those stories that are told, those future that are built within the mind. But each of those futures is just a theory, something to walk towards, but not a reality. Which is the best way to walk towards that future? How to do it? My answer to that is just what I’m doing right now, writing down whatever comes to mind because that is my interpretation of the answer to that question of how to progress. It doesn’t really matter how to progress, and all what is being written points towards that fact. Just let it happen. Let it be.

Sleep with it. Let it flow throughout your system. Feel how it feels, and get to know yourself better through that process. Let your whole being guide towards the answer, in each moment, by giving you the guidance that you need in order to know how to progress. That is my take on intuition: As you free yourself from the mind, you become more and more connected to reality just as it is, which gives you a bigger opportunity to react from a place of truth within yourself. Intuition is not something magical that comes from the outside, it is the unfolding of wisdom that is produced inside you as you become more and more free of conditioning.

Build up that space for it to unfold. Create the conditions within your life for it to unfold. That is what Dukkha is about. For creating conditions for that unfolding using specific techniques that can foster the relationship with the Self. The consequence of that is becoming more intuitive, more connected to what is, more attuned to the true nature of reality. More connected to your truth.

If something feels intuitive, at first you may start doubting it. But as you become more and more attuned, you realize that it is actually you that is giving yourself the guidance needed to progress. And then the consequences of what happening show themselves as something that resonates with what you are, so it feels good. This starts a feedback loop that is positive, which helps you become more and more attuned with what you are. You feel more intuitive, because you start doing things that take you to places where you actually feel good.

That is the whole game: Learning to listen to the cues that your own experience gives to you. Each piece of information that unfolds in front of your aware experience is a window for that exploration. A window towards the path of becoming more intuitive. Have you ever felt how it feels to do something because you feel it inside, and then watching the consequences of that in your reality? What does the memory of that bring to you in this moment? Let’s bring more of that. This is what this whole thing is about.

To learn to trust ourselves, and what our inside tells us. That is the amazing game.

An ancient story comes to mind, one on which a small rock was next to a bird. The bird tells the rock: ‘What are you doing there?’.

- I’m just doing my thing, being a rock.

- Can I be next to you and sing?

- Be my guest.

So the bird starts singing, and then the rock transform itself into a nice wisp of light. The bird can’t believe what it is witnessing, but it continues to sing what comes to it, and the wisp becomes more and more alive until it fills the whole existence with its light. And there it is, the bird singing and singing, until it gets to a point where he realized that the rock is not there anymore and the singing fades and the rock suddenly comes back and the bird asks:

- What was that? Where did you go? What did you transform in?

- I’ve always been here, it’s all in your mind.

Become free of your mind, and let reality transform into magic in front of your eyes. Unbelievable things are going to start happening, and as soon as the mind steps in to try to make sense of them, they’ll stop. So train yourself to not understand. Train yourself to just trust. And magic will unfold in front of your eyes. You won’t have to tell anyone about it, because it will be inside you and there is no need for it. Just enjoy it with all your being, you are worthy of it. Each of us is worthy of it. You have always been. Just continue singing, just continue doing your thing, just continue being, and let reality unfold in front of you.
