Today I want to write about Social Media as a spiritual practice. That is what is the most present in me these days, as I open myself to the possibility of sharing my voice, sharing what I know and where I have got with my internal work. It has been all internal work, and I have not been able to create an outlet with which to share all that has happened with the world. To add value to myself and to other people in the process. They say that this game is about giving and receiving, and because of my incapacity to be an active part of the game we are playing as a society right now I was holding back. I was not realizing the power that publishing content has. And now I’m beginning to realize it, and be open to what comes at the other side. And it feels very good to be able to interact with other people.

Twitter is amazing, because it gives you the opportunity to be there with other people, no matter where they are on their journey. In one sense, it is very similar to meditation, because you can sit down in a zendo with people that have any kind of experience. It doesn’t matter where they are in the journey, what matters is only that they show up. And the same is valid for twitter, because in the timeline it doesn’t matter how much progress you’ve made on the thing, where you are at with it. The only thing that matters is how much value you are adding to the people that will read whatever you write. And this is huge. It truly is similar to meditation, because what you have written before doesn’t matter too much, it only matters what is there. Approaching the thing with beginners mind opens up a lot of doors. It is the way through.

It is all about adding value to the collective. It is about creating stuff that can make the conversation go further. I mean, this can be applied in any way because there are also people that go there just to throw out shit and be negative, but you get to meet the people that you meet because of how you interact with the platform. It is similar to how life work in many senses, and I feel that it is opening a lot of doors to me. I have a strong urge in my life to have conversations that are meaningful, and to grow as a human being because of the interaction with other people that I feel connected with. Here, I can meet this people, interact with how they think (by what they publish), and learn about life in the process. That is at the core of what social media is, and now I realize how much I was holding back of myself because of not participating in this game.

And it also bring into myself a lot of self-awareness, because of what I have to be a witness in myself. For example, today in the morning I had a strong urge to go in and see my notifications, to have that spike in dopamine, and I was able to be a witness of that and don’t fall into that trap. So I’m understanding how valuable it can be also in the aspect of being a witness of my own mind and how it works, and that is very valuable also.

Part of me goes back to the time on which I was not active in any social media and how good it was in many ways, but what was I missing in those moments that I have now? There are so many opportunities in this moment, which are open because of being part of them, and the most important thing for me right now is learning how to establish a healthy balance with the whole thing. It will be important for me to develop this balance, as always, so that I can thrive.

There is a big aspect of myself related to polarities that is also very clear with my interaction with this thing. I tend to say black or white. I do it every day, or I don’t do it at all. And that is what I’m not realizing, that I don’t need to be too extreme with the way on which I interact with the platform. I don’t need to be there all the time, and I can still do other things. I can still build Dukkha at the same time that I’m participating in the conversation in Twitter, it is not about black or whites. It is about finding balance, always, and using it as a tool, not as an end. I’m not sure if I fit into the whole content creator motto, and if it is the way to go for me, but it doesn’t really matter, because the world will not end tomorrow if I don’t do it properly. Life always gives new opportunities, and in here, every day is a new opportunity to start fresh. That is something that I need to realize completely, and embrace, because my black/white mentality makes me think that everything will be decided in one moment. As if it was like that. It is not like that. Every day is a new opportunity, and the fact that I think that something that I do is THAT important is coming because I’m experiencing reality as if I was at the center of it.

But I’m not. I’m just another ant in the colony, trying to make its way through the maze as good as I can. We are all making sense of this whole thing, and in that understanding there is progress to be made. There is empathy to be developed, and love for the process to be experienced. We are all in there at the same time, running around the circles of the same stuff, the same wisdom, and the important thing is finding new ways to convey it so that it stucks deeper.

That is what I’m doing right now, defining my voice, realizing which is the way on which I’m going to share it so that it sticks. I haven’t been able to realize it yet, but I’m moving towards that. I don’t want to be that serious guy that takes everything by heart, but I’m working my way through it. It is always hard for me to define who I am, because it is always evolving. I’m a chameleon, and Twitter gives me the opportunity to explore that every day in a different way. A cool way of experiencing that chameleon-ness that I have come with is creating a new account every month and growing it from 0 to 8k followers. And sharing what I have learned. And do it with completely different stuff. Learning from all the aspects of what is possible in here by just playing the game. Just trying it out.

I go from one idea to the other one, every day, and it is crazy. My mind is crazy. I was meditating before and all that would come to my mind would be different bios, different ways of sharing who I am and what I do. And that is always coming from my point of reference, from my point of view, from who I am. But I need to have into account what I’m there to do for the other person. How will I help her become who she will become. And a big aspect of that will be related to the breathwork practice that I will start going through with people. With that technique, we will go deep into who that person is, to bring down the barriers and with that, bring about what the person truly is.

And that is how I come back to Social Media as a spiritual practice, because as those barriers come down there is a need for sharing the truth of who you are. And that truth is powerfully shared through these platforms, by just being yourself. A problem that arises though is the identification that can be built with this sharing. When people start caring too much about how other people react. Maybe the best social media of them all would be one on which you wouldn’t have feedback from what happened with your content. One on which every piece of content would be valued the same, and the net worth of the network would be distributed between each and every one of the participants.
This is the world on which time is correlated 1:1 between each person, no matter who the person is. One second that I consume your content is a second of ‘credit’ that I have, and it doesn’t matter whose content it is. It is not attached to a particular person, it is just out there. In that utopical world we could start caring just about the quality of the content, more than the person behind it. On being sincere with it, more than trying to capture that cheap dopamine. But the dopamine thing is the game that we are playing right now, and I have not been able to play it well. I don’t truly understand it.

And this is what I mean with ‘meet them where they are at’. Not because I go and play the dopamine game I will be ‘worse’ than the rest. Nope, not at all. It is the game that we are playing right now, and a big part of my spiritual development is related to be able to accept this as a reality and go into that game so that I can better connect with a bunch of people that will start listening to what I say. This is how a shift is made in how we relate as human beings. This is the game that is needed to be played. That is how I’m going to truly evolve, by learning how to play it, on the terms of what is being played, and grow from there. I need to see this as a business, and play it on the business terms.

Am I serious with this thing? Yes. I truly am. I’m doing my thing, and realizing how much value there is on playing it. Should I take myself out of the equation? Is that truly needed? I can play the game in different realms. I can be jp in one side, and I can have an anon account with which to play the game on the other one. I can do it like that, it doesn’t need to be black or white. How much time do I spend being jp on Twitter? Not that much. It is all about being organized, and realizing what can come from there. One can be my personal account, the other one can be the professional one.

One can be related to my work with the breath, and the other one can be related to my work with meditation. The problem that I have is that I’m too sincere, and it is hard for me to go out of there to start sharing with the world everything that I have accumulated as knowledge. Is it good to be anonymous or should I just share who I am in a clearer way? Define it better, and with that, hold space for my own transformation. I don’t have anything to lose, I’m not in a hurry, things will start happening as they do. It is just a matter of being consistent, and the thing is that I am consistent because I care. I care about sharing my voice, I care about creating systems for stuff to really happen. I’m building this thing with my heart, with everything that I have, because I truly care. How can I categorize myself inside something if I’ve never been able to do it? What is what defines who I am?

I can come back to that Vipassana retreat, on which the first day I was given a piece of paper that asked me the question ‘Who are you?’. That question was running through my mind those 10 days of silence, asking myself who I am all the time. It stills runs. This is who I am, I don’t have a particular answer to the question. I just am. But as soon as I open myself to discover more of the world, and resonate with it, I will better discover who I am by just being sincere. By just being. If I go to twitter and start engaging in conversations with people, just be there with them. Just hold the space for their own transformation. It is not about me. It is never about me. It is about giving and receiving, and now is the time when I open to giving. Each sentence that I’m able to craft is an act of giving, which the other person can receive or not, it depends. It is just part of the game. It is all part of the game, and through this words here I’m learning how to play it. I’m understanding which my role is in this whole game, and the moment on which I realize it better is the moment on which I interact with other people.

When I realize that I have something to offer. That they are being sincere. That they are discovering who they are, the same as I am, and that I don’t need to compare myself to where they are at. Every comparison is attached to an expectation of something to be different, and that is not the way to do. I have realized that each time that someone is going through something that is conducing to them being happy, I’m not truly happy for them. I start blaming myself for not being there. I start pushing me down, and being bad to myself because of that. Making this conscious is one of the deepest works that I’m doing now, because I truly want to be happy for the others. If they celebrate that they got 10k followers, be there for them! Don’t blame yourself for not being there yet.

That is me, trying to be in a place different from the one that I’m at now. It is me comparing myself to who I can become, instead of giving every step that is front of me towards that direction. And the biggest step that I can take is actually being happy for what the other person is sharing, and engaging in that conversation with them. That is the step forward, and as soon as I realize that there is value on it I will start living from that value. I have all my life been living in the future of what can be built, of what can happen, and now is the time on which I embrace everything that has happened and bring everything of what I am into the present moment.

Which are the decisions that you can make NOW that will impact your life towards that vision that you have?

The only moment that you have is now. That is the only one. The only moment on which you can act on reality is right now. This is the most important thing to embrace. There is nothing that you can do in the future that can help you become someone different from who you really are. You can just shift your perception of that, but at the bottom of your being, you will be the same, always. You’ll have more tools and ways of conveying who you are, but that eternal exploration is built every day, in every moment, as you decide to engage in life in a or b way. It is a choice, and now is the moment on which I acknowledge all the work that I have done to bring this present moment awareness to my life. And realize that my work is related to helping other people travel that journey also.

A JOURNEY INTO THE PRESENT MOMENT.

That is a good subtitle for the Transformational Journey. We will travel the depth of the mind in order to go back to where we have always been. Realize the clarity that comes from there. Using the breath, using meditation, and using the tools that will be developer we will be there, Doing The Work. We will always be Doing The Work. It is all about the layers of the onion, that are followed until there is a realization that there is no onion at all, everything was a construct of the mind.

Everything is a construct of the mind, and in the depth of that realization there is a window towards the unknown. I only know that I don’t know. That is what is going on in this ancient wisdom. I only know that every moment is a new exploration into the unknown, of what can be, of what can show itself in this amazing experience called life. I only know that I don’t know, because that is the best way of experiencing life. Always with a beginners mind, trying the best to make as much mistakes as possible so that I can learn from them. That is the game that is being played here, the one of throwing out something and then evaluating what happened with it, feeling how it feels, and with that bodily understanding move forward into a new way of being. Every moment is a window into a new way of being. There doesn’t need to be something more special than what is going on right now.

Right now is perfect. Every piece of information that the world gives you is a mirror into who you are. Everything that happens is a window into who you have been, into who you can be, into who you are. That is the only thing that matters, for you to be who you are.

In that sense, social media is a spiritual endeavor because it points you towards who you truly are, by throwing out the layers of what you are not. Via negative. Getting there by the negative, because who you are can’t be spoken. It can only be acted, and by sharing what you care about, your thoughts and what you do with the world, you start becoming. You start just being. But the important thing there is to be conscious of how these things work, and with that awareness explore yourself because of how you feel. If there is this strong need of checking the thing, and seeing your notifications, and everything, just be a witness of it, and be disciplined, and learn more about yourself by observing how you feel. Who is the one that feels disappointed if no one comments? Who is the one that is feeling alone? Who is the one that doesn’t trust? This inquiry can go on and on, and ask them to yourself until there is nothing left. Explore everything that you care about, go deep into that exploration, and be free of all of what you think you are. Open up space for what you truly are. Not what you think you are.

Thinking is in the realm of mind, and what I’m talking about here is what stays after when the mind is not the means by which reality is experienced. When you open yourself to the possibility of being vulnerable. Of sharing your truth.

What is your own and particular truth? There is someone in the world that can benefit from it. What are you waiting to share it? This is the world on which we live in. This is the future. This is where we are going towards. This is what is going to be created. With your effort, with mine, and with the one of every one of us. We are all in this together, and the fact that Twitter is the platform on which we share written text makes it very powerful.

I’m very excited about my participation in there. It has been the biggest spiritual window to the world that I have had, and it feels great. It shows me a lot. I can see the arch of what I have been doing, of what I have shared, of what I care about, and it is quite cool. Learning to grow with the people that resonate. Finding that resonance with people, which has been lost for me before. I have had places on which I have resonated with people, but this is something completely new. This is a new exploration, a new experience, and I love it. I’m curious, excited and willing to learn.

A journey into the present moment with a featured artist. Holy shit, that is powerful. Having a particular person help us create what we want to create, and make our way through it with their help. That is the thing with Dukkha. It doesn’t matter which kind of creative endeavor we are up to. It truly doesn’t matter, because who we are can be expressed through any of them. It only matters that we tap into that capacity of being genuine and build from there. Trusting on what will come. There will be people that will want to dive into this, and my mission is just to trust in what will happen with them. Open up the opportunity for this thing to happen.

There will be the ones that listen. And I’m the first one that listen to what comes out of my mouth. I’m there one that will be there to experience the awe, to experience what is brought to me every time that I read the words that are typed by this fingers.

I only know that I don’t know, and that is because I don’t have any clue about what will be brough up by me in the next moment. And by sharing that voice to the world, I open up to be seen. By myself. By realizing what was brought into my experience. And being a witness of it. Not feel identified by it, but just be a witness of how the conditioned mind feels identified with the consequences of what is brought up by the actions that are undertaken.

Who is the one that feels anxious?
Who is the one that feels imposter syndrome?
Who is the one that doesn’t feel worthy of attention?

Ask yourself that question, deeply, each time that you click the publish button, until there is no one left. Until what is left is only the truth of who you are. Pure creativity, pure energy moving towards a deeper connection with what you have always been.

Every interaction with another human being is a window into a deeper understanding of who you are. Social media is the biggest window that we have ever had to this. Learn how to use it in your benefit, and no one will stop you. Be open to be transformed. Be open to become. All what you have ever been, but that you have not been able to realize yet. Throw away the mask, and check what is left there afterwards.

Who are you when there is no you anymore?
