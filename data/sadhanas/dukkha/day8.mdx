Today I’ll start talking about holding space, and the learnings that come as a consequence of doing that. Yesterday I had a huge one. I organized an event and very few people showed up, which had me very disappointed throughout the whole event because I felt that I had a responsibility with the person that I invited to be the co-host, and the main responsibility that I felt had with her was an economic one. I thought that because of there being very few people, she would get little money, and her time would not be worth it. And there was also the presence of being a failure in the way that I shared what I was going to do, since I was not able to reach out to people properly through social media. But the persons that participated were amazing, they are the most important people for me in the world, and it was very important to share that vulnerable space with them. My wife and the best friend that I have in the world were there. But yes, my capacity for holding the space was compromised because of me having been thrown out of balance for what I felt in that moment. So I was just feeling those sensations and what was brought up for me, through the whole experience. It was important.

And then I went to my parents house, and because of a question that my father made to me (‘How many people were there?’) I realized that I have a strong subconscious pattern of thought that is related to the amount of people participating in something equalling how good it is. The more, the better. This has been present throughout my life, as I have had a very large group of friends, have gone to travels with a lot of people, always more and more and more. Thinking that more is the key. I sit down to work and I think that the more hours I put in the better, not realizing that there is a subtle aspect that is working that is way beyond this number. Last night I had a conversation with only one friend and it was very important, very profound, very nice. This is what matters, having this type of interaction. It doesn’t matter with how many people. But it was there, working its way, and yesterday I was able to spot it right on. It was absolutely freeing to be the witness of that process, of that unconscious process. That is what all this game is about, of making the unconscious aspects conscious. And that was a big one. I was able to realize that and become free of it. I don’t mean that it won’t be active and I won’t value my life based on numbers anymore, but at least it is not as present as it was before. And I want to hold space. I want to be there for others. And if I’m there holding the space being disappointed because no more people showed up, I won’t be able to do it fully, with all of what I am. And I want to be able to do it fully. So that’s why it is so important to have realized this, because it will happen again. There will be another time on which I will organize stuff and people will not show up. It has happened, and it will happen.

And in that moment, what will I decide? To give my best for those who are there, or to blame myself for not having more people in?
The answer is clear as water today. And that is what showing up is for. I created this space, I organized something new, that didn’t exist before, and I showed up for it. I did it because I care. And life answered back with one of the most important realizations that I have had lately, because this is one that constitutes the way on which I work as a human being in society. There is the important concept of traction, and it is impossible to be hosting an event for 100 people from scratch. It is not necessary. What is necessary is to forget about the number, and make it a memorable experience for all of those who are there. For all of those that did show up. My time, their time, is so valuable that it is not worth it to spend it thinking about what could have happened if more people showed up. No, no, no. It is absolutely worth spending with the people that are there, giving their best, pushing it through.

It is more than ever with this type of work, which requires a compromise from the people that participate. It is not easy. It is not free. You have to Do The Work. And people don’t like to be challenged, not too much. It is tough. So this thing will happen again, and it is going to be very important to be able to realize how the ego is playing his thing, how it is working in those subtle ways so that I can become present with what is in that moment. That is the energy that needs to be moving, and that is the work that I’m going to do as I move towards the understanding of how to truly hold space for the transformation of others. I need to open up to do more things like this. I need to be there for more people as they transition into a new way of being. And it starts here. It starts in every session that I go through, in every moment that I decide to show up for other people. There is a strong need inside me of what it means to hold space, and to take that absolutely seriously, having in mind all the aspects of what it can be. It is not a trivial thing, it is not something that should be taken for granted, and it is important. And the only way to learn how to do it better is just by doing it. Is just by showing up. It is just by creating this stuff and making it happen that life will give this treasures to my journey of discovery of who and what I am.

Because this way of behaving constitutes me. It is a huge part of me. It is time to integrate it and move forward without it. Because the festival that will be hosted in February as the launching event for the DAO will be the same. It doesn’t matter how many people show up. What matters is the energy of it, and what will happen there. And I’m in charge of that. It will be a retreat of deep work and deep rest. It will be a retreat on which we will transform our beings through the power of sharing with each other, with nature, and with all of what we are. And the only way to do it wholeheartedly is to forget about the caring of how many people will show up. And this is only achieved if there is a true disconnection between the event itself and the capacity of learning money because of how many people show up. That whole thing needs to be disconnected, so that there is no problem in any way if 10 people show up, or 200. What needs to happen is that people have to bring their own stuff, and it has to be everything self-sustaining. Like burning man. Everyone brings their own stuff, we just gather there and see what happens from the experience. But there is not a central authority that is deciding what will happen. I’m just in charge of the music, of finding people that are willing to play their music, or if not, I’m in charge of creating the playlist that will be running if there is no people that is willing to play their music. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters more than the opportunity to gather to celebrate what is being built through the writing of this document. This is all what is. This is the important part. Because the movement that is starting now is powerful, it will have an impact, and is the energy that is moving through me. I have to be fit for service. I have to be strong. I have to be the best version of myself, and that is not a static thing. It is the consequence of being able to show up, and use every opportunity that life gives me to realize better which are my biases, and who am I really. What do I really bring into the world. The only way to explore those questions is to come out of my comfort zone, and explore them in the wilderness. Out there in the wild. Where people are good, and also bad. Shield myself from what is not helpful, and become in the process. Use every interaction that life offers a tool for deeper exploration, for deeper playing of this game. Learn to recognize the signals. Be there for them and show up. Just show up. That is all that matters. The learning comes from there, and it is more subtle than what I think. The unconscious mind is working on the background, there is no need for me to control that process. But I need to show up, in order to have it up and running.

That is what this whole game of evolution is about. It is about interacting with the world, getting feedback, and learning how to play the game better. It is giving and taking. It is helping and being helped. On Wednesday I will start a huge adventure in that sense, and I will give my best to stay focused and realize that I have everything that is needed to provide my family with all of what they need. To be free from the burden of dependence from my family in economic terms. And more than that, to have people to believe in what I do, and help them become who they can be. That is my mission here, to shine a light into other people so that they can be the best version of themselves. That is all that matters, and I’m here for that.
