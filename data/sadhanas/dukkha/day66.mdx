What is it about myself that craves for this complexity to be present in my life? What is the aspect of myself that wants to bring more and more of that complexity into what I do? How is that manifested in the world, and how does that impact my whole experience of reality?

Part of why it is so hard for me to focus into the direction that I want to move is this constant desire of wanting to do something different from what I’m doing. It is like a ghost that is on the back of my head, always making that noise, always thinking about the 10th step down the road, instead of the first one. What if I just started becoming more and more interested on the one that lies right in front of me, and I acted from there? How would that look like?

But this is me, complaining to myself, because of the stuff that I’m bringing. Today I applied to 2 different programs, with different ideas, and I seem to be all over the place. But is it truly that I’m like that or I’m just exploring how it feels to just play? I just want to play, I just want to explore how the world looks like when you live it from that perspective, and that is the permission that life has given me right now. And it keeps giving it to me. There are more and more signals that the next steps to be taken are those of play, joy, and exploration of what it brings to me to just be myself. To share myself. To enjoy myself. Those are all aspects of what I bring into the table, right here, right now, and I’m just exploring how all of that feels. How it feels to expose myself to the world, at least for me to be seen, to be witnessed. The world is watching, and each act that I do in it is a new exploration into the realms of action that come from being open to what it brings. That is the game that I’m playing, and that is what I’m bringing as I apply to stuff, as I show myself, as I educate myself more, so that I can educate more.

I’m an eternal student of life, and it is by having that perspective that I’ve gotten to where I am right now. I have a particular set of skills, of knowledge, of understanding, that I need to bring into the world in a way that is conducing to something cool. And all those feelings of anxiety that may arise because I have not done enough yet are only that, noise. But a necessary noise, so that I can listen to myself and realize more and more what is it that I bring into the table. What is it that I’m bringing into the world through my own actions. The consequence of what I do is who I am. The consequence of my being is what I bring into the world. And I explore it from there. It is quite a cool journey.

What if I express gratitude for the life that I’m living, and the world in which I’m living? I was able to apply for this two programs and that means that I will have eyes in my words. Someone will be reading what I wrote, and that means a lot, because it is a window into what is possible right now. I live in a moment of history without comparison in the past, I mean, no moment can be truly compared to another one, but the one that I’m living at right now is quite special because of all that. Because of the fact that I can interact with people from all over the world and learn more about myself and my intentions and what I want to bring into the world in that process is huge. By filling these applications, I was forced to think about what I have done, and frame it in a way that can be conducing for other people to understand it. To maybe find value in it, the value that I have not been able to see. That is the thing, all this time I have thought about myself as someone that is not cool enough, that doesn’t have enough good ideas, and it is time for me to take that hat off and realize that I have something to offer, that is waiting to be brought into the world, and that is waiting to be unleashed. I’m becoming more and more aware of this, and it is time for me to embody every aspect of who I am so that I can realize that the value that I bring into the world is something that these venture capitalists are waiting for. That is what VC is about. Investing in the people, more than the idea, because they believe that there is something there that will eventually transform their life.

Eventually, money ends up being the means for channeling this information, but it is just that. Cool people want to surround themselves with cool people, and with the help of funding others they can do this. That’s the thing, that’s the game, and I’m learning to play it by opening the doors of being willing to be funded. For someone to trust in me, in my ideas, in what I bring into the world, and because of that, thrive. I’m here thriving because I believe in myself, and all the noise that can be built in my experience because what I have not done in the past is just that, noise. Why not see that as the biggest asset that I have? I have been away from the whole thing for all my life. I don’t know how it works, so basically, I don’t care about how it works. I will just find my way through it with passion, with courage, and with the understanding that comes from following your inner compass. That’s the game that I’m going to play. That’s what I bring into the world, and it is so easy for me to forget that, but it is important that I don’t. It is very important for me to realize that I have something to add to this place, and that which I will add is the value of how every life experience that I’ve gone through has evolved my relationship with myself. That is the game that I’m playing here. That is what I’m learning to do. And why would I dissociate myself and do something here and something there if I can just bring more and more of who I am into what I do? But what is that what I do? What do I need to separate? Why in this act of wanting to integrate I end up separating?

I just want to integrate everything I am and have been into the expression of my work, into the creations that I bring into the table, and with that, fully express my truth. My truth is the one that is brought up with the healing that arises from facing the own demons. I am the one that is here to help you face your own demons. I am the one that is here to push you to your limits, so that you can, from there, bring whatever you need to bring into your experience of life. So that you can truly live with your consciousness anchored in the experience of now. Of this moment. The only one that you will ever have. And yes, I jumped from one place to the next one and it is perfect like that because that is what I’m bringing to the world right now. That noise is what I am, and it is time for me to embrace it and be ok with it. It is time for me to realize that I am my own creation, and that each manifestation of what is being brought to life through me is more of that. I’m allowing myself to just be, to just explore, and in that exploration there is more and more value. This whole book is part of that exploration, part of the understanding that I need to bring into my life related to where I’m moving towards. What is it that I’m doing? What is it that I’m going to bring into the world? This is being intentional 101, and I’m pushing it to the limit. Such is the intentionality that I’m bringing into what I do that I’m writing this whole book to do that. This is how much I care about what I do. This is how much I care about the sharpening of my interface with reality so that I can experience it fully. Bring every aspect of myself into each thing I do. That is the magic. That is the power. That is what I bring. That is what I’m doing here. Just exploring the limits of life from the lens of there no being limits. And I don’t have any problem telling the world that I need help. I need to be next to those that want to help me so that I can become the best version of myself. So that I can build it, day after day, with humility and consistency.

Had to go back to the application and send it again, with the new information that is being brought out of what I’m writing here. I really need to shout to the world how much I care about it. How much I’m willing to give up for it. For becoming the best version of myself, so that I can be more and more of it. More and more of who I already am. I’m just exploring how it feels right now, just sitting with what is. Experimenting with what is.

I’ve sent the application like 6 times, and it is amazing like that. I love it. I’m just exploring what comes, and witnessing how it feels to expose myself. To be in service by just exposing myself, my ideas, and what I bring.
