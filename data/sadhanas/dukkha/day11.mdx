Day 11, 06 October 2022
The perpetual seeker. Those are the words that came as a description of who I have been. Diving into all the experiences that I have found in order to ‘heal’, so that eventually I can become more anchored in the present. In presence. That is the main goal that has been revealed throughout this whole journey, of pure, uninterrupted presence. I have tried to be intelligent my whole life, and that is the ultimate intelligence. I have tried to enjoy my whole life, and the key is to stop trying and just enjoy. I have tried to express myself throughout my whole life, and the clearest way to do it, the most pure and sincere, is to just share who I am from that which arises from presence. From being presence.

Yesterday I had an important experienced, on which I shared something with a group of people and then spent quite a bunch of time digesting what had been shared, because it didn’t feel real, it didn’t resonate with my voice. So then I went back and shared from a place of more clarity, of more presence, and what came out of it was just poetry. It was one of those pieces to which I come back moment after moment to just read it again. Obviously there is an aspect to be a witness to the reaction that people had to it, but it was not the main thing. The main thing was to realize that that is my voice. That is who I am when the boundaries of the mind are not in the middle, and when there are no boundaries at all. That is who I want to be, because it is a pure expression of who I am. Writing helps me express who I am through words, and there are times on which they just flow out and there is no interruption from the mind on that process. There seems to be a direct pathway between my Self and what is being written. Sometimes the mind gets in between, but when it doesn’t, it feels great. It feels sincere. And I know that people get that, I have gotten a lot of feedback related to it. All what I’m doing with these words here is to explore a little bit deeper into what comes when I let that flow free. I don’t seem to have a clear direction, I’m not sure about what I’m doing here, but it feels like the right thing to do. There is a constant pressure on the top of my shoulders related to making money and bringing that material comfort to my family, but there really isn’t clarity on how to do that. I feel completely lost in that realm. And I need help. I really need help. And who will know that I need help if I don’t raise my hand and ask for it?

It is time to go for that, and everything that I will write down here is an exploration into that.

What do I want to accomplish?

I want to transform all the spiritual growth that I have gone through into material growth, by healing the relationship that I have with money and with myself in the process. There is always imposter syndrome present, which won’t let me progress in a way that is professional. Everything I do lacks a component of quality because I’m all over the place. I jump from here to there, and that is always bringing me down because there is no consistency, there is no truth in the sense that what I bring into the world is disalligned with what I have inside, because there is always a rush into doing stuff. There is not this aspect of polishing, of sanding, of putting consciousness into what I do.

All those things are coming from the negative, from bringing about the bad things, what is missing. What is lacking. Why don’t better bring up the positive? I have done a lot of personal work, which has led me to be very responsible for myself. I have a strong voice and a lot of things to say, and I want to be able to create something with which I can help people walk that same road. I have been paving the road for people to walk it with less effort, with less struggle, because I know that not all of people have the same drive and passion that I have. And it doesn’t need to be like that, we are all different, but I want to be able to help other people walk that road of self discovery. Of understanding who they are, where their thoughts are coming from, so that they can be not identified by them. I know that the consequence of this is a cleaner expression of creativity, and I want to help people tap into their creative potential. I want to find the ones that want to walk the road that I have paved with my experience, and I want to clarify what that road looks like by realizing it with these people. I want to refine my message so that it can better resonate with that people. I want to learn how to polish, sand and clarify what I write so that it has a bigger impact in the people that will read. I want to build a system for my writing, so that I can focus completely in the person that will read it.

There has been people that have benefited enormously from what I have written, and I want to find those so that I can make an impact in their life. I want to reach out, communicate and enjoy life from there. I want to learn who I am by interacting with people. The concept networking has always made noise in my head, because I have always looked at it from an utilitaristic sense. It was always a means to an end, talking to people because I want to make business with them. But I was lacking in that realization was the transformative aspect of business. We make business because it is the way on which we bring who we are into the world, and if I’m able to tap into that and realize that it is very helpful for those who are involved, I will walk towards becoming free of this money issue if I’m able to realize that money is the means by which we exchange information in society, about preferences, about who we want to be. I want to build a system around myself that cares about that. That cares about the movement of energy that is produced by people spending their life force in something who they want to become. There is the sentence in my mind going on: People like us do things like this. That is the thing. People like us spend money on things like this. On what have I spent the most money in the last years of my life? Self improvement. There is no end to it, it is addictive, and I don’t think I’ll stop because there is so much to learn, and so many people to learn from. It is a spiral, and the people that I have met in that spiral are the people with which I want to share my life. It is easy for me to forget about it and feel that I’m alone, think that I’m alone, but it is not like that. I’m not alone. There is a lot of people that care about me, that care about what I do, and if I’m not able to realize that fact I won’t get anywhere. I can list all the adventures that come to my mind related to self improvement, and think about all the people that were in those experiences:

- Universo Paralello
- Permaculture course in el manzano
- Vipassana
- Traveling around the world to discover myself
- Yoga teacher training course
- Innovation Masters
- Creatives Workshop, and all the akimbo ones
- altMBA
- Gathering for the families
- IAM retreat, samadhi center
- Breathwork therapy with Rocio
- Breathwork training with Rocio

All of these experiences are deep inside me, and define who I am. The people that are part of those experiences are the ones that care about me, and the ones that know me in the deepest level. A lot of the people inside those places know me, and care about me. Probably they would be delighter to hear my voice, to read it, and realize who I have become. If I’m not sharing it with them, if I’m still hiding, I won’t be able to walk towards where I have to walk. It is time for me to realize where my strength is, and it is related to being able to see other people. To care about them. My strengths are always related to the relationship that I can build with other people, because I’m very good at that. I’m very good at realizing what someone needs, and pointing that person towards that so that there can be some kind of resolution.

What I want to accomplish is to have a group of people that care about what I write, and to develop a relationship with them that makes me feel alive. I want to go out of my hiding, and share who I am with the world. I want to help people, and be able to value that help so that I can live from that. So that I can provide my family. I want to build a tribe around what I’m spreading into the world, which is a constant willingness to get the most out of life. To live experiences as deeply as I can, and learn from there. I love going into courses, learning about different stuff, and it is time for me to embrace that and create from there. Become a creator of the world that I want to live in by sharing with people the importance of constant evolution. It is not about a particular subject, a particular thing that you do. It is not about going into A or B course, workshop, or whatever. It is about having learners mindset all the time, and this is the moment on which I realize that. It is the moment on which I discover that what I came to do here is to learn from other people, and explore who I am in that whole process. I will be a node in the eternal seeking of knowledge, of inspiration, of growth. I will be the one that builds the course that other people will come in and be very very very inspired by. I will be the connector, the one that builds stuff. The builder. I’m jp, the builder of experiences. For example, in this cohort, each of us is paying 500 bucks to learn more about twitter in community. There will be a point on which all of us will be the eternal learner, and that is the mindset that I want to bring into the world. Not one of awakening particularly, not one of A or B, just one of beginners mindset. Of realizing that each thing that you do can be an exploration into who you can become, by facing the challenge of learning something now.

There may be some people for which it is hard to come in a place and be alone in there, without anyone that they know from before, but I’m way past that. I don’t care about it. I just show up, with everything that I am. And I guess that that is a reason because of which people don’t show up in online stuff, because they prefer going to a place that they know since before. It is not an easy thing to show up in front of people that you don’t know, but because of that they are losing a lot. It is very important to face that fear, and just show up. Be a witness of everything that comes up after that experience. Always being a witness of how you react to different circumstances, and if those circumstances are varied, it will be very cool.

I don’t think I’ll have a specific audience, because what I care about changes every day. I can’t help it. I just roll with it. Should I focus more? I don’t think I could. It is a huge part of the way on which I relate to life to be jumping from one thing to the next one. I just can’t help it. It is all part of who I am. So probably I will end up crafting journeys for people to dive in and enjoy, the same as the one that I just started, Create, Publish, Profit. In it, they have gathered a bunch of creators that teach you how to become like them, each of them giving their example, each of them showing how they have walked the road. In this case that road is the one of Twitter, they share who they have become in Twitter. But what if in my case I share that road in life? Who is the person that I have become because of everything that I have done? How can I enroll people into that journey so that they can be transformed by just experiencing it? That is the journey that I’m in, the one of discovering the answer of how I share myself with the world so that I can have a better grasp to what brings value to them. What is the value that I bring into the world? How can I share more of that?

Isn’t the answer clear? By just sharing myself. By just being who I am. With that, I can eliminate all the friction that is in the middle of who I should be, of who I could be. I am just who I am in that moment, and that is all that matters so that the impact can be made. From myself to the outside. Bringing to the world what I care about. I spend so much time creating a ‘breathwork persona’ on the internet and it doesn’t even matter, because the amount of people that I will work with in that realm is much less than what will eventually follow what I do. I just need to refine my message so that I understand how to share it more clearly. That is the game. It is not about building personas around a particular thing, it is just about sharing my voice in the clearest way I can, and that is by writing. I know that my thing is writing. I know that I become who I am by writing, and I know that I care about people that write and read. I don’t feel comfortable around those that are not able to pick up a book and read it, because there is something that is missing from that interaction for me. It is the wonder, the willingness to grow, the willingness to become a different version. And that willingness opens up when you have the courage to open a book, or an article, or whatever written piece, and be open to change because of it. That is the people that I want to relate to, and if I don’t write I will never be able to tap into those communities. I just need to show up and share my thoughts, letting the mind not filter them with its noise, but letting it become an empty vessel from which stuff can arise.

Being creative means to let arise the genius from within. Opening up space for that to happen. If I’m always trying to control, always trying to find the way out, I’ll never make it. There will always be that noise running on the background telling me that I could be doing things differently. In meditation, we free up space for the self to shine through the noise. That process can be related to the one of creativity arising, on which I free up the space for me to be who I am, through my creative act. I open up that space and I set it free. I let it be. That’s all that matters, the set and setting so that it can shine through. And that is what all the work I have done is about, creating the means for that to happen. The most important spiritual act is done in every moment, as you get up from the cushion and live life from the understanding of what was brought up during the practice: that all there is is change.

That’s all what the practice is about. It is creating conditions for better understanding of the underlying principles of how you interact with the world. It is about the eternal discovery of who you are, in every moment. That’s what Socrates meant with ‘all I know is that I don’t know’. There is absolute zero certainty about how life will look like in a moment different from the present, and that is the game that you have to learn to play. Everything that truly is is what you are experiencing now. It’s all that you’ll ever have. That is the beauty of it, because there hasn’t been a moment different than the present in all the history of humanity. Each human that has ever been alive has had the window into the wonders of life in each moment, no matter what was going on in his surroundings. That’s why it is the highest form of intelligence, because it is not related to who you have been, or what you actually know. It is about how able you are to make decisions based on what is going on in front of you, right now. It is about realizing that every reality is built from what happens in this moment, and I want to be able to share that with the world.

I want to dive deep into everything that is going in the internet, and realize that there can be enormous wealth that can come from there. Not because of a specific end, but because it is a window into presence. Into exploring who we are by going out of our confort zone. I want to be an example of that. I want to throw myself into the void constantly, just by experiencing what it looks like to have someone fully engaged in what is going on in there. The future of us looks like cohorts around stuff, and the important thing is to realize than in each and every one of them there is value, because each of those are unique with the people that are in there. When you have a particular mixture of people, no matter who they are, there will always be growing in there. I can go into a pottery class and give my best in it, and there will always be something that I will learn that will transform who I am in the process and help me progress towards that deeper understanding. It is about lowering the barriers, and letting yourself just be by throwing you into the void. That is the important thing, throwing yourself into the void. Creating stuff. It is about having the coolest creators in the world, and being able to be right there, next to them, Doing The Work. Evolving together by showing up to the craft.

A great idea is unravelling as I go through this rant, because it is an amazing concept. Grab a great product designer, and put him into a cohort of people that for 21 days Do The Work 4 hours every day. They have to show up and create. And they are all perfecting the craft, and becoming more of what they can be just by doing the thing. It doesn’t matter what it is, the person will know, but it will be an important thing because of what will show up in the process. Musicians, artists, whoever you want. It is just about showing up to do the work. No more learning on a vacuum, just show up and work alongside each of the persons that are in there. And if you have any questions, just share them with the people. Someone will know the answer. Or you can work your way through. This is the perfect antidote for procrastination, because it is about showing up, each day, to become who you want to become. Do put in the repetitions. To share. To share who you are, and where you are at. It is not about comparing A to B and realizing that one is better and the other one is not, that doesn’t work anymore. It is about lighting that spark that can make you shine for your own accounts, it doesn’t matter who is next to you. You have a specific combination of knowledge, expertise and life experience that is deeply embedded in your unconscious, and if you are able to realize that the highest form on which you can create from there is to erase your mind from the process and just Do The Work, you will thrive. This is where all your being comes into form, when you are able to create from a place of trust. Of openness. Of just showing up. Each person in the world is in a different level, each person in the world has something different to offer. Just show up, and give your best. Only you know what your best looks like.

What are my dreams and aspirations?

I want to become more of myself. I want to make peace with the noise in my head and truly internalize how helpful it has been throughout my life, but move on from there. I want to be able to be part of cohorts all my life, and be learning every day something new. I want to be able to convey what I have learned in a way that makes sense for those who will listen, and I want to help people realize that taking chances and risks is the way forward into a life of presence. I want to help people to realize that they already have everything that they need, because everything that they need is their presence. It is all of what they have. I aspire to be able to accept me for who I am, and accept people that surround me. I aspire to be able to embrace the fact that my parents have done their best, in spite of what I can think that they did wrong. I want to have a voice that is heard, and aligned with the deepest core of my being. I want to have a consistent practice that lets me live from that, and give love to my daughter in the process. I want to have time to teach her the beauty of life, and not be trapped in the system. I want to teach myself in a different way from what I was taught, so that I can help build a new way of education.

What are my biggest fears?

Asking for help, and realizing that I’m not enough. The biggest fear that I’m facing right now is the dissolution of who I think I am. It is the discovery of what I truly am, and there is no fear as the one that I have experienced when I sit down and meditate. It is an animal thing. Another fear that comes to my mind is my father dying and I not been able to be there with him without complaining for everything that he does. I fear not to free myself from that burden before he dies. I fear that I can’t be the child that he needs before he dies. But what is that? I’m just what I am, and that is everything that he needs. Probably he doesn’t have all these thoughts in his mind, for him, I am just who I am. It is me the one that wants to change his relationship with him, so that I can appreciate more everything that he has done. But I’m appreciating it. I and doing my work. I am here helping as much as I can given the circumstances that I have been giving in my life. I am, truly, giving my best. A big fear is not being able to make it and having to get a 9-5 job.

What obstacles am I facing?

Lack of clarity. There is always too much noise in my mind related to not doing the correct thing. The last year I spent it learning how to code to then realize that I did not want to do that as a proper job, and there is a huge feeling inside me that I wasted a lot of time that I could have spent writing, or doing something different. A big obstacle is that it is never enough for me. I’m looking for something else all the time, and this takes energy from my missions because those missions change very often. I have a strong feeling that I have been iterating and moving closer towards something, but when is it really going to end?

A huge obstacle is that I don’t have a source of income right now. This brings a lot of pressure into what I do, because I need to start earning money so that I can provide to my family and live with that. I don’t need to much, so it is kind of ridiculous to be in this position, but it is what it is. I don’t truly know what to do to earn money from the position that I am and continue to do what I want to do, but I know that I have to start somewhere. A big obstacle is the noise in my head that tells me that I could be doing something different, more productive.

What problem do I solve? The suffering. The identification with the suffering that people go through in life, and that is a consequence of not being clear about what they want. Not be willing to take risks and build the life that they can be proud of. The identification with their thoughts. You are not your thoughts, you are way beyond that, and you spend most of your time thinking about them.

I help them connect with their self so that their true creative work can come out of there.

What will they achieve? Clarity in the way that they relate to themselves, and because of that, with their surroundings.

What can I promise them? My presence and holding space for their transformation. I don’t have the answers, I can’t have them, they are just inside them.

—

I want to be there for people and help them become who they can become.
