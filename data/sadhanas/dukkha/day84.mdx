There is a little void inside, the one that is built up when facing the end of something that has been important for you. All this writing has brought to me insights that I will carry the whole of my life, and more than that, it has been a place where I can come and feel heard. No one is listening, no one is reading, but I feel heard. As if the world knows the work that I’ve done. I truly don’t need anyone to come and read what I have written because the important part of it is not that, it is that it has happened. A few days ago I entered again a bookstore and saw the thousands of books that piled on top of each other in all those shelves. If I want this book to help me make a living, I need to bring it on top of each of those ones, and make people buy it. That is never going to happen, at least I don’t expect it to happen. And there is a certain kind of freedom associated with that, with the inexistent necessity to be showcased in some way. I just needed to get this out of myself, and I still need to do it, every day. I need to come here and just share with myself what is happening inside, and writing is the best that I have found for that process. This feels like having a conversation with God.

Yesterday I had a very nice interaction with an old man in the streets as I went out to have a walk with my little girl. He spoke to me about gratitude, and about how he each day ended up the day praying to god and expressing gratitude to him because of the day that just had gone by. Because of the people that were part of it. Because of the conversations. Because of it being how it was. This connects very importantly with another thing that I heard in the afternoon about gratitude, a guy having that as the biggest lesson that Ayahuasca has told him. Be grateful for what you have. Be mindful and grateful for what you have. That is something that is so difficult for me. I find it very hard to realize the things that I have present in my life, and this happens with my parents, with my partner, with my little girl, with my grandmother, with everyone. It is just so much easy to take ewverything for granted. To not witness the value of everything that is around, and just critizice and find ways of making it better. That’s me, always. Not realizing what I have in front, and just looking for ways to make it better.

Right now, as I write, I have my eyes closed. There is a lot of energy flowing through my body, especially from the area of the head downwards. It is quite amazing. On the back of my right eye there is a slight pressure that is being dissolved, and the consequences of that dissolution are a sensation of energy flowing. Similar than the one when you get goosebumps. It’s amazing. I don’t have a clue about what is going on inside me, but I know that I just trust. I cannot do anything else than trusting. Could I go to the neurologist? What could I say to him? “Yes, you know, I have been intensely rewiring my whole nervous system so that I can experience life not from the biases that have been built in my interface with reality because of my life experience but actually by the truth of what is happening, right here, right now. I have walked towards dissolving the boundaries of my sense of “I” and my third eye is opening. But everything is ok, I trust”. What would he say to me? I mean, I’m just imposing words and ways of being in someone based on the experience that I have had with other doctors, which may not be safe, but that is the overall judgements that I have of doctors. I don’t trust them enough. Yesterday we were passing by a hospital an a doctor passed by that was very, very fat. How can I trust someone that preaches health if he is the biggest expression of an unhealthy body? I don’t trust the whole human condition related to health now. I think we, as a collective, don’t understand what health is. It is not something that is present in the pool of collective preoccupations enough, because all of our society is focused on healing diseases. Instead of focusing on living a healthy life and having good habits so that your body can be prepared to deal with these kinds of things. But anyway, that’s part of another thing here.

It has been my experience that when I started going deep into the rabbit hole of deepening the exploration within, the natural consequence of it is taking care more of the body. There is a tendency that comes related to wanting to have the vessel in good shape, so that you can get the most out of this amazing experience called life. If you take care of it, the probability that you will live for a longer time is much bigger, and also the quality of this living is greatly enhanced. I cannot imagine how it feels to be carrying more than 40 kilograms extra of what is healthy for you. It must be very painful. But it is part of this collective problem that we have, and part of what I’m doing here is building the trust inside people that is needed so that they can trust themselves in the quest for answers. Right now, people don’t trust in themselves enough, and the consequence of this is that they look for the opinion of a third party (most of the times a doctor) to give them the advice they need. And this is interesting related to the whole topic of this manifesto, because in many cases the teacher can be some sort of a spiritual doctor. The one that gives you the lead so that you can walk towards somewhere. But what if we developed the capacity for trusting enough in what we have inside? Where would that take us? It’s all part of the same game that I’m talking about in this book. Finding the means for trusting enough in yourself will have as a consequence the fact that you will care about you in a different way. In every sense. Everything that you bring into each one of your holes end up having a consequence in the way on which you experience life, and if you are a bit more aware of this, you end up caring about it in a different way. You end up opening the door for it to be different, day after day.

This book is about developing the means for building an answer to depression and addiction. I feel that addiction is kind of a consequence of depression (I’m no expert at all, that’s just how I feel about it), so the root of all these things can be traced back to depression. To that existential feeling of nothing ever being enough. That fundamental misalignment with reality, which is expressed in the individual in many different ways. What I’m building in here is a system to which people will be able to head to if they are in this state of overwhelming. And in that sense, it is very important what I build is scalable, so that more and more people can make sense of it. Use of it. So that as many people as they want can come here and take a short step towards feeling better. At the end of the day, that is what we all want, isn’t it? TO feel a bit bette r,a bit more connected, a bit more of ourselves. The cosmic surgery is still going on in my brain, now I had like a shock of electricity going around in the right area. It is incredible what is happening. I could be worried, for example if I had taken some drink and I would be having this I would be much more scared, but now I realized that it is not going to work like that, this is going just to happen if I’m able to deal with it in a way that makes me feel aligned with my own and particular truth. Right now, I came to raul and asked him if he… You know, I have been this last 2 minutes with the eyes closed and there is a slight sleepiness in me and I start writing and then I forget what I was writing about so I go everywhere all at once. And it ends up being confusing, and here I am, not knowing if to go or not. What a critical thing , just today. The thing is that the bus is too big, the bus that is coming to my in my daydreams, right now, as I just write whatever comes to mind. There was an image of a yellow bus that came to mind, and now with that one came the film “Into the wild”, with which I felt really represented when I was younger. This brings me to what happened yesterday, that is that I found papers of the time on which I went to study my masters problem, on which I realized that the interpretation that we build of ourselves and others is what constitutes reality. If I’m able to expose myself in a particular way to you, you are going to frame the understanding that you have of myself in that way, and that will end up determining the quality of the interaction that we will have. I know that most of what I wrote in this paragraph doesn’t make any sense, but it is just part of what is. I love doing this kind of thing, closing my eyes and just letting the thing come out, whatever it is. It is one of the big things of not having to go to work. When I do it I enter a kind of sleepy state that ends up bringing stuff that afterwards I don’t remember, and it is very interesting to experience what that stuff is about. What comes up. The unconscious being released through the words that I’m saying.

That is one of the things that I also had inside yesterday as I was listening to a very interesting podcast, on which the guy spoke about a moment on his life when he discovered that he was bulimic. A part of the conversation was about that, and about how he did not have support, and afterwards they talked about him not having shared it with the world before, and how it felt to do it. He felt a big sense of relief by opening it up, and what came to me was that big burden that I have had on the top of my shoulders related to being gay. There is a very big pressure in the society on which I have grown to have a straight sexuality, and that has been very harmful for me because there is always this tendency inside me that tells me ‘I need to be straight’. So any time there was a situation in my life on which I doubted my sexuality, there would be a strong feeling inside of letting someone down, or being wrong. As if it was wrong. But that is what I was told by society my whole life, so those wounds are there, somewhere. There is always that ‘fear of being gay’, which would bring down a lot of people, which would let down everyone that I know. The whole image that I have built of myself in life is actually related to this, looking for woman so that I can sleep with her and ‘be less gay’ in the eyes of other people. All the shallowness of the way of living that I had in most part of my life was built on this fear of not fitting in my environment, and this is a big way on which that is expressed. That’s something that came with a lot of clarity in the retreat, and it is amazing that it comes right now again. There is an incredible tendency inside me related to being part of something, fitting in a particular place of society. And as I write that, I think about all the things that I have done that are different from the ones that the group that I’m part of do. Do I really want to fit? But in the retreat it came to me with a lot of clarity, that my mind builds stories about the future, it over complexifies life so that it can have a story to tell. And in me, the more complex the story the better it will be received by the other person. And that’s why I end up making everything that I do more and more complex. That’s the way on which I value myself. That’s how I try to fit. By being straight and complex. What an incredible waste of time and energy, all these things for trying to find my place in the world. Have I done it? Not yet. But here I am, exploring one more where that place is. Where do I fit? Will I ever fit? I don’t know, and I truly don’t think so. And it is ok. The truth is that I have always been an outsider, always looking for a new perspective, a new way of interacting with each problem that comes, and exploring what all of those bring. It is just part of what is. It is just part of the experience of being a human being. And it is ok like that. It is just part of what is. I’m here, exploring what it takes to not have that constant and eternal willingness to fit. I’m here to give up the fitting, so that I can just be. The world will accommodate to my being-ness. It will be alright. Everything will be alright. It’s just part of what is. And I like it like that. What I have told here recently is something very important for me, but it is not what defines me. I feel better by saying it, and that’s what matters. It’s part of my truth. I have been a big part of my life scared of being gay. Because of all the consequences that that could have. And it is ok. It is part of the story that I have been told in society related to what happens when you are gay. It is just part of the collective story of having to fit. To be someone specific. What I’m doing here is trying to help people to find the answers that will lead them into a capacity for living in the present moment, enjoying the wonders of what life has to offer.

I have been almost one month living in an apartment in the 8th floor, and I miss being at the floor level really. Now I closed my eyes and felt as if I flying, and it seems that I need grounding because of all what is present in me. Of course I need some grounding. But I still have 10 days here, so I just need to get used to it and try to get the most out of these days. Being here in comparison to being in my house down where I live is a huge difference. I miss the green of the eternal farms and the cows and the trees and the lake and the nice air, and everything. And yesterday we had a king of big argument with my wife and the perspective of splitting came back to us, and now I realize: Do I really want to split? Do I really want my little girl to grow in this city? I mean, there are a lot of amazing people here, you can go down the street and find very cool people walking their dog, but that can happen anywhere. Eventually, there is cool people everywhere, but the fact of living with my daughter and my wife and having that life with them should be an important aspect of the way on which I deal with the problems that we have. It is time to have that in mind when we argue, so that we can start embracing the possibility of the alternative. If we split, we’ll probably have to come back to live in this place, and that is something that I don’t look forward to. I thought I would, because of all the technological advancements and everything that is happening, but now that I think it better it is not something that I want for myself or for my family. I’m tired of being here. I miss my house, my garden, my office. I miss being where I decided to live my life. I miss my parents and my grandmother and my aunt. I miss the little kids of my cousins. I miss my cousins and their family. I miss my routine. Holy shit, I miss my speakers. It has been very intense to be here all this time, because we are here for doing something important for my wife. Most of me being here is because of joining her in stuff that is important for her, and yesterday I realized with clarity that in me there is not this clear perspective of: “If it is good for her, it is good for me”. In that sense, I’m very selfish, and I admit it. I’m doing it for her, and it is hard for me to give up this thought, and not expect some kind of recognition from her. Yesterday in the argument that we had there was a lot of willingness for her to recognize the efforts that I do for her. Just being here, or spending all the time that I spend with them, is a major thing. And in me, it is always me doing it for them. Maybe this is something that needs to change, because I’m placing a burden in their shoulders. It is time to be responsible and conscious of my own experience, and start embodying the fact that what I do I do it for myself.

And I think now: How does this relate to the fact that it is so hard for me to charge for my work? How does this relate to the fact that it is so hard for me to deal with the fact that all the time that I pose the challenge of building something in the world I have the wellbeing of humanity in mind, more than my own? I’m not sure about the relationship of these things, or the role they play, but I know that there is something in there related to my incapacity of establishing proper boundaries. It is very easy for me to give everything that I have, everything that I am, so that I can please others and make them feel good, but which is the moment on which I think of myself? Which is the moment that I give me that present? And I mean, in many ways, I have been doing it. At the end of the day, all the work that I have done is for myself. All the sits in the meditation cushion, all the retreats, all the travels, all the courses. Everything has been in the hope of deepening the relationship that I have with myself, and in that sense, it is just part of who I am. I evolve by doing these kind of things, and it is just part of who I am. And I won’t stop. It’s just the game that I like to play, the game of exploring life, the game of being there looking at new opportunities, looking for new things to do. It is just part of how I play this game, and it has brought me to this place.

Yesterday I was looking back and trying to get an understanding of why I am where I am and I remembered when I asked a friend for a book to read and he told me “Autobiography of a yogi” and then I read it and knew about the kriya yoga technique, which Yogananda brought to the west and then I started practicing that and now that I think about it is another course that I have done. But it was too intense for going through it alone, so I ended up giving it up after 5 months (of 9). But that’s how I work I read about this technique of deepening the relationship with the self, kind of the most advanced spiritual technique, and I had the obvious challenge of going through it. Of learning it. And I was very consistent for those 9 months, it was crazy. And that’s my thing, when I see something that calls my attention I do everything that I can to dive into it as deep as I can so that I can understand it better. And that’s the challenge that I have right now: How can I understand better what I will do in the next months? What will end up happening with this whole program? The thing is that it truly doesn’t matter. What matters is that I build a system that works even for 1 person, and that that system is built around the things that I already do now. It’s just that. It has to be as mutable as it can, and the goal of it needs to be as clear as it can be so that it can attract the right people at the beginning. The rest of it will have much more momentum and -hopefully- people participating. Both in the side of the creation of the experience and in the side of the being part of the activities. The creative work, the meditation, the breathwork, everything that ends up being part of each program. It is very exciting to pose the challenge to look for the most interesting things that exist so that people can wake up. To maybe invent new ways for doing it. What is present in me, always, is the book The Infinite Jest. The film that the book speaks about inside is called the same as the book, and it is one that is so interesting that it ends up being a lethal weapon because if you see it you will die.

And that’s the thing that I keep coming towards. What if the way on which all this people will wake up is through entertainment? What if we are able to develop a system that is so, so, so fun that people end up losing their mind because of it? And in that losing of their mind they end up finding themselves. Maybe that’s the death that David Foster Wallace was talking about in this people. That’s what he was searching for in his writing (which is awesome, I have to say). What if the film does not have as a consequence the biological death but more of a psychological one? What if the one that dies is the ego? And what comes at the other side of this? These are all explorations into something that in my mind is inevitable. It will happen. The only question that I have is: How will you live in the absence of it? What would you prioritize if mind was not the interface with which you interact with the world, but just a tool that you have at your disposal for it? What would you give your energy too?

I may write. Keep writing. I mean, the problem is that the barrel will become empty of creativity. As if it was like that that it works. It doesn’t work like that, and I know it. It is an eternal flow of creativity to which I can just tap into, and what I’m doing here is preparing the ground for that to happen. We have all the systems in place for this flow to be expressed through each one of us. Maybe not yet completely, but we are moving towards that. We are moving towards the world on which we are all free, free from the stories, free from the burden, free from the willingness to evolve, free from wanting to wake up, free from everything. I just want to help, you know? And which is the mission that I want to help in? I truly don’t know. Every day that passes I’m a little bit more lost. I know a little less about what the future brings. And I accept it a little bit more every day. I let it go. I won’t be able to read every book. I won’t be able to speak to all the persons, I won’t be able to do anything different from what is right here, right now. And that is the only that I know. I only know that I don’t know. I only know that I’m here sharpening the tools of my mind so that I can navigate the uncertainty with trust. With gratitude. With an open mind.

With gratitude for all what life has given me as a present: Partner, Daughter, Mother, Father, Brother, Partner, my capacity for coming up with cool new stuff, and the understanding that I may have about life, which I appreciate a lot. And let’s say, not the understanding that I have about life, but the understanding that I have of MY life. Of my own one. I can’t pretend to know anything about anyone but myself. I am the own master of my story, I am the one that is here writing it, I am the one that has been witnessing through my eyes all this time, and it is perfect like that. I am here, I have always been, and in this explorations I have -hopefully- become more of myself.

Something that came to mind and that I did not talk about before is how amazing it is to find pieces of writing that you have lost for a long time. Yesterday I found a paper from the time on which I went to university, and it was very powerful. Because of what was there, I realized the fact that we only see what we want to see. The writing was from 2019, and in it you could already see the words ‘metaverse’ and ‘blockchain’ written. These concepts came to my mind very recently, I don’t know how actually. I cannot trace back the moment on which I got interested in crypto. I don’t have any clue about it. But now what I know is that there is a lot of value in that ecosystem for me, and that I’m going to give my best so that I can build something cool that adds value to the world. There are very few meditation retreats online, and what I’m going to create in there is awesome. Who knows what it will end up being, that’s how I work. I will do my best to erase any kind of expectation that I may have, and just open the door for the creative aspect of myself to manifest through my actions. I will just show up, every day, and make the progress that feels right. I will surrender to the guide of others, so that I can walk the path that has been laid in front of me. I will just trust, in life, in the people, and in what will have brought me to that place. I’m just part of it. I’m part of what it takes. I am what it takes. There is a lot of things that need to unfold, to be discovered, to be explored, but what I truly know is that it is time to build cool shit. And I’m here to do that, with everything that I have. What if what I’m going to write is an application to bring the whole community together? But the problem with that is that there are too many limitations. I need to publish it on the app store, and publish some guidelines. I don’t want to fix myself in that. The future is the open internet, and the way on which it will work is that everything will work through something like google chrome of brave. And just because it is more decentralized. It is easier to be open sourced. More and more people can help. Everything needs to be public, everything needs to be built for the publich. That’s just how we roll. That’s the game that we are playing. That’s the magic. It's all part of it. It’s all part of the game. Every word that I have written today is just that, a reminder to play the game. To stick to it. To trust. The universe is watching.
