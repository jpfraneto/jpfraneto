This manifesto started as an exploration into what is going to be behind the DAO that I’m going to help create, and after a while a loose track and I end up everywhere instead of where I should be. And there comes that mighty word again, making its appearance on the first line of today. What I should be doing instead of what I’m doing. There goes the noise again. That noise of wanting to be different, elsewhere. Thinking that everything should be changed because it is not in the proper place. It is in the proper place! And everything that I have done here is to clean my unconscious so that I can have a better understanding of what I bring into the plate. Which are the motives behind what is being done. And that is the magic. And that is all that it takes. Nothing else, and nothing less. Every moment that I spend building this thing is a moment on which it is clearer what will happen.

For example yesterday I recorded a new podcast episode and I could ask: What was the important part of it? What did it bring into myself? How does the podcast inform what I’m doing? And the answer is that it is in every sense. All what I’m creating here is just the future on which I want to build, and that future is based on creativity, on sitting down to Do The Work. On being vulnerable, open, and willing to go into the aspects of the self that are hard to deal with. That’s what has been happening here, and it is time for me to acknowledge that. Nothing is ever enough in my world, and what I write here is also an expression of that. I have written until now during 51 days in a row, 206936 words. If that was a book, which roughly account to almost 700 pages. I know that the quality of something is not determined by the length of it, but my upbringing makes me see value in this way. It is my duty to come back and erase most of it so that there can be something concise in here that can be transferred into the world and be read by someone, but it is a lot. And I’m not able to acknowledge it because it is never enough. Nothing is ever enough. It is expressed in every part of what I do. And that’s why I’m writing this book. Because I’m really tired that nothing is ever enough. I eat sugar and I can’t have enough. I smoke weed and I could always be a bit higher. I have drugs and the experience could always be a little stronger. It is never enough, and I realized in the retreat that that is a landmark, a sign, a characteristic of someone that is on the right path for awakening. That’s what Dukkha is about. The perpetual suffering because of nothing is enough. Eternal dissatisfaction. That is the game that is being played here, the one of not being satisfied. I can write a 1000 page manifesto of what makes me not be satisfied and I could still feel like that. And I’m done with it. It is enough. And that’s why I’m here, to explore what is at the other side. To realize that it is the game that I have set up to play, and that it will end in one moment. In the moment on which I realize my true nature, the truth of my being, of who I am, of what I am. And I’m willing to do anything that takes to get there, to reach the full potential of my existence. And that potential involves an aspect of myself being anonymous. The place on which I interact with the world. My sense of identity can’t be attached to it, because if it is I will never be free. And that’s why my role in this game is publicly being a breathwork practitioner and helping people with that incredible skill, and on another side being an active creator and builder in the future of the internet. That kind of clarity has arisen through this writing, and that is eternally valuable for me. That is the kind of thing that I’m doing here, as I integrate more and more all the experiences that I’ve had into what I can do now. That is what creativity is about. The great reset. Yes. That is what people need. The great reset. The big reset, connecting deep with themselves. Waking up. Why not? This is the moment. And Dukkha is all about that. The organization that is being built through this manifesto is all about that. And the key in it will be randomness. That is the magic of it. It being random. Life becoming the intersection of a music festival and a meditation retreat. That is the whole purpose of this adventure that I’m on. How to bring those worlds together in daily life? That is what I’m bringing into my own life. The acknowledgment of what needs to be done so that I can do it. And that is the magic. That is the key.

We don’t have to be there at the same time meditating, or working, work whatever, but we can record ourselves doing it so that the world can know that we did it. And upload it to the cloud as part of what is being done in that space. I’m thinking about a live meditation with the samadhi center, on which each window that I see is an exploration into what is being done there. And what is being done there is just a person sitting down and doing his thing. How would it look like if more and more people did that? How would it look like if it was the asynchronous meditation retreat and music festival? We come together to do our thing, but we are not there in the same time. What is time anyway? We are sharing ourselves so that we can be connected to others, but does it need to be synchronous? I don’t think so. It can’t be. Because it is exclusive and centralized. And the future is inclusive and decentralized. It needs to be asynchronous, and each day the schedule for that day has to be released from beforehand. The guided meditation, the album of the day, the deep work session music, the piece of media. Everything needs to be published from before, so that we can be clear with the calendar. So that we can truly follow along as a community, but not with the burden of having to be in the same place, at the same time. There can be nodes of people doing stuff at the ‘recommended time’. Yes, that sounds nice. People organizing organically to do the work. To show up for each other. That is always what is most helpful in all this kind of networks, to let people do their thing and give them freedom. If I say that every day the meditation will be at 7am, I close the door for those that can’t make it. But if there is people all over the world organizing events to be in sync with ‘their’ 7am, it is perfect. At the end of the day, creative work is generally not connected to others directly. You go into your own world, and from there gather the insights that you can bring to the outside. But the important part happens in your world, in the safe space that is built in the place where the act of creation melts with the creator and what is being created. And we go into that place on our own, gathering the strength that is necessary for overcoming resistance. But it is a lonely process.

It is as if I wanted to go to the realm of the ancestors by taking ayahuasca for you. I just can’t. It is not within the realm of possibilities to go into the experience for another person, and the same accounts for creative work. It is something that you have to do from the depth of who you are, and give you the space and freedom to do it. And that’s what all the masters have told, all the big creative voices of history. You need systems in place. You need to show up consistently. That is all what matters, consistency, and this is the place where that consistency will be fostered. We will show up, there will be systems in place for that, but at the end of the day you will be alone. But you will feel the power, the strength, the voice of others. We will all be the saviors of the others. We will all be there for each other. It is going to be a transformational journey, one which will turn your whole world upside down. But what comes at the other side of your world being turned upside down? How does it feel if there is a network of humans in place going through the same thing? You won’t fall to the void. We are the ones holding the feathers bed. Each of us is part of that bed, and we are all in this together.

It is so easy for me to forget about what I’m doing, and become lost in the how. The how is not as important as the why, and this whole book is an expression of the why. Because of the maze of the mind. Because of the loneliness. Because we are all humans, and because there is a movement going on. There is something that will fundamentally change the way on which we relate to each other, and that something is starting to come to life soon. It has already started. And it is time for this. And here, with this book, and putting the first stone of the thing. Who am I to say that this is the first stone? It isn’t. All the stones are already in place, this is just another one that aims to add my cent to the whole process. I’m no one to say that I’m putting the first stone. That is not my mission. My mission is just to show up for myself, for my writing, for what I care about, and from there explore the infinite possibilities of what can come next. That is the magic of this whole thing. There is no limit, and in this writing I explore what happens in myself when I lower the limits and boundaries that are within myself. I think of me as a person that is not capable of building amazing things, and all what is happening here is an exploration into the truth that that is not true. I am capable, I have been doing it all this time, and this manifesto is the means by which I acknowledge that. I overcome the fear that I have inside of not being enough, of not bringing out of life what I could have brought. Of not doing what I should be doing. I’m working every day on the creation of this book because I care about it enough, and because I want to be in service. I truly want to be in service of what comes, of the future on which my daughter will grow, and by repeating myself over and over I become more of it. It is not a problem if I repeat myself more than once, it is just what is present in this moment. And that is my truth right now. My truth is repeated because it is that, my truth. I can’t avoid it. I just can go with it and embrace every aspect of what is being repeated, because it is the information that wants to come forth the most.

There is a fundamentally important aspect of what I’m doing here that is related to what comes to the surface by just showing up. With myself. Facing the blank, the void, the blankness of the white page. Where can you start if there could be infinite places where to start? And this is the answer. 210k words after, I still don’t have anywhere to start, and it is perfect, because I have already started. And I’m here, I have travelled this path, and I know what it feels to sit down and just Do The Work. Show up. Over and over again. There is no one telling me what to do, I am just doing it for myself. I don’t even have the feedback of the people that care about what I do telling me more of what I should do. I’m just here with myself. Showing up for myself, and for the future, by being present with who I am, right now. It’s incredible that I have not been able to acknowledge the road that I have travelled until now. Time flies by, and here I am, showing up, over and over again. It doesn’t matter if the book is good or not, it just matters that it is. The sole expression of me running in circles is valuable enough, because you have also been there. You just don’t want to acknowledge it, or to see it. It may be hard to go out of the normal flow of life and realize the ways on which you are deceiving yourself. But it is part of the game. Here, I’m using the capacities that life has given me to show you that there is another way out. There is something valuable in you, and it is time for you to share that with the world. To be open to it. To show up. For yourself. That is the thing, at the end, you’ve just got to show up for yourself. The rest ends up happening because of that.

That’s why I did not connect with that Twitter course, because they always taught that for becoming really good at the game you had to evolve the content that you were creating having in mind the users that were going to read it. And that for me was never resonant enough, because I truly don’t enjoy doing things because other people like me to do them. When I write and someone tells me that it was cool I like it, but it is not what drives my actions. At least for now it isn’t. There are all this magical AI tools that drive engagement using the nice words that I could use, but it would feel fake. But what if that fakeness is the truth, because I can come here and write as I write now, and make it go through that AI and with that bring it closer to the general public. Because that is the challenge that I have always had, bringing my message to the general public. What if this was the way on which I could bring my message to the general public? By having an AI that could translate it into words that are more understandable by it. That sounds cool. AI assistants that translate who you are into the words of the person that is consuming. You get the flavor of the person that created the thing, but not with the particular way of writing that he used. I wonder if this would catch up. Maybe. I don’t know. But what does it matter in the context of what is being discussed here? Does it truly matter to have an AI assistant if you can just be yourself and share you with the world as you are?

I will frame the problem with that from my own experience. I love podcasting, and yesterday I had an amazing interview. I could spend so much time editing it, but it would be time lost. There can be AI tools that can be better at that than me. Why not use them? Why not bring them on? The same goes with writing. I have been writing for 40 minutes-ish until now and it feels great. But I don’t like editing what I write, I even don’t like reading it again. It is part of the past. It is what was created, and it is like it is. But it is not ready for the public to ingest. How can I bring this into the public and tell them to read 30 minutes of me ranting about whatever comes to mind? It is not fair. In the world of today, that is not fair. But I can do something with AI and bring it to the table so that I can have my stuff summarized and with that better received by the general public. That is something that goes a lot through my mind, and I wonder if it is too hard to do. Probably it will become easier and easier, as more and more technology is developed. Where will we end when that happens? How will the world look like when there is a robot that can summarize me who I am better than the perception that you have of me? That perception is biased, and what I’m talking here is about overcoming those biases by using a technology that doesn’t have any tendencies per-se.

Depression is the mother of all diseases. It is the source. The lack of willingness to live a life full of wonder because of a full identification with the self structure, till the last part of your nervous system. It is time for us to go out of the maze of the mind. It is time to wake up. It is time to Do The Work to wake up. It is time to shine. What comes at the other side of the identification with the self-structure? An explosion of creativity. An explosion of people showing up to just create for the sake of it. That is the game that is going to be played. And right now I’m here in the office understanding what my role in this place is. This is the present that working with my father brought to me, the capacity for being in this office and enjoying every part of it. This place is truly perfect. It is the dream. I did not know it before, but that is what is going on in here, and it is up to me to live it as if it was as nice as it could be. It is my mission to start bringing more and more of who I am into this place. Before coming back to write I danced, and I realized that I haven’t done it for quite a while. And it felt amazing. It felt freeing. It felt like something that my body needed to loosen up that energy, and to melt into the rhythms of what was being played. I had not given me the opportunity to do it before, and it feels amazing.

I keep thinking about ‘what I should do with my life’. What is this about. What is the best usage of my time. Etc. Etc. Etc. And the thing that comes is that I already know. I have to be always doing new things. I have to be always learning new skills. I will make a list of skills and start doing them, one after the other. That is the future of what I will do. Shine my creativity through the lens of 10000 different things. Each 88 day period just build something new, just create something new, from scratch, from a place where I have not been before. Just show up and do my thing for those 4 hours. Give myself fully to what comes in those 4 hours. The consequence of every internal work that you do is a deeper capacity for being present, and the state of being that is more connected to presence is the creative act. You are through the act of creation. The more ‘healed’ you are, the more necessity you have to create. It is just part of the game. Open up to share the wonders of who you are with the world, just by creating. Just by sharing your creations.

Opening up to the world, bringing it in as the means for exploring who I am by interacting with those that want to show up. That is what comes in this chapter of my life. Sharing how much I care with those that want to be there. Sharing all my presence, and all of what I am, and my truth, with them. Without any conditions, without any preconceptions, without any willingness to be something different from what I already am. Just being. Just expressing the truth of who I am with the ones that want to listen. That is the game that I’m playing, that is the game that is being manifested through me. The one of no excuses, the one of not wanting to be someone specific, the one of just being the truth of who I am. The one of just manifesting that truth through my own actions. The one of being those actions, and embodying them into what I do. Just being. Just sharing who I am. Learning to live by witnessing with honor and attention how others have lived. That is the starting point. Learning how to live. Each person in the world has something to teach me related to how to live. You know it. You have always known it. You already know how to live. It is just part of who you are. And who you have always been. You already know how to live, and each human being that has been alive until now has been a manifestation of that, because you are them. You are through each being that has ever been, and it is just part of the division of mind which is not able to let you realize that completely. But what happens when there is a shift in perception? When there is a transformation in the way of experiencing life because of the realization of your true nature? I don’t really know because I don’t experience life from that place, but I have a conceptual understanding of it. There is knowledge in me related to this, but not one that comes from my direct experience. It is the knowledge that comes from trusting those that have already walked the path. Those that have been there. Those that have the experience of being in a particular place, in a particular time. Those are the ones that know. And that is all what it takes. Just being there for life. Showing up. Caring. That is all what is needed. Showing up. Realizing that life is just a game to be played. And be there for it. Show up for the game. Learn how to play it. It is time to play the game. It is time to show up for each other. It is time to explore what is at the other side of the boundaries. Of the division. Of mind. What is at the other side of mind? Today I explored a bit of that, but without a clear understanding of it. I just dealt with it. I just explored it without knowing truly what to expect. I’m just writing words now, the focus seems to have been lost inside the excitement that comes from not wanting to be something specific. From having inside the knowing that the only important thing at this moment of history is to show up and care enough about what is being done.

Show up for others, that is the deepest aspect of community. That is the one that matters at the end of the day. That is how you grow, that is how you learn. By just being yourself. By just experimenting life from the place of being who you already are. Who you have always been. I shared myself, my truth, my willingness to help and it can feel overwhelming, it can feel like too much, it is easy for me to feel like an imposter, but it is just what it is. Show up for others and witness what comes from there. What is the worst thing that can happen? People can point you with the finger. But what is the problem with that? What happens with that? I don’t really know. I don’t really care. I have cared enough already, and it is time for me to stop caring. To just realize that there is value in who I am, in what I’m doing, in my presence, and just be there for what comes. That is the secret sauce that is brought to the world by just showing up as you are. Right here, right now. Without any preconception of what can be. Of just what is. Just sharing myself with the intention to add value to another person is enough. What can happen from there? This is the maze of my own mind. The maze that is present in me when I doubt myself, when I doubt what I bring, when I doubt the way on which I share myself. All the 210k words that I have written here are the means by which I don’t trust myself. They are me, running around in circles, expressing how much I don’t trust myself. My true self. But that is over. How can I embody awakening if I’m not even able to trust myself enough to do it? It is time for that to happen. It is time for me to realize that it is time for me to just show up. With my truth. Without caring about the consequences of it. I think that the game is played by yelling in social media for attention, and it is not like that. That is not what happens. That is not the game that needs to be player. Nope, not at all. The game that needs to be played is to be strategic, to realize which are the places on which I’m going to shine, and from there move on. Simplicity is the key. I am the key. My own simplicity and willingness to shine are the key. There is nothing more than that that matters. Nothing else matters. Being simple and straightforward and direct and true is what matters. Nowadays, I can post something somewhere and truly don’t know which are going to be the consequences of it. One day it will catch up. And how am I going to show up when that day comes? Am I still going to show up with my truth? Am I still going to be there for that truth? How does it change when there are more eyes in what I do? How does it evolve when the life of other people depend on what I say or do? It is just part of the process to navigate those waters. I don’t know, because I haven’t been there, and whatever I could build as the means by which I could create a history in my mind related to what will happen is just that, a history that I tell myself. It is nothing more than a history that is inside my mind, and by sharing that history with the world I open up the possibility for healing. For becoming more and more of me.

Healing is being present with my truth, whatever it may be. Healing is being present to the integration of everything that has happened until now. Healing is the integration of all of what you are. Healing is just being. Without the biases of the mind, without the stories that are told inside there. Just with what is. Whatever it may be. It doesn’t really matter. It just matters that it is. You can spend your whole lifetime trying to make sense, trying to find answers, trying to fix whatever happened. It won’t end. But what happen is that you make peace with the fact that it won’t end. And that brings about the possibility to true healing, by just opening to what is present right here, right now. That is what healing is about, opening up to the possibility of each moment of your life as the means for healing. Every moment is a window into the unknown. Every second of life is a journey into what is possible when there is no preconception of what should happen. The ultimate way of being is just being. Without any shoulds. The ultimate way of being is the absence of shoulds. The presence of presence. Just being. Just expressing who you are by sharing your complete being with what is in front of you. That is the way on which you can bring the most out of reality. By just being yourself, whomever you may be in this moment. You are not the character that you have been playing, you are way beyond that. We are getting into the point of history, to the moment in humanity on which we realize this in a collective scale. And what comes out of that is joy. Is creativity. Is magic. Welcome to the age of magic, on which we connect to the wonder of what being alive means.

Welcome to the next stage of your life. Of our life. Welcome to the new stage of humanity. Are you ready? Buckle up, because it is going to be a rollercoaster.

I don’t have too many things that I have published because nothing can encompass who I am better than what I’m writing right now. How can I say that if this is the 51nd day in a row on which I publish content? How can I be that rude to myself? Come on. I spoke about it previously, and it is time to acknowledge it again. I’ve showed up. I’ve done the work. Come on. Bring it on. It is time to be present. It is time to be more of myself.
