There is great information in the way I have been doing stuff until now, and it is time for me to take that information and use it and implement it in ways that can help me move forward with more strength and understanding of which are the next steps that I should take in my life. Right now, before coming here I told myself that I would go to twitter and do the routine of answering to 8 people before coming into work because it would be great to be social. And it was not great, because the ripples of what I commented yesterday are there, and those ripples are not fun because there is a lot of hate in them. And I don’t want to start my day with hate, so now I realize that the way on which I can help myself is to actually go in there later, in the afternoon, after having come here to do my creative work of the day. What is present now in there is the consequences of what happened yesterday, because the people that are mostly active right now are sleeping. So to be intentional with the usage of the tools that I have at hand now is also to realize which is a good moment of the day to go into this places to do what I want to do, and definetly going in now was not a good idea because it brought into me stuff that is not helpful for my creative process.

I mean, my creative process right now is processing all of my life experience into this moment, and integrate it fully, and in that sense, it definitely informed what I’m writing now and I’m integrating it so it was helpful in some way. Everything that happens can end up being helpful if I just allow it to be. If I inform what I’m doing from there. But I don’t know how would it be if I would be writing a novel for example, or another kind of story. How would my relationship with my work change because of what I saw and read and received by going in there? That’s something that I need to have in mind so that I can better understand how to bring more and more of that into my life. Yes, the last days my writing is becoming worse, I think so, but it is just part of what is. It is what is coming now, and probably it is a consequence of me not being in a good place in the last days. My relationship with my wife is in a bad place, we have not been able to connect with each other in a way that makes us feel happy both, and it has been intense. This comes in a moment on which we are going to move to another city for 1 month to visit her family, so it is challenging to say the least. How is this challenge processed in the eyes of what is going on in my life? What is it that is going on in my life? I think that I’m good and cool and all this stories that I tell myself because I come here and write 10 pages of nonsense, but, am I truly someone that is doing something helpful because of that? Which is the impact that I’m having in the world? If I come here and write 800 pages of me ranting against myself, and no one will ever read this pages, am I bringing something of value into the world? And when I ask that question, what does that value mean? What truly is value? I don’t really understand the answer to it yet, and it is becoming more and more unclear. Because I’m doing something that has an impact which I can’t demonstrate. I can’t realize which the impact is. But there is an impact. It ripples into the future, and it is the universe moving in ways that cannot be understood.

For example, yesterday I commented something on Twitter related to a programmer that is helping the software of Twitter become something different, adding a small feature, and the ripples are about this thing being nonsense. Such a minor change that won’t have an impact. But the sole fact that this person is doing that is already changing the whole thing because there is people that are aware of what he is doing and there is a lot of buzz and talk happening because of that. Maybe the fact that he is doing something that doesn’t have enough sense is the point, because in that talk there is information related to how people react to stuff being done in public. He is open about it, and that is the whole game. He is playing a game, he is just playing a game about something very simple that is being done in public, and that is everything that is needed in order for the thing to progress. Because all of the hype that is being produced because of him doing his thing is already the work that needed to be done in order to make progress. Elon told him: fix the less used feature in the whole platform so that people can start talking about this thing. So that there is a conversation going on, and that conversation points towards the long term objective of having all the source code open source’d.

Ok, time to come back, as always bringing into this moment the understanding of where I am at. The understanding of how what I have done informs what I am. I’m listening to music that is in Portuguese, and thinking about all those incredible moments that I spent travelling through Brazil.

Don’t take yourself too seriously. Don’t take myself too seriously. That is the message of today, and that is the message that I just should be sharing with the world at each moment, every day. What is going on in here is just an exploration into that, into what comes every day as the information that will allow me to just be present with what is. I remember in the retreat that there was a moment on which I thought to myself: What if I just allow me to make fun of myself all the time? What if big I starts being the bully of small I by just exploring how it feels to be ridiculous? How does life feel when I am ridiculous? Who is the one that feels embarrassed? Who is the one that gets too identified with stuff that he can’t help but not do it? It is funny, because this happens to me much more on the internet than IRL. When I’m walking through the streets, interacting with people, I don’t have any problem to just be there sharing that moment with them. I explore life through my interaction with that people. But on the internet, there seems to be a more shallow approach to that, which is expressed by the way on which people react to whatever is going on. But yeah, I don’t really know. I’m just beginning to be a citizen of the internet, and what I say is that I don’t understand how to do it properly. But what if there are no proper things? What if there are no absolutes on this thing? What if there is not an specific way on which to relate with the whole internet thing? What if that is the same with life overall? What if that is the same as with the creative process?

I can see myself throughout my life, not giving my best because of the fear of not being good enough. But the realization that is missing there is the one that comes from there is that I’m always in a particular level of development, whatever the skill that I’m training is. I’m always starting somewhere, and it is just by relating to the thing that I’m doing in that moment with my truth that I will be able to interact deeper with it. And through that, I’ll become better at it. Let’s take as an example my whole relationship with Twitter. If I tell myself the story of me not being enough because I don’t understand how people behave on the internet, I close the door for them to witness how a person that doesn’t know their codes works. Or behaves. Or interacts. If I don’t share my voice I close that door, and is it a door that should be closed? Is it a door that should be closed? That is something that I wonder, because on the last 2 days I have brought into life more than one tweet that has gotten a lot of people interacting with it, and this means that I have the potential of building some fire in the places where I interact. And how is this fire going to be unleashed? How am I going to navigate those waters? In parts of my life I have thought about myself as the one that drops the bomb and then goes away to see how it explodes. That is part of what I intended to do with the open source factory, place on which I created a software system every month and then leave it there, for people to interact with it, for it to evolve on its own. Through that process, I would be able to iterate over what was being created and let it be more and more cool by the people that could interact with it in the future. And that is what is needed right now, and I’m just running in circles with it because I can go in and build that project again by just having people that want to learn how to code. I can build a team of 8 people and we can work together in the creation of that system, and eventually there will be enough learning from what we are building that they will become employable through the means of creation. Everything that we do can be open source’d, and more and more people can contribute to it after it is published. We can have a feedback state every month.

My goal is that every piece of work that I do is at the beginning free. For it to work properly, it should be monetized, but that monetization will end up being something that will happen with people afterwards. I always end up coming back to the vipassana style of charging for stuff. You offer the value, and then people can back prizing it to realize how much they brought out of it. That is what I’m creating here and I don’t realize it yet. I’m building a system, a system that will enable my creativity to explode. All this book is an exploration into how that system will be created over time. It is an exploration into how that system looks like, and into how it feels to build something truly valuable. Truly amazing. I haven’t been able to realize it yet, but I’m getting there. I’m getting there with the understanding of how this whole thing will be. With the understanding of who are the people that are going to build this thing. That’s the thing with the internet, there doesn’t need to be permission anymore. Everything that is done, everything that is created, is just an expression of who people are. And in that openness there is immense value, because more and more people will be able to benefit from that. Over time. We are just at the beginning of this whole thing, because the way on which value is structured in society is off. We value our time with the amount of money that someone is willing to pay us, and that is determined beforehand. But how can you know the value that ends up being generated because of what you did? What if there was a system that could really determine which was the value added by an individual to a whole ecosystem and through that value that individual could be transferred the amount of money that was generated because of that value that was added?

For example, for the guy that is building this search thing in Twitter. What if there was a system to calculate which is the impact of that thing and he was paid because of that impact? But isn’t that impossible to calculate? Because right now there are people having this conversation in the bottom of what I wrote, and because of that conversation, there is something being moved in what this guy is creating. How can the value of that conversation be quantified? Is there even a way to do that? I don’t think so. It is just so hard. So what ends up happening is that it is a maze, which doesn’t seem to have a direct exit. And if I open my thing and do all the work that I do with the capacity for people paying me back for the value that they got out of it, how would that feel? Who will be the ones that pay for a work that was done in the open source factory? The builders or the users? Is there a way to even calculate that? Who am I providing value to?

There is not a clear answer to that because all the time that I was working on the open source factory the last year I was hiding inside my own bubble. There was no feedback coming from the outside, and because of that, I was just running on the back of my tail. What if I do a v2 version of the open source factory and I allow myself to just open up the possibility for people to give feedback every day. What if every day becomes the means by which people give more and more feedback? How would the evolution of the project be if I opened up for this? There doesn’t seem to exist something like this, and it feels like a great idea. I feel that there is a lot of value on that, and that I could learn more and more about what I can create because of it. But that is just me, projecting into the future, and building in my mind another thing to do. Another adventure to the list of things that I can do when I end writing this book. And everything that comes to mind has involved not earning money directly. It is so funny how my whole system is structured from the perspective of this thing being built for free. But I can crowdfund. I can open up the wallet and let people donate and if I reach the end of the month and there is nothing in there I can quit, and if there is something in there, enough for me to survive, I can do it again next month. And I can stay like that, over and over, if I receive the amount of money that I need to survive. That is the world on which we live today, and the opportunities are endless. Who are the people that I’m serving? Is it even worth it to be building different projects every month? Isn’t this an expression of the problem that I always have, related to me not being able to finish what I’m doing?

I can see that expressed in my daughter also. It’s funny how she ends up being a reflection of her parents. I see her starting something and as she is doing it going for the next one. It happens when she eats. She is chewing something and already asking for the next piece to come. And this is also expressed in myself as I think more and more about these projects. Is it that I’m just building something that is not useful or am I building something useful and it is just that I’m not realizing it yet? Because I think about building something and then crowdfunding it, but that is solely because I don’t trust in my work enough. What if I built a great tool for twitter and I opened it to the public and then offered twitter to buy it? What if Twitter had a library of plugins that could be embedded in my experience of it as if it was a browser like chrome or brave? What if we could create twitter extensions like that, and each project of the open source factory was one of those? What if I create stuff with the sole intention of making a service that we all use better? What if I created stuff with the sole intention of educating the public? How would that look like? How would my interaction with the world evolve if I was intentional about what I’m building? That is the thing, if I don’t have this in mind, I will never be able to create something valuable enough that people will want to use it. Or not? Probably this is not correct, because this sole book is an example of that. I’m writing it just to bring it out of myself, without the intention for it to be something specific for anyone. Maybe you are reading it right now and thinking to yourself: Hey brother, it did help me. You didn’t realize, but the fact that you wrote it for no one talked to me because I am that no one and it has been valuable in ny life so I want to express gratitude to you for it. I will never know. That is the thing. You’ll never know if what you create without feedback will end up resonating with anyone. But at the end of the day, does it even matter? If I do it not for the others but for myself, if the consequences of writing it are beuond my undeestanding right now, and the impact that it is having in my relationship with myself and with life is way beyond what I can understand right now, is it not valuable? And the same goes for those projects that I created as I was working on the open source factory. Each one of those projects that I build has information in them related to who I am In that moment. Who I was. And what it was that I was trying to bring into the world. Isn’t this very valuable and important information? Don’t underestimate the power that the invisible has. It is the same as what is happening in Twitter with what I commented. There is a conversation going on inside there that is a consequence of what I published, and that conversation is going somewhere that may not be clear for those who are involved. They may nobe aware of those consequences. So how can I evaluate them beforehand? It seems I can’t. It seems that there is no role to be played by trying to understand the consequences of what I’m doing, because they cannot be understood. They just can be experienced, and that experience is the value of the process itself. The creation ends up being a manifestation of who I am as an individual, and that is what the world needs right now. For people to share their individuality, so that we can get more and more of it through our lifes. And grow with it. If you share with me your own particular truth, I become more of mine. Of course there could be a hardcore linguisting debating this and telling me that I’m wrong, but what does it matter? It is just what came up, and it doesn’t help me at all to torture myself from that lack of wisdom or intelligence or whatever it may be lacking in my words. It is just coming through right now as that, and it is perfect like it. It doesn’t really matter if it is not correct. It just matters that it is, because in the act of creation there is an inherent transformation of the self that ends up having consequences that are way beyond the act of creation itself.

This act is the means by which I impact the world, and in that impact there ends up being something more that comes up as I open the doors of my creativity to flow. Because this is the doors of my creativity been opened, expressed and realized through the words that I’m writing. And the same goes for the act of creating a website, but the thing in there is: is it a pure act of creation if it requires the feedback from the consumer of it to evolve? How distorted is my message if I allow myself to transform what I’m sharing with the world because of what the world is giving back to me? There is no clarity in that regard with me right now. I’m not sure where I land with it. I can see the world and how it has developed itself in the past, and the inventions that have been brought into it: Have they had this feedback loop incorporated inside? I’m thinking about the iPhone: did they develop it with the feedback of the user in mind or did they just build the thing and with it they gathered the feedback on how to evolve it afterwards? I don’t really know. I don’t have a clue. What comes with the software systems is that they are too complex, and I don’t have the tools and resources inside me to develop systems that are as robust as they could be. I think about Drip Work for example, an app that I created for doing deep work sessions, and how it ends up being very hard because if there is enough people in there it can get crazy. And it can be very, very complex, and I don’t have the resources to understand how to manage that complexity, neither to build for it. Am I farting over my ass here trying to build systems that are beyond what I can understand? But isn’t that the game? Isn’t that the cool thing? For me to be able to build those things and show up and use them as the means for exploring better what they are and what they can bring into the world. For example for doing deep work sessions: Is there an app that can do these kinds of things? How can I use every tool that I develop as the building block of the one that will come in the future? How can each app build on top of the one that was there before? Which are the means by which this can happen? I think that an intelligent move is using Twitter as the oAuth thing. Twitter is the social media of the future, I’m sure about that. How can I modularize each app that I create so that it can be consistent with this app on its building? I wonder. And everything that I’m doing here is just wondering, and just trying to think about what I’m doing. What I’m going to create. There seems to be many, many options, and this seems to get more and more complicated. My own thought process is getting more complicated, and I don’t seem to be able to realize in a good way what is it that I’m going to bring into the world. And why do I talk in the future? What I’m bringing into the world. What is it that I’m bringing into the world right now? What I will bring afterwards will be a consequence of that, I’m building the foundations of my work here, and it is important to acknowledge that and build from there. Which are the tools that I’m going to build? How are those tools going to interact with what is in place? How am I going to be helpful for the world? Is it necessary for me to build one different app every month or I just need to focus on one. I don’t know. It is a maze. And I’m deep into that maze, but I just need to be intelligent enough to realize which it the thing that I can build that can bring me enough money so that I can survive. And in that sense, what I can build is something that helps a particular business to thrive. For example, the other day I had on Instagram an ad related to a company here in my country that helps the stakeholders to develop healthy habits. So they were offering a 21 page pdf with means for developing a healthy habit. I wonder: was that even helpful for anyone? Did anyone even read that? That number must be very low. But what if I develop a tool so that people can truly become more consistent with their changing of habit and I can sell that tool for that company? Isn’t that a good way of earning enough money so that I can survive? And that is when I go back to this creativity forced by the amount of money that I end up receiving. I base the value of what I do in the amount of money that I get from it, and I’m going through that rabbit hole right now. Holy shit, my writing is full of contradictions. I am full of contradictions, I am a big maze and bag of contradictions. Each one after the next one. I go to one place and then I turn around and go to another one. That is the thing. That is Dukkha. This is the maze of my own mind, where I go round and round into the ideas that come up, that pop up as interesting, without even doing one properly. What does it take for me to do one properly? Which is the world on which I do one properly? What does properly mean? In a clear and monetizable way. That is the thing. I need to be able to monetize something so that I can live from it, and in this writing I’m just exploring the ideas that come from there. But that is the thing, if I start from there I’m perpetuating this game of fear of the future, of scarcity. And that’s where I’ve been today. With plenty of scarcity going on. I just started the day not being able to push through the meditation because it was too hard, and I gave up. I also gave up walking up early, so there were a lot of setbacks at the beginning of the day. Is that a favor that I’m doing myself or is it just the way on which I learn more and more about what I’m doing? About myself? I’m just figuring myself out in this game. I’m just understanding better which is the character that is being played here by me. And that is what is needed, that is the game that I need to keep playing. The one of experiencing who I am when I leave myself aside and I just explore what is. Who am I when I just am? What remains? Who is the one that is writing when there is no one writing? That is the thing that I’m learning to do here, leave myself aside, and the fact that I have had everything material that I have asked for in my life definitely makes it harder. Because I’m always looking for the perfect thing to do. And because of that, everything I do, I do it in half. I never finish it. I pick and pick and pick stuff and I’m never fully committed to what is at hand. That is the expression of what I want to build in this project called the open source factory, because it is about just creating something in half and then running to the next one. But is it truly creating it in half if I will work on it for one month? I’m not sure about it. I doubt it. It is just that I don’t know enough about what I’m doing, and I don’t trust myself enough, but I can definetly be commited to do something and just do it wholeheartedly until the world gives me an answer back. And that is maybe why I feel back with myself, because I have not been able to commit to this fully. I jump from one thing to the next one just because I’m looking for the perfect one to do, not realizing that the perfection is just in the fact that I’m being. That I’m existing. And each word that I write is just an exploration into separation, into what is at the other side of acceptance. What if I accept that I’m a chameleon, and I experience life from that understanding? What if I truly work for 4 hours every day full on, and then I give myself the time throughout the day to process what happened on those 4 hours? What if I give myself the permission to do that?

Maybe that is why I feel bad with myself, because I have not been able to give me the permission to do this properly. I know that properly means showing up and giving my best, and I know that I have not been able to do that. Because life puts itself on my way. I jump from one place to the next one, and what ends up happening is that I don’t do anything properly. And it ends up being noise. Do I want it to be noise? Do I want it to work like this? Of course not. And that is the thing. Let my discipline be the medicine, and the discipline that is shown when I sit down and Do The Work. That is the only way. Just by showing up and writing whatever comes up I will be better able to realize which are my biases, and where do I stand short in this whole game. Just by being the witness of my own fears, of my own short term gains, I will be better able to show myself what I’m lacking. And I won’t be able to see it if I don’t want. If I don’t allow myself. That is the thing men, you’ve got to Do The Work. No one is going to do it for you. No one is going to come here to save you. You’ve got to save yourself. And no one will buy that story of you being a poor little child that is yelling to receive help. Nope, it doesn’t work like that anymore. What works is bringing value to the world, and showing up for people. Showing up for those who care about what is being created, for those that are willing to give feedback, for those that are willing to evolve alongside. There may be haters, all around. Fuck them. What is being created here is way bigger than what any of us can see, and if there is any human being that is not willing to accept that, fuck him. I can’t and won’t spend my valuable life force engaging in the conversation that will bring about more hatred into the world. I just want to bring more of what I want to see, and what I want to see is constructive feedback it is something that we can all build together. And that is the magic of open source. That is the thing. It is not about building X or Y because it can be helpful for this or that group of people. It is just for pushing the open source movement forward, because everything that is created in there is just value that is good for the public. Public goods. And how are they financed? What if the open source factory is actually the DAO that I have been building all this time? What if what we are bringing into the world is that value, the one that comes when we build together? What if The Open Source Factory is the means by which we coordinate together to build the public goods of the future? How does that future look like? How can I manifest it with more clarity? By just bringing in groups of X people, all of them with a particular set of skills, that can build a solution for a particular problem. Whatever that problem may be. May the people come up with the problem that will be solved. It doesn’t matter. And it doesn’t matter if you have good or bad skills related to the problem that is being solved, every day the importance of that is less. What is important is the intention, what you show up with. What do you bring into the conversation? How are you willing to help this beehive to become more of what it can become if each of us is helping it to thrive? Is the analogy of a beehive working? Does this idea resonate with me? How I land with it? That’s the thing, building digital software has always been very exciting, and having people from all over working on it is very, very exciting. But the problem is always funding. Of course people can’t work for free. I’m so used to working for free that I don’t even realize how broken that is. But the thing is that more and more people work for free nowadays and they don’t realize it. All this aspiring solopreneurs on Twitter: working for free. All the people participating in coding bootcamps: working for free.

What if the energy that is spent in all those projects is just unleashed into the building of something that can actually have an impact in the world? How can this system be built? I wonder… I wonder…

That is the cool thing about having this space to imagine, to build the future. I’m just exploring ideas here, without the preconception if they should be good or not. I’m just exploring what comes when I open myself to see if something resonates or not. How does it feel when something resonates? How does it feel to be a leader? How does it feel to be building stuff without having a particular roadmap for it? How does it feel to build, build and build? How does it feel to create an army of people that are willing to explore the realms of themselves by just expressing their creativity into the world without the limitations of how something should look like?

The problem that shows up right now as something that can set me back is the lack of understanding that I have related to the skills that people actually have. What if they don’t have any clue related to what is being built? But there is value in that. Because there are no rights or wrongs, there just are stuff that can be done and in that sense everything they come up with is valuable. If they just show up and interact with whatever is being done, it will already be something that will be valuable. No matter which their level of skill. And that is part of the boundary that I’m trying to delete in society, because there is all this understanding that I spoke about before related to us being not good enough for doing something. I need to learn how to code before I code. And that is something that doesn’t help us. What helps is just having a problem and asking for help on how to do it. That’s how the community is built. I need to add a title to my website, ask to the community. And in that asking, there will be someone readily available to help. That’s the thing. I’m building here the most efficient way to learn how to code, I just hadn’t realized it yet. I’m building a community of people that are learning how to code, and developing the means for it to happen as efficient as it can. That’s right. I’m just learning how to do it. I'm learning how to code by educating people in how to code. Learning how to do it by exploring how it is done. What if you show people a problem that they don’t know how to solve and give them the whole internet to explore how to solve it? Which are going to be the skills that are going to be developed on that? What if we create an army of chameleons? I am one of them, and I will help create an army of them. The army of anon chameleons.

Just exploring what exploring brings into my awareness. Everything ends up being an exploration, and the thing is that it will be useful to bring out the scouting from my mind and bring it into the world. And I have been delaying this for a long time. And where does the breathwork end when I’m doing this? Because I’m working on all this and thinking about what I’m doing and then I’m not realizing that I will train to be a breathwork facilitator so it would be helpful to start bringing the breathwork into the thoughts of what I will create so that I can bring more and more of it into what I’m building so that I can be aligned with everything that I am and everything that I’m doing. How does the healing process align with what I’m doing? So now comes another idea that I have been pondering for a long time, (as I wrote that I realized that it was time to change the music that I had been playing and come back to the classics, which I have not listened to, so now the first symphony of Mahler is being played as the input that my ears will receive for exploring music from that perspective). So yes, an idea that I have been pondering for a long time is the one of building a network of healers that are paid with bitcoin. Think about it as a marketplace for healing work that can be done through zoom, without anything more than what is available normally in the house of a normal person. Breathwork is the best example of this. Astrology, numerology, etc. All these kinds of more obscure arts and ways of being that have the intention to work with something that is beyond what the person can normally experience. And the power of them is increasingly valuable in the times of today, and there isn’t a place on the internet where you can go and tap into the healing realm so that you can find all the people that can help you. What if there is an AI system to which you can describe your problem and that system can point you towards the person that will help you?

But yes, the question that comes now is: Why all this complexity? Where will it bring me? Will I become free by allowing all that complexity to come into my life? I don’t think so. Most of the people that run startups and companies are crazy up to their head with work, and: is that work truly in service of their evolution or is it in service of the evolution of their ego? I don’t really know. That’s the thing. I’m always thinking about building a new future, but how much of this willingness to build is an aspect of my ego that wants to be expressed and manifested and how much of it is that I truly want to do it? Will I give up the afternoons with my little daughter so that I can be more and more engaged in the internet doing stuff and having all these kinds of responsibilities? I don’t think so. It may look promising given the perspective of having money to do whatever we want to do, but do I truly want to live that life? I’m not sure about it. When I was speaking about the open source factory it felt much better, because the involvement that I should have in that project is much less. I can only add my cents and get away with it. I don’t want to be mediocre here, I just want to have a balance in my life and with the work that I do that can help me enjoy most of the aspects of my life. And it feels like starting a startup is a train that already went by in my life. The same as being a soccer player. It already went by, and it is ok like that. Why dreaming so big if there still needs to be small steps to be taken? What is the purpose of those huge steps when I haven’t even been able to make 2 cents for the work I do? How can I dream about building a billion dollar company if I’m not able to earn 10 by offering my work to the world? Those are the questions that come to mind as I think about this, and more and more of myself is doubting that as a way of moving forward.

But anyway, it is still a way forward, and an important one that is happening right now. A lot of the innovation in the world is being driven by this kinds of systems, and it is important for me to acknowledge that. And it is also important to witness which are the elements in my life that I have given more energy to in the past years. How have I impacted the world? What have I given my energy to in this world on which I don’t have to work to earn a living? How does the answer to that question inform the way on which I place value in each element of my life? Definitely I have given a lot of energy to my self development. It is an addiction, a drug, and it makes sense to think that that is the place where I will be at. Finding others that want to walk that path, and helping them do it. And I’m doing that, what can I say, I have had 4 breathwork sessions and they have been very important. It is time for me to take that completely seriously and realize that I’m going to bring more and more of myself into that practice by learning better how to do it. And doing my own internal work. That is the thing. By doing this work I enable my own work to take place. I enable my own development and evolution. And that is the game that I’m playing, being in service for others. I always wanted to be in service. And sometimes I think that by having a company I will be in service for all the stakeholders of it. It will be the means by which I lead all those people into a particular way of being. But what if that is not the means by which I do it? What if there is another one? What if the most important service I can do to the world is not to frame myself into a particular way of being and I allow myself to be free? Because everything that I have done in the last pages has been building frames for myself, to limit what I do, what I can create, and so that people can identify me from somewhere. And it shows to me that there is a deep underlying need inside for being accepted, by sharing with the world a particular label of who I am. I am a writer, I am a programmer, I am this, I am that. They are all labels that define who I am, that categorize me, and that bring me into a position of not knowing who I am because I’m not any of those things. I’m just what is left when I’m not those things. I cannot label me. I just am. I’m just here, being a verb, exploring life from that perspective. I’m exploring what it means to be alive from the perspective of a human being, and that is all what it takes for me to be free. And I wont be free if I keep putting on top of me these labels, and the only way on which I can be free is by sharing myself enough so that other people put labels in myself. If I see this guy in social media, I have a particular label put on top of him that is built by my own understanding of who that person is, but it is not the truth of who he is. But in building my own label, I set him free of building one for himself. Is this real? I don’t even know, but what I know is that each time that I label myself I do some harm, I become more separated, because there is nothing that truly defines who I am. I seem to be a verb. I seem to be a particular expression of consciousness that is manifested through a person that has been all his life exploring, as joyful as he can, as deep as he can, what it means to be alive. I am just grateful. That’s what I am. Just grateful. I’m just grateful for the opportunity to be alive. Why don’t we take a breath together? Every time that I breathe is an opportunity to become more and more alive. To become more and more presence. To remember that at the end, what I am, is presence. Pure presence.

We have known it since the dawn of time: I am just another expression of who you are, having fun in this amazing adventure called time and space. That’s what I am. Another aspect of yourself. Imagining life through your eyes. Exploring what it means to be alive. Exploring what it means to be human. What it means to be polarized, to experience emotions. What a great information piece those things are: emotions. How amazing it is to be able to feel emotions. And they come in all shapes and sized, and that is the information that I use to better discover where my biases are. Where my wounds are. What are the emotional aspects of myself that have not been resolved, and that need to be worked on. That is what I’m working on. Discovering better and better who I am by interacting with people like you. That is the game that we are playing together here, and the one that I haven’t realized yet. I’m just here, being. Waiting for you to realize the same, that you are here, being. We are all just in this play, so sit back and enjoy what is going on. Allow yourself to not be identified by what you see, about what you experience, and realize that you are just awareness having an experience as a human being. That is where the true wisdom arises from, from the understanding that this is the infinite joke. The cosmic joke. The one that is being played and manifested, and explored. The infinite jest. That’s what it is. The infinite jest, and the more we explore it, the more we become what we came here to be. The more we become what we already are. That is the infinite jest. That is the game. The infinite game of just exploring what comes when there is nothing left to explore, because everything that will ever be already is. I’m just talking nonsense now, exploring how it feels to be ridiculous. To try to express something of which there is no clear understanding inside me. Of trying to point myself and you towards a truth that hasn’t been realized inside myself. There is an understanding that that truth is somewhere inside, but there isn’t an understanding of where it is. And that is the maze where I’ve been all this time, because life has given me the opportunity to be lost inside this maze. I’m just running an running around, exploring how it feels to be lost in the maze of my own mind.

What happens when I give myself the time to just sit down and write what comes? What if I start offering me this time as something sacred because it is the means by which I can transform myself into more and more of that who I already am but I’m not able to see because of all the layers of labels that I’m putting in top of my experience, over and over? What if I allow myself to not do anything more than writing, and I start putting that label around my experience as a human being? What if I just start writing more and more an realize that in the future there will be opportunities for me if I do it enough? What is the value of that? It is not about the people that I will touch with my writing itself, it is about how it will transform me and what will come from that transformation. It is about becoming more of myself through the process of taking out what I’m not.

I’m not the labels that I define myself with. I am the freedom that is left when there are no labels. I have always struggled with labels, with belonging to somewhere specific. I mean, for the time that I’m part of it I thrive, but then there is a process on which I don’t feel identified with it anymore and I get on my way. I stop being sincere because there is a lot in me related to not wanting to part of anything. I go somewhere and then I end up making friends and stuff and as soon as it is over I become less identified with it and it is just not part of me anymore. I mean, it is part of me, I integrate it, but I move on from there. That’s another expression of how I haven’t been able to be part of anything until now with my whole self, because I belong everywhere. I can be everywhere. And because of that, isn’t it that I am nowhere? Is that an expression of what comes when you try to be everywhere and you end up being nowhere? I wonder…

Because in all this belonging I build up those friendships and then I am forgotten. But am I truly forgotten? Or is the mark that I leave in people deeper than what they can forgive? Which is the mark that I leave in people? Which is that mark that is expressed as the image that they have of myself? And how responsible I am for that image? That is the game of life that is being played all the time, the one of the labels that we define others for. How can I help others to put a label on me if I’m not even able to do it for myself? Maybe it is that it is not my mission. It is the one of others. Maybe I just need to explore which is the image that others have of myself, and through that exploration, just be more and more of myself so that they can… I don’t know where I am going with this ‘so that they can’. What do I even care about what they think? Why am I basing who I am because of the interaction that I have with others? I have always thought about me as that. As the one that makes other people happy. As the one that brings about a smile. That has been my mission in the gatherings of people. Be the different one. I’m always forcing myself to be the different one, and always doing something different so that I can shine through that. That has been my mission now, and it is in that exploration that I have went deeper and deeper. Deeper into what? Into the maze. And how does this maze inform and help the work that I can do with other people? Which is the work that I do with other people? Is it truly that I need to come here and write for 4 hours straight or I can just give me the permission to write less time and be more efficient with it. Because until now I have been writing all this time today, and what is the consequence of it? What is present at the other side? Do I even know? I’m not doing it to have a particular consequence, I’m just doing it to find an expression for myself. There has been in me a big necessity related to being heard, to be able to share my voice, and until now I haven’t been able to be with that necessity enough so that I can refine my message and I can spread it in a way that can resonate with other people. And what happens when that happens? Where is that resonance in my interaction with others? How can I become more of myself because of my interaction with others? That is the question.

And what comes as an answer is just by witnessing who I am as I go through that interaction. What does it bring into myself? How do I react to it? Which is my truth because of it? Who am I at the other side of it? Always remember: At the other side there is another expression of consciousness being manifested as a human being that is the same as you. At the ground of existence, there is no difference between you and her, and that is the basics for the development of a healthy relationship. I am the same as that person. My truth is the same as hers, and it is just this mirage that we are living with as an interface that won’t allow me to see that truth. But if I’m able to pierce my experience of reality with this understanding, I will become more and more free of the consequences of it. I will dissolve myself into just beingness, which is being manifested right here, right now, as I write these words. As I become more and more of myself through the writing of these words. This is everything that I am, and the more I allow myself to be, the more I am. The less shoulds, the more are’s. You just are. I just am. That’s the game. Sit back and enjoy.

Enjoy the ride, and everything that comes with it. Every character that just wants to be noticed, every character just wants to be loved.
