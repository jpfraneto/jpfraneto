Today is one of those days on which I could feel bad because I did not do what I ‘should’ have done: Come here and write. But I did something that was as important as that, went to an amazing hike having eaten an amazing mushroom and then dove into an amazing iced lake on which I felt the truth of being a human being: I can’t fool nature. It knows. The knowledge is within. The step forward is through. Through what being an animal is.

It was an amazing day, I did not come and write, and it is perfect like this.
