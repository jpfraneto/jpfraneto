Here I am, dear world, back again Doing The Work. 
Here I am, dear world, showing up once more.
Here I am, dear world, without any hope.
Here I am, dear world, being me, just with all I’ve got.

I love writing poetry, and I’ve written a lot. A big part of me feels that all the writing that I do here in English is just the means by which I make all the space that is needed inside me so that the poetry can flow out, which I write in Spanish. So I vomit all these words in English so that later I can just sit down and write a small poem every day, which is the distillation of myself into something concise, that can touch hearts. I really don’t know how to write poetry yet, but it doesn’t truly matter because it is just me being me. There is no need to do it right. I just do it. The same as the writing here, there is no need for doing it right, there is just a deep need for doing it. For bringing it out. So here I am, just bringing it out, with all I’ve got. This is my truth, I come here to share it with myself, to be the witness of how it comes out. 

It all boils down to that, to learn how to be the witness of myself. Just be there exploring how it feels to be me, and how to become less and less identified with what I experience. I guess that a big heartbreaking thing in this journey of becoming less identified with myself is the fact that I will miss this shit. It is crazy to think that in some way everything that has happened in my life (and in yours too, for that matter), will be dissolved into nothingness. All those moments of which I’m the only witness are deeply embedded in the way I experience the world, and eventually, they will be dissolved into the void. Or not? The whole exploration that is taking place here with this writing is a deeper understanding of the consequences that I have in the world, what I bring into it by just being built by everything that I have gone through. All what I am in this moment, all what I do, every word and action that comes out of myself is a consequence of what I have been before. Of everything that I have seen, of everything that I’ve gone through. It all informs the way on which I explore the world, right here, right now, and in that sense it won’t ever go away. It won’t be dissolved, because it is being used as the fuel that generates this moment. And all the ones that come. It is the easiest thing to think that it will be dissolved, but I really don’t think that now. That’s why every single moment matters, because the consequences of it inform each future that end up being a reality. And that is the magic. That is the wealth of learning to live in the present moment. Of making that decision. Remember always: Living in the moment is a decision. It is something that you realize is good for you, and you decide to do it more and more. Until the point where it is an unconscious decision, where you exposed yourself so much to the thing that it is just part of the way on which you interface with reality. But until then, it is something that you have to think of, and do it more and more. Each time that you can. Each moment that you are reminded of it. What works as the means for that?

Always the breath. Every single time that you remember that you are breathing, try to slow your breath down. Try to bring your awareness into how it flows in and out, so that you can govern your experience of reality using the breath as the anchor of the present moment. That is the way on which you will be able to bring more and more presence into your being. Always remembering that you are breathing. Another one that helps me a lot is realizing the ways on which my body holds tension. And there is one particular moment on which that is expressed in me and I always learn, and it is when I’m standing peeing. Every time I’m doing that and I remember, I realize that there is tension in my shoulders. So I just try to relax that, and everything gets better. It is easy to relax, once you recognize that there is tension. 

Another good way of recognizing that tension is taking cold showers. There hasn’t been anything in my experience as powerful for this as the cold. Each time that I go in and I realize that my breath is moved in any way, I remind myself to slow it down, and this brings a deep awareness into the way I relate to my own body. I learn a lot through that process. Try it out, it is amazing.

The third one that comes to mind right now is practicing breathwork. When I do breath holds without air inside, it is easier to recognize the tension that is present in my body, And I just let it free. Ah, and when you are doing the active breaths to reach this point, just use each exhalation as a means for remembering to let go. This is also an incredible tool to learn more and more clearly how to go through this process of letting go. Let go of everything that is not useful anymore. Let go of everything that is not helping you be more of yourself. That’s the beauty of this whole thing, and these techniques are very helpful for developing that deeper capacity for being present. But first you’ve got to do the work, and all this things are tools that can bring you more towards that state. 

And also now that I’m writing this I realize that the creative act is another tool. In some moments of my writing I realize that there is tension present in my shoulders, or that I was not being aware of my breathing, and I just connect with it and continue. It is easy to think that I will use all the bandwidth that I have available if I’m taking care of all this things and I won’t be able to just write with all that in mind, but it doesn’t work like that. It is not that being aware of the breath takes bandwidth.
