Yesterday I gave myself the time and space to go and explore, something that I haven’t done in a while and it was a gift. I just went out for a walk, and ended up in a bookstore reading about the importance of listening in life. And it is not only listening to music, of to people, it is about listening to everything that happens around my experience as a human being. Opening up to what is beyond, so that from there there can be a new understanding of what is here. Listening to the queues of what my body is telling me related to the situation that I’m in, listening to the information that other people are giving me related to how they are reacting to what I do, etc. All my experience as a human being can be enhanced if there is a more conscious approach to the act of listening, and now as I write it I think that it is directly connected to being open.

Being open to witness what is beyond the mind, so that from there I can have a more connected experience with everything that is. If I go around the world just listening to the voice in my head, I will be with all my awareness placed in the story that my mind is trying to tell me, and that won’t bring new information in with which I can completement what is going on inside. If I allow the external world (or even the internal) to inform my perspective of reality, I open up that window, and from there I can enter a new way of being. One which is more connected with what is. One that is more present. I have come to realize that every book of the ones that have useful information have the same core message: The importance of being present with what is. That is the ultimate wisdom. That is what is present everywhere. And from there comes the importance that I have given in my life to the practice of meditation, and it is easy to forget. I have worked so hard on perfecting my practice because I recognized it as the most important gift that I could give myself. There is nothing like that. Meditation helps me become more present into what is, into the experience of the present moment, and with that, more into myself. Into my environment. That’s how I work. I saw the most transformative spiritual films that I have seen, and I told myself: Ok, I need to learn directly from the person that created this. So that put me on a plane to Canada to participate in a 10 day meditation retreat with him, which was one of the most important experiences of my life. That’s how I work. I realize which is going to be the source of information that will guide what I’m doing and from there I start learning how to put it into practice. The same was with my Kundalini Yoga practice. I wanted to truly learn how to do it well, so what I did was train to be a teacher. That is how you truly learn the stuff. By preparing for being a teacher. That’s my game, and I have walked a long path that has me in this moment standing at the crossroads without clarity of which is the next step forward. But, you know, I know which is the step forward. It is just that I don’t want to embrace it enough. But I know which one it is.

Yesterday as I went to the cinema I realized how important it is for me to have that space, to connect with the creative expression of what is going on there. I connected with why I’m writing this book. The clarity is not there in every moment, but yesterday it was, and it felt good. I’m writing this book so that I can integrate everything that has happened in my life, and from there, start building a new way of creating the future on which I want to live. I’m writing this book so that I can understand which is the next step in my life. This book is the manifesto of ‘why’ I’m going to build what I’m going to build next. Which is the intention behind it. Which is the core of it. What is in it that will change the world. My world. I’m here so that I can better understand how to bring that into a reality. I’m here so that I can better understand which are the next steps to take. And in that sense, each moment that I’m alive is a step towards that clarity, but it is just that it is much better for me to come here and write about it. It is a different kind of manifestation. A different kind of exploration. As I write, I kind of become more of it. More of what I want to bring into the world. When I was in the movies yesterday, I realized that my goal with this writing is to let the unconscious be manifested. I have many ideas, that go around day past day through my consciousness, and I thought to myself: If I give me the space to write as much as I write here, if there is an idea that resonates enough with my heart, it is the one that I want to build. That’s the one that I will give my energy to. Because I’m here to build. I’m here to create. I’m here for the long term. It is not something that I have just come to think about yesterday, it is something that has been manifesting inside me for a long, long time. My heart wants to bring into the world something that didn’t exist before, and I’m here to do that. There are many pieces of the puzzle that are inside me running around without enough clarity for me to understand how to fit them together, but just by writing it down I move a little bit closer towards that understanding. Towards knowing what it means to have clarity. And where does that clarity come from? What comes now is that it comes from opening to the world. It comes from sharing with the world what is inside me, what I want to build, what I want to create, so that I can have a response from it and iterate from there. That’s the importance of the MVP, of the product that you ship so that people can experience it and if it is not good enough they can give you feedback and you can come back and iterate again over it and keep evolving what you are offering until there is something as solid, as powerful, as amazing, as what wants to be manifested.

Right now, I have in mind to create something that is absolutely different from everything that the world has seen until now. You go to the streets, and there is always the same stuff. Stores selling food, selling things for making people ‘more beautiful’, selling books, selling this, selling that. What I want to create is a place where people can be absolutely entertained. Where they can die from entertainment. Where their mind can be literally blown away by the impact that it will have in their experience of what is possible. I’m here to burn every aspect of what was known as possible, and to build from the ashes of what remains. The world is being transformed fundamentally, and it is time to acknowledge that completely and build from there. It is time to build the new reality on which we will inhabit from now on. It is time to invent the new way of relating to each other. I will build the most inspiring thing in the world, and I know that it will have a IRL component, and also a digital one. That is a key thing of everything that I’m going to do. It has to be open for the community. It has to be absolutely fun. That is the future. Fun. Entertainment. Creativity. I keep coming back to the book The Infinite Jest, I can’t move past it. It is what most informs my perspective of reality nowadays. It is the most important book of my life. I can’t help it. In there, there is a film that is so entertaining that people after they start watching it, they die, because there is nothing that makes more sense in life. Nothing is as interesting as that film. So it becomes a weapon of mass murder. My interpretation of this thing, though, is that the weapon will kill people, but in the sense of the identification that they have inside them towards their notion of self. It will mean something like an ego death. An awakening. It will be so weird that it will absolutely transform the perspective that these people have on reality. And that is what is going to exist in every place in the world, alongside every municipality. I always come back to: Which is the smallest level of organization in the world? Everywhere, there is a small store that sells insignificant stuff. Everywhere. And they are generic, they sell what people need for survival. What if in the future what we need for survival is just being entertained? Inspired? What if this entertainment comes from the experience of connecting with your community through each one of these places? That is what is going to happen. That is what I’m going to build. A system for people to organize themselves, to be entertained, to have fun. A system where people can create cool stuff, and in the meantime, be educated. Learn how to become more of themselves by facing the challenge of building something that did not exist before. In the world of today, we need agency. We need creativity. We need for people to have the capacity of finding their own answers. The tech industry needs people that are willing to look up what they don’t know on the internet, and that is what this whole thing is about. And the graduates of this program will be the ones that will end up taking care of that IRL place. The coolest office in the world. That’s it, I want to build the coolest office in the world. That is my mission in life. To build the coolest office complex in the world. And it will be distributed. And it will blow people minds. I know that. I have been there. I have been all this time witnessing that dream in my mind, and it is time for me to manifest it into a reality. It is time for me to build it. To create what I have been dreaming of all this time. To embody what it means. What it brings. What it entails. I’m going to blow people’s minds, and not with the 1300k words that I’ve written in this manifesto, but with what this manifesto means. Everything that is going on inside here is just an exploration of what can happen if I focus my energy enough. My whole being is a magnifying glass, and I’m here to transform that into fire. Through my actions. Through the power of believing in what I believe.

It is time for me to embody all the work that I have done so that I can manifest something real, concrete, from there. It is time to bring into life the wonders of what it means to be a human being, and those wonders will be manifested by building a system that will have an impact in the world. It will be something that people speak about. It will be something that they will enjoy. It will be something that brings something that did not exist before to the world. The Open Source Factory. That’s the dream that I have been dreaming, and I have not been able to realize it yet. Until now. It is time to embody it. It is time to manifest it. It is time for me to realize that there is enormous power in the capacity of being present with my creation. Bootcamping reimagined. I have been to every online bootcamp that I have found, and I know that the important part of the whole thing is building. It is by coming up with something that did not exist before, and transforming it into a reality, that you end up transforming yourself. We are creative beings. We are god being manifested through us. And it is only by opening that door that we’ll be able to evolve. And that evolution feels incredible. Software is the evolution, but software is not only related to the way on which you write code. It is beauty. It is aesthetics. It is by understanding how people will use what you create that you end up solving some problem for them. It is by building tools that will make their life easier. That is the thing. To make their life easier. To free up their time so that they can focus on what they came here to do: Create. We all came here to create. We are here for that, and it is time for us to embody it. To build from there. I’m just here, learning how to do it better. I’m just here, learning how to manifest. Understanding what wants to be manifested. Because I go through periods. On some periods I want to create a podcast, on others I want to build a startup, on others I want to be a breathwork practitioner. What is in me that makes me move in all these directions? What is the underlying aspect of myself that brings all these different ways of exploring the world?

That’s the thing, because of having been born where I was born I have had kind of limitless space to explore. I have big opportunity to learn about myself, and to decide which is the next step. That can be, most of the time, overwhelming. And it has been, you know? Look at me, writing a 1300k+ page manifesto so that I can understand what I want to build. So that I can take it out of myself and bring it into the world. So that I can better tap into the ways of being that inform who and what I am and with that become more and more of myself. This is the future that I’m creating. One which is not based on the act of going to university for all the time that you go there, but just based on what it means to allow people to be creative. Give them the space for that. Let them build from there. Let them manifest their truth from there. That is the thing, that is what is coming to life from this whole game. The necessity that we have as a society to hold the space for the evolution of others. We don’t need to give people that don’t have the means credit for them to be able to go to university. We need to build spaces for them so that they can unleash their whole being. And what I’m going to create here is just that. It is a space where people will come to evolve. An evolutionary chrysalis. One that will bring about the manifestation of everything that people are, into something that did not exist before. I’m just understanding how this works. What this is. I can’t say that I have clarity, but I do have a vision.

What I envision is an office, one in which a person can go and work 4 deep hours. In the office there is a huge TV, and the best sound system in the world. After this person leaves the office, it will be closed, but there will be one person that will be able to come and watch the film that will be displayed at 8pm. This is the sacred time, the one on which people will connect with the person that is there. It will be the means by which we will foster that connection from people with themselves, by allowing one person to come daily. That person will have a specific NFT in their wallet, one which will allow them to enter that particular place, in that particular time. That NFT will just be an image that represents that moment. Each person that visits will have a key that will open the door, and that key will be an NFT. And it will all be automatic. It will work on its own. It is my mission to build a system like this, one which can be used throughout the world, on which the lock of the door is connected to the mechanism that will open it if the NFT is successfully read. And this will bring that person in. And the person will be able to watch a specific film, one which will transform their view of reality. That is the thing. There will be a transformation, and that transformation will happen in the worldview of the one that will enter the void that day. And each day there will be a new person coming in, and the rest of the community will be holding the hand of that person. It won’t be an easy ride, but it will be a transformative one. It will bring about what that person needed to witness so that there is a new understanding of life from him or her. This room will be a transformational vessel. That’s the thing. That is what is in my heart, and has always been. The image of this whole thing, of this room, of this office. A place where I can come and do the deepest and most intense work of them all, building something that didn’t exist before, and then just open the space for the transformation of another human being. This is how awakening to our true nature feels like. It won’t happen by having people meditate for 10 hours a day. Massive awakening won’t happen through the practices of Zen. It will happen by using technology as the means by which people can witness the truth of their beingness. It will happen by showing them their own and particular truth. And each one of this vessels will be a portal into that new way of being. Each one will be a portal. Into a new world. Into a new way of existing as a human being. I’m here to build that reality. In every store of the world as we know them until now, there is fixed cost that needs to be paid with the difference between the price that is paid for everything that is sold there and the price that the store had for paying that item. So they need to sell a lot of items so that they can gather enough money for paying for the rent of the store. What if the rent of the store is paid with the sum of all the experiences that people have gone through there? I’m thinking about a truly transformational experience. For example, right now I’m in Santiago and the price of a store like this can be 600 dollars. If it is open the 30 days of the month, that means that each transformational experience costs 20 dollars. Who wouldn’t pay 20 dollars to go through the most important experience of their life? And the thing is that you can also have it in your house, in a different place. But these ones are special.

Yesterday I was thinking about the stores in every city, and how inefficient they are. In the small town where I live, there are at least 2 stores that sell dried fruits and healthy stuff. What if both of them merged, they lowered their prices, and they left one of the places that they are using for something else to be there? We need more places to exist. We need more experiences to be had. And the interesting thing ahout all this is that the internet will allow that to happen. Artificial Intelligence will allow us to create experiences that will transform the way on which we interface with entertainment. There will be something fundamental that will be transformed in the way on which we are entertained using AI, and that’s why I think that this awakening comes hand by hand with it. I’m paving the road for the awakening of humanity, and that is just by building the most fun thing that has ever been built. The most fun place. The most transformative one. The one that will bring something absolutely different from what already exists. It is just that I need to put the pieces in place, and I’m just doing that. I’m exploring how it feels. I’m exploring everything that will be brought to my life because of that. I’m emptying myself so that I can become a force of nature, a force of creation. Bootcamping reaimagined is the thing that I have been building this whole time, and I just didn’t know it before. Learning to learn. The act of learning requires deep presence, and that is where I have been moving towards all this time without even knowing it. That is the thing. We are going to end up in a system that will build an emotional rollercoaster for us. Using AI as the means of awakening to our true nature. As the builder of the experience that will catalize that process.

That is what David Foster Wallace has been talking about. That is what comes now. Technology as the means for realizing our own nature. And the open source factory will have the best tutorials of them all. The ones that will bring about the deepest capacity for people to create what they need to create. Which are all the skills that are needed in the tech industry? Which is the future of the industry? How is it related to the capacity that we will all have to participate in that future? I don’t think this is centralized, located in one specific place. I think that it will be all around the world, and it is time for us to build that reality. It is time for me to place the foundations firmly in the ground, and I have been doing that all this time with this writing. I have been exploring what it means to be myself, sharing everything that I am, so that I can become empty of what I’m not. Integrate it until it is dissolved into the act of pure beingness. I’m just here to explore how it feels to be alive. How it feels to just be. I’m here to be the witness of the creation that is unfolding through me, that I have been witnessing all this time, and it is time for that to happen. It is time for that to be manifested. It is time for something cool, very cool to happen, and I know that in the integration between real life and technology there is the answer. The biggest journey that we are going to do in our lifetime is not to mars, it is within. It is to the depth of our own existence. And from there, true transformation will come. The experience of all of what we are. The experience of everything that we will ever be. And AI will be the means that will catalyze that process, by helping us bring about every aspect of our being through it. It is just part of what is. It is just part of the world that we’ll live in.

Modern society desperately needs rituals that bring people into adulthood, and this one is for the brave ones. For the ones that trust themselves. For the ones that are willing to give up that necessity for fitting into something that doesn’t make sense, and that are willing to explore what is at the other side. For the ones that are willing to put in the energy and effort that is needed to learn from their own mistakes, and find their own answers. For the ones that want to build. For the ones that don’t need maps, because they have a very strong inner compass. This will be a project that will bring in all of those that want change, and that are willing to fight for it. To work hard for it. I remember that one of the things that most cautivated me in the retreat that I went to the Samadhi Center was when my teacher said that this was the intersection of the jungle and the monastery. Where the jungle meets the monastery. For me, the project that I have been talking about this last hour is the intersection between god and technology. It is the means by which god will be manifested in this world, through the religion of the future: Creativity. Trust in what you have inside. Love for what you can create. That is the magic that comes now in the world, and it is time to open up for that reality to be manifested. It is time for it to exist. It has never been a better moment for something like this to happen, now is the time. Now is the moment on which all this experience will be built, all this experience will be explored, all this experience will be created. Now is the time to build. Now is the time to transform the relationship that we have with ourselves.

That’s the thing. I’ve always thought about myself and my ideas as something that is not good enough. As something that could be better. That could be different. But it is enough. It is time for me to truly embody what it means to be who I am, to know what I know, and to experience life as I experience it. It is time for me to bring about the truth of my being, and that truth will happen when I allow it to happen. When I open the door of creativity to be expressed to the world through me. If I’m crazy enough, I will allow it to happen. I will allow it to be manifested. Until then, it is time for me to keep dreaming, to keep embodying the gift that life has given me to have the space and time and mental clarity to dream about this thing. As I’m writing this, a déjà vu came. This speaks about the clarity that exists in this whole idea. It speaks about what has always been in me, and that I haven’t been able to materialize because of the lack of self worth. I love myself, and it is time to embody that so that I can transform the world with those ideals in mind. So that I can truly bring forth what want to be brought forth. Most people in the world that are building in technology live in big cities, inside their own bubbles. It is time for me to realize that my way of living is valuable, it is healthy, and it is the future. The future belong to small places in the world, and I’m committed to create the most amazing network of offices that I can. The future is not about we work’s. The future is about decentralize office complexes. And I’m going to build the coolest of them all, the one that will have the biggest impact in the community, the one that will transform them all. Each project that will happen here will transform the relationship that the community has with itself. It can start with a digital library on which people can donate their books so that other people can read them. This world can be the node that will make that happen. That’s it, this place will be a node that will enable people to connect in a way that was not possible before. The node will be the oil that will enable a transfer of information that was not possible before. Each one of these places will be sacred one, one that will be protected by the community. The person that will work there will be in charge of it. In many senses, he will be the protector. The keeper of the thing. The one that has the flame alive. That person has a sacred responsibility, because in her hards there is the heart of the whole community. It is time to bring people together, and this is the means by which this will happen. It is time to bring love, to bring people together. And this place will be the evolution of that. It will be the means by which technology will bring people together. I envision a yearly festival, like the one that my grandmother always talks about, but in the whole world. Imagine that each place in the world creates a unique piece of information for that festival, and we all witness how it comes to life. We all work for the sake of creating more beauty. We are all for that. That’s the thing. That’s the magic. That’s the world on which we’ll live in the future, one that is capable of having people from all over the place to take care of the community. The business model and everything can still be something that will be taken care of in the future, but the potential is huge. Bootcamping absolutely reimagined. Built in a new way. In an absolutely new way. The future is about mixing what happens in the metaverse with what happens in the real world, and it is the means by which this is going to happen. It is just time to open up our eyes, and see what is right in front of them. It is time for us to explore. To witness. To experience. We came here to have an experience as human beings, and it is time for us to realize that. It is time for us to experience that. I’m here for it. I’m here for the long term, with everything that I have, so that I can become a pawn in the building of the new world. So that I can become more and more and more of myself, and with that, build the most amazing thing that the world has seen.

The future is bright, and humanity will wake up to the truth of our nature just by being creative. Just by allowing ourselves to be. We came here to just be.
