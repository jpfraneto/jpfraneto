This whole game that I have been describing through my writing is very related to the word truth. To bring about the truth of your being into your awareness, so that from there you can be free. And a big element of the human experience that is present right now for me is the capacity, or the tendency, or whatever it is for us to not trust in ourselves enough so that we can share our voice, the unique thing that we bring. It is so easy to hide ourselves behind the willingness to do something good, but not be able to open up to share it because your truth feels weird It doesn’t feel what people have been used to hear from you, so it feels weird to do it. It is always that voice inside the head that is telling yo that the work is not good enough, that you are not worthy of attention from those who want to listen. And this game of awakening is waking up to that truth also, to the truth that it doesn’t really matter, because the creative process itself is not dependent on what people think directly. You do your thing, and then you share it. There may be an aspect of feedback that transforms what you are doing as you are doing it (I’m taking right now about a musician on stage that decides to do something different because of the crowd giving some particular feedback about it), but in that case, the feedback is being used constructively for the artist to evolve what she is doing. It is food for the creation that is taking oplace, not something that pushes it down. And that is where I’m trying to get at here, that food for creation can be sometimes constructive or descrutctive, depending on the way on which the artist receives it. And the more connected you are to the source, the less damage this feedback does to you in a destructive way, because you create from a place different than that which worries about people not being happy with what you do. That is part of the game of awakening the truth, to your truth…. Realizing the game of creativity and how it is played, as you become more and more free of the conditioning that you have to please the people that you create for.

Who do you create for in the first place? That is the question that should be asked. Who is the receptor of your creation? What comes to mind right now is the story about Vincent Van Gogh (or a painter like that), who sold just 1 painting throughout his life in the equivalent of 16 euros of now, and then lately died because of a disease without knowing anything about the success that he will have later. But he was true, he was doing his thing for something more than fame or fortune. He was doing it from a deep place of within, which enabled him to have a particular artistic expression that was unique to who he was. Perhaps his unique expression was not related to selling his paintings, or becoming famous in any way, but it is like that, he was able to find means to express it in a different way, and his mark is there. Was he worse because he didn’t have the recognition of the public, feedback, when he was alive? No, not at all. He created something so unique, so perfectly his, that he was recognized by it afterwards, and his ego did not become attached to what he was creating in the sense that it would if he new that people were paying attention.

That is something very interesting about this internet age, how in many cases the important thing is the ideas that are behind the person, more than the person itself. It you are able to convey something that appeals to people and resonates with them, there is no need for you to be you. The internet doesn’t care about that. That whole structure of who you have been is that, a construct, which does not need to be in place for this game to be played. At the end, what do you want people to recognize you for? Do you even want to be recognized r you just want to enjoy life? I put the word or in there, as if they were not complementary concepts. Of course you can be recognized and enjoy life, but I have the feeling that there will always be this small aspect of ego that will not leave you alone. And if you create stuff without labelling it with your name there is a particular kind of freedom, that I, myself, as not experienced completely. Maybe it is time to play the game and start building from there, to see what comes up. To explore the game a little bit and realize how fun it can be to have no name. On having no head. On having no name.

And then we get into the difference of a person that has no name and a bot in Twitter for example. How could you tell the difference in the long run of someone that has no name, no personal identity attached and a bot? Is it even a good thing to have no name? What is the relationship of having no name in social media and publishing from that place and awakening to your true nature? All these things are coming from the mind, there is an eternal need inside there that wants to know, that wants to better understand the consequence of what it does so that it can control better the outcomes. And that is the eternal game of the ‘what could happen if…?’. There is no way out of that game, because there is a fundamental impossibility of knowing if action is not taken. The only way to know is to take action, is to do the thing. It is to bring it out from the mind and into the world, which is another aspect of mind, but one that is shared. There his the internal aspect of the mind that is the one that goes running and running in circles inside the head, inside myself, and then there is the collective aspect of mind that is where we all are. It is the place where what I do interacts with what you have done and from there both of us evolve in our particular ways into something different that can be completely different from what was happening inside the mind of each of the participants and the movie that was being played inside there. Kopfikno. That is the word. The cinema of the mind. That word has always stuck with me, because it is so true. The mind is always playing a story that s related to its conditioning, to what has gone throughout its life, and from there it is able to try and predict what will happen in the future. We are the best predicting the future, but the worse predictors. Which is the idea of predicting the future? Yes, of course that planning is one of those things, but is it that important to pan? That is something that I wonder a lot, because my father is the best planner of them all. Everything is measured and planned, and it is something that of course has worked for him in his life, but I really wonder if it is something that is condiment to the expression of the soul.

To the truth.

How is planning connected to the truth? I plan to sit down and meditate, and I plan that I won’t get up for one hour, until that bell rings. And it ends up being interesting, because from that planning all what arises in the meditation is a consequence of that, and I learn a lot of myself in that process, and I evolve my practice by learning a little more about how to be equanimous, in a energetically and biological way. So that planning is helpful, because I’m able to carve out some time to sit down and just be, so that I can better feel how it feels to be, and bring it about in all my other interactions. That is cool, you know. TO ´be here, writing all this without too much sense, and finding out stories and conclusions about wmyself, about how I relate to reality, about what is important in this game.

I feel now that the best way to do this is by creating an avatar that doesn0t have name, with the story that I wanted to tell about it hidden insid. But I don’t know how to tell stories other than that of myself, so it will be similar to my story. To my quest. I want to share my story beca´use this is how it feels to be a perpetual seeker, to be involved with Dukkha at the bottom of your toes. There is nothing that is enough, and I want to break free. But I even doubt if this is my ego that wants to evolve spiritually, and then go and create stuff under this ego so that the image that the world has of itself is different and cooler. Do I really want the image of myself to be cooler or this is just an exploration into what I want to create? The good thing about creating this whole thing under the image of a creation that doesn’t exist in reality (that whole thing is another creation of the mind, because if this character is built through the internet, and it doesn’t have a human being attached on its name, isn’t it true? Isn’t it real? Of course it is real. And of course that it has a human character attached in its back. I will be there, pulling the strings, until there are no boundaries and the strings become me. Until the hands merge with what is being pulled, and from there, stuff starts happening. It is nice to hide behind my face and hide behind the fact that I say that I’m being truthful with my truth, but is is hard to give up the identification of that truth with me. That is the step that I feel that needs to be taken now, the full dissolving of my identity in the way that I speak about awakening. I need to become free from the attachment of my ego of ‘wanting to be awake’. That’s what Jed McKenna did with his book. He wrote it from a perspective of someone that is not actually present there, probably because of the consequence that writing that book would have on the perspective on which he saw himself, and other people saw himself also. There is beauty, there is value, on breaking free of the identification with what people think about you, and in creating from that place. Van Gogh created from a place of pure expression, and what remains from him is just his art. Nothing else matters. What he brought to the world is what stays, not who he was particularly. Who he was is translated into everything that he painted, and it that, he freed himself on having to realize who he was, because it was an eternal exploration through what he did. This is similar to just being. You are in the sense the you let yourself be. And the expression of that being ends up being the creation of stuff, just for the sake of it. That’s all of what I have been talking about today, about the consequences of creating just for the sake of it, without attachments to the consequences of that creation. My mother knitted socks, but those creations are fully conditioned to her ego because the only way on which she shares her work is by giving them out as a present, for free, so that people can use them and tell their friends that she was the one that made them. There is always an attachment there related to someone telling that you were the one that did something. What is that attachment is not related to my persona, but for a secondary character that I create in the world and who is in charge of doing something cool out there? I have been sharing consistently through Instagram this week breath work sessions, but it is getting to a point where I don’t know if it is helping me anymore. Of course it helps, because there is information that comes from the fact that I’m able to share my truth with the world, but, do I really need to do it? Is it a step into the transition of opening that is created when you are able to share your truth without wanting to change other people? That is part of my intention while doing what I’m doing there. Explore into the sensations that come. Share my truth. Share everything that I am now, so that people can better understand the point where I am at. Is it necessary? I feel it as doing the due diligence for people to better get me. Do I need to do it? The easier way would be to create for me an account not associated to my name, and create for there. Is that the way forward? I don’t really need to ask this questions to myself, I just need to do it and explore. There are ways on which this can be manifested, and I guess that it is time to do it.

Satoshi Nakamoto did his thing without the need of having to be recognized, and it must be freeing to have it done it that way. There must be true value on your name not being attached to your identity. Is that a correct way to put it? I don’t really know which is the relationship of identity and name, what is each of those concepts. I just use them because it feels that it is what needs to be said, but I’m not completely sure about what I’m saying. I’m just saying it. Then I will come back and review, but for now the most important thing for me is to just throw what is present away, report what is present and just be from there.

What is present now is a certain willingness in the body to sit down with the eyes closed and stare inside. This last weeks have been brutal in the sense that the internal energy is continuing to build up, and there doesn’t seem to be a stopping of this thing. I wonder when it will explode, because it keeps going up and u. And this here is like my valve of escape, the place on which I come to write about this whole process so that I can have something written for afterwards come and realize how crazy I am. I was. I will always be. I’m crazy and you are too, the thing is that I just acknowledge it. I don’t care pointing myself with the flashlight and saying that I’m crazy, because it doesn’t matter. What is it to be crazy, anyway, more than not meeting the expectations that people have of your behavior. That is being crazy, and there are so many crazy people out there that are not even able to realize it because they want to fit. Trying to fit is like putting your soul in a blender in maximum speed. Trying to fit is acknowledging that there is something in you that wants to be expressed but not having the guts to do it. Trying to fit is spending the precious life force that you have inside in the game of other different than yourself and the people with which you relate. Which is the boundary of the people with which you relate, nowadays, anyway? Is there a boundary? I can create my twitter account and the amount of people with which I relate can grow exponentially, because relating to someone is having an impact in their expression of consciousness, and as soon as I create a piece of content and someone interacts with it, I’m in. I made it. I’m relating to them, in a very deep way. That is the game we are playing here, that of relating to one another in ways that we don’t imagine, in ways that we don’t understand.

· · ·

What is this whole thing about? I’m going through that all the time, running around in my mind, realizing the road that I’m in. I don’t really understand. I don’t really know where I’m heading. I’m confused. In some moments it feels like I have complete clarity on the way that I’m doing progress, and on other moments there is no clarity at all. I don’t know where I’m going. But my heart knows. What if I left the doubts behind and I just pushed forward with it. Why do I need to run in circles without having feedback from the world? Isn’t having feedback the nice thing about this? Isn’t learning if it will be useful for someone the whole point of the thing? That’s how it is supposed to work nowadays. You create something, you wait for the feedback to come and then you evolve from there. But what if people don’t understand what you are doing? What happened to Van Gogh? If he had waited for the feedback from the people, where would he have ended? That is the thing. I can spend days searching blindly for feedback, or I just can go for it and bring about something from the depth of my soul. What do I prefer? To be sincere. I prefer to go for it, because that is the work that is being done here. It is about facing the demons with all of what I have. I tend to say that the open source factory was a waste of time, but it wasn’t. It trained me to what I’m doing now. It was the preparation stage for this game. It was what needed to happen before I got to where I am at now. To bringing about all this writing with the consistency and discipline that is needed to build something amazing. The important part is building something amazing. And this maze of words is amazing in and of itself. It is something that if no one comes to it, it doesn’t matter because it helped me to take out what I needed to take out of myself to evolve.

It is the ever asking of the prompt: Tell me who you are. TELL ME WHO YOU ARE. I yell at myself. Who the fuck are you! I want to know. I really want to know. Show me your real self, your real being. Show me the truth of who you are. Show me the truth of what is hidden behind all this thoughts, all these words, all these smiles to random people in the world, all this willingness to explore what it means to be alive, all these different creations that have come about in the last years, from polishing pieces of wood for people to paint on them to creating random websites to do the work. To show up and do the work. That is the thing, doing the work. That’s why I’m here, for doing the work. Until I don’t realize that, I won’t be free. It is time to be free. I will be free. The only way in is through, and in this case, through is into the work. Into every word that show up itself. Into every concept, every image, every process that shows up through these words. The information is all here. This is magic. It is so easy for me to think that it is easy to show up and write 7000 words in one day. It is no easy. It is so easy for me to think that it is easy to show up. It is not. Most people don’t show up because they don’t care enough. I care. I care more than more. Awareness is closer than close, and I care more than more. The world is fucked up, and it is time to wake up. It is time to Do The Work. You may ask, what is Doing The Work? It is showing up to stare at yourself deeply. It is using the tools that we will develop in the DAO as the means of exploring who you are as deep as you can.

The ancient yogis showed up within themselves and were able to explore their consciousness by developing techniques over and over again, for thousands of years. We don’t have that time right now, it is time for us to wake up. It is time for us to gather up forces as a collective and evolve together, helping each other in the process. It is time for us to develop the transformational journeys that will take us to the other side. Iterating. Learning from mistakes. Together. Developing a timetable of 21 days on which each day will have specific things to do, to Do The Work. DTW. It is almost like DFW, the one that kickstarted this whole thing for me. My mentor, and he didn’t know it. With his book The Infinite Jest, he kickstarted the whole thing. Now the letters are coming back. DTW is kind of the same than DFW and I didn’t realize that until now. Do The Work. David Foster Wallace. I’m going to make sure that your legacy is not wasted, David. We will find a way to treat and cure depression together. Now is the time. I’m creating a time machine on which more and more people will get in, and become transformed. Something huge is starting, and this is the beginning of it.

Do The Fucking Work. Maybe that’s what the F means. DTFW. David The Foster Wallace. Do The Fucking Work. It is time to do the work. Show up. What I’m creating is for you to realize that it is time to do the work. They all say it. They all mean it. It is is the pattern that is repeating itself over and over again, everywhere. I’m tired of looking at it from the distance, not realizing that I’ve got to do the work also. I also have to show up for myself, for my family, for all of those that will be part of this thing. For all the ones that will come next. I won’t be the main engineer of Space X, or developing the ultimate artificial intelligence for Tesla. Nope, that is not my thing. My thing is to help those incredible humans polish their mind as much as they can so that they can come up with the most amazing ideas. Each of the persons that is going to be part of the cohort can come with an idea, with something that they are working on, and the other guys will have to create together a solution for that thing. That is the whole game. The ultimate creativity, building something for each other, to help each other in their own game. That is what the internet is about, and it is important to realize the different personalities that every human being has so that something can be built having that in mind. Each person has something to add to the other, and in the opening to that possibility there is amazing wealth to be built.

    That is the game that is being played in here, by deepening the relationship that each person has with itself. We need to be more creative than ever, and the only way in is through. The only way into that creativity is by exploring deeper and deeper into who each human being is, so that the connection with the source can be established more clearly. With less interference. That is where the magic comes from, from that connection. From touching the alchemical gold and being transformed through that process. By showing up and building a space for people to do that, things will change. We will go through that together. In the Samadhi Center retreat, we had 2 periods of 2 hours of meditation. In this transformational journey, we will have 2 periods of 2 hours of deep creative work, from which our true nature will arise. How do you define deep creative work? That is a very good question, and it is ought to be explored in the future as this project gets more complex. The important thing now is to build cohort 1, which will be the one that will set up the tone for the whole thing. Which is the one that will start building the internet of the future, the way on which we relate to us and each other together. Something amazing will come up from here. It doesn’t matter if we are the only ones, we will be there pushing it forward. Exploring what happens from there. Life is an invitation into a constant iteration into what works and what doesn’t, that is how we learn. That is how nature evolves. Trial and error. Trial and error. We are here for that. That is where the fun is. Do The Work, makes mistakes and digest what happened so that you can evolve from there. There are no failures, only misinterpretations of what was valuable in the experience that you went through. It is all about perspective. Everything boils down to perspective. Realize that and be free of wanting things to be different from what they are. They are what they should be, they are as they should be, and they have always been. That is the magic of this whole thing, that each of us has at hand the means for dong their best. The means for realizing that everything is at its hand.

And I am the first one that needs to realize that, because I’m in charge of this project. It is my duty to build it as cool as I can, and if I keep pushing me down for not being enough I won’t end up anywhere. What do I need to have the trust in myself that is needed to use down? The understanding that resistance will always ne there. That’s what this guy speaks about in the book The War On Art. Steven Pressfield. He speaks about the restistance as that mighty enemy that won’t let you be free. It will never let you be free, so you’ve got to learn how to deal with it. It is part of being a human being. So the thing is to move forward with it and enjoy the ride. It is to push through that resistance and overcome it by just sitting own and do the work. Which is the important work that I’m doing right now? Just showing up and writing this. Trusting that it will bring about what I need so that I can evolve in this amazing world that we live in. Everything that I need is already here, I just need to trust it enough. Surrender and trust are about showing up and doing the work, and letting life do its thing. And its thing is whatever happens next, the important thing is to have the perspective in place so that I don’t feel that there is something against me. There is nothing against me. There I only a collection of experiences that is going on and is part of it, it will always be part of it, no matter what happens, so what I can do is just accept it as part of reality and move on from there. With trust. With love. The important thing is to do the work so that day after day I’m better able to love myself a little bit more. Only a little, that is all what is needed. Step by step. And there will be hard days, this thing is not easy. But always remember the resistance, and how it will always conspire agains our creative self because it wants to be sfe. And creating stuff is not safe, because you are exposing yourself. You are showing to the world what you are, everything that you are, and it can be brutal. It is crazy not to have walls built around your experience. It is crazy to be open. We are not used to it, but it is what it is. It is what needs to happen for us to evolve. Everything must be open, available, so that we can evolve from there. It is time to be transparent, as a wall of glass, so that the light can shine from deep within.

    My mission is to be there for all of those who are lost. For all of those who don’t see the way out. For all of those that are depressed and haven’t found help anywhere. For those who have realized by the use of psychedelics that there is a world within that they did not know it existed, and that want to go deeper into the exploration of that world. My mission is to kindle a light into the soul of this people, so that they can feel that they are not alone. This universe that is being built is a beehive on which each of us will be the bees that will bring the nectar of the soul into our queen, our beloved mother. It doesn’t matter if you hate your mother, there is an aspect within yourself that craves for connection to her, to the feminine, to Mother Earth. Call it as you wish, but that will be our queen in this beehive. And each of us will go and tap to the infinite source by Doing The Work. By being part of this collective, you will realize that you are not alone. Not by talking nonsense that will never get you anywhere as the best diet, or the best practices to get better sleep, or whatever. The mission of Dukkha is to help you realize that that information is already there, and you don’t need it in here. What you need is a place to connect with yourself, through the connection with others, and with that, be able to have better relationship with all of those aspects of your life that you want to put energy in. The less time you spend in the discord server, the better, because an important part of Doing The Work is realizing that The Work is done everywhere, all at once. In wherever situation you are in, there will always be an opportunity to do the work. So we come here and develop this intensive program so that we can better understand what we need to do to do the work, but it is nothing more than that. We practice the practices here within Dukkha so that the fog is lifted, so that we can go to our life without that fog and share with every situation all of who we are, all of who we have always been. Each 21 program will teach you how to lift up the fog. How to stay present. It will give you different tools for developing a relationship with yourself that will enable you to give your best in every situation. And then you will come back here to do it again. This is an ongoing process, and what is going to happen in each journey is just the starting point of it. What comes next is the work that you will do in every aspect of your life to recognize how that aspect is helping you to become more fogged, and then being able to recognize that you will get into the realization on how you need to act so that fog is not up again. It is an ongoing process of being a witness to the fog, and realizing that the fog is not you. You are what is behind the fog, what has always been there. No matter if your eyes are open or close, you are always there. That is the key realization, which will bring you to a state of non resistance, of flowing with things just as how they are. This non resistance will open up the avenues for your true self to express itself through every one of your actions, and this is what lifting the fog is all about. Realizing that you are much more than the fog, than those constant, pathological thoughts, and letting your creative genius free That is all what you need to evolve, to bring about your best work. TO shine. Lift the fog and you will shine. The sun is not reaching your inside because of the fog. Start being aware of your breathing and lift it up. It will feel amazing. It will feel more you the n ever. That is the cool part. Doing The Work feels amazing. It is a sensation of freedom that connects you with the core of your existence, and that is something that is foreign to you if you haven’t experienced before. If you hadn’t open that window before. But it is not about you, most of us have not been able to open that window, and that is why we are here, to help each other to become free of the window. To travel into another aspect of the being, which is based on a pure connection with all what is. Not what has been, or what will be, but just with what is. And that is the cool part about this thing, that there is nothing more here than what already is here, so there is actually nothing o be changed, more than your tendency for wanting things to be different. That is the only problem. Our lack of acceptance of how things truly are. As soon as you become free of that wanting to control that part of your life, the rest will take care of itself alone. It willl start resonating in a differen way, you will start resonating in a different way, and from there on there is no way back. It will be scary, it is fucking scary for me, right now as I write I feel very weird movements of energy throughout my body, mainly in weird areas of my brain, but I know tat I just need to push through it. To trust and know that everything will babe ok. But there is my primordial heart of ceasing to exist, of forgetting who I am, of learning my family behindnd. I know that all this fear is coming from the mind but, who am I? What is the mind? Are these words being written by the mind of by me? That is the question that goes through my mind a lot, and nob writing it down is an exploration into th answer by just pointing a torch into that aspect of myself that is always questioning and wanting to know. The mind wants to know. My mind wants to know it all. I want to indulge deeply into every conversation that Lex Fridman has had with the most amazing humans run the world, so that I can know more about this amazing experience called life. But I fucking can’t. It is impossible, at least now, so it is time to make peace with that fact and move on. I kind of feel that I have been able to make peace with that fact, but I’m not sure yet because it is coming up now. I guess that part of that existential fear is related to not being able to do everything that I would like in my lifetime. Being more with my family, writing more, reading more, listening to more music, more, more, more. Everything is more. Why do we always want more, and not less? When is the moment that the shift is made when the realization that comes is that less is more? That sounds unbelievably valuable, specially in this day and age. Less is more, believe it until the core of your being. If you want to indulge all day long into different content, have in mind than the biggest investment that you can do in your lifetime is realizing that less is more. Wisdom and happiness are in another place. Open your eyes.

Who am I talking to? I have realized that most of the time I’m talking to myself, because I realize that huge part of me that wants this to be over. That wants the seeking to be over. That’s why I talk to myself, because I know that someday someone will find value on reading all the struggle that I have gone through inside my own mind. You are not the only one, my friend, there are plenty of us that have gone through this whole process. You are not the only one. It is a natural part of being alive, it is the journey that we sign up for as we jump into the experience of becoming. And it is the mystery also. The magic. The way ahead. I’m paving the road for you to walk it afterwards. Or maybe paving is not the best analogy, maybe I’m just cutting through the noise with my machete. Cutting through all the noise of the mind, bringing it all out so that what remains is just stillness. Not more noise. Only stillness. The only way in is through, and I’m opening the path so that for you it is easier to go through. Establishing an environment through which you can walk and with that evolve into what you came here to be. And have always been. Opening the bushes, shattering the noise into thin air so that clarity can come forth. That is what is needed. The clarity of the pond not being moving because of incessant thoughts. The clarity that comes when there are no more thoughts, the clarity that comes when everything stops and time ceases to exist. That is what shows up when time ceases to exist. The timeless. The open void of non-movement. What remains when there is no more movement? Only you, but without the you. Just pure awareness. That which has always been bringing in reality through each of your senses.

Each sense of your body is a window into the world, an interface towards it, and it can’t be shut down. What can be shut down is your identification with that interface, so that you can realize that you are way beyond that. Closer than close. If I open my eyes, awareness is there, receiving what comes in from the senses. If I close my eyes, awareness is still there, receiving something different because the input signal is different. But it is still there. What does remain behind that? I always tend that awakening is ‘viewing’ in a different way, always associated with sight in any way. But there is a fundamental shift that will take place when I realize that awakening is not related to the sense of sight, nor it is related to the sense of hearing, or touching, or tasting, or smelling. It is beyond each of these inputs, it is beyond what theis interface brings into it. Each sense of the human body is just an input in the computer, but: What is behind the computer? Which is the operative system of this computer? I don’t even understand if that is a proper analogy, but I just say it to find any meaning in there to get a finer grasp of this thing. To be better able to explain it. But how can I explain it if I don’t really know what I’m talking about? What is going on in here? Just pure noise, the mind makings its appearance and trying to grasp into something to swhich it can’t really grasp, building up concepts and ways of explaining that which can’t be explained. Which is the goal of that? Continue with the game of division, of separation, from which it feeds itself. The mind is a machine that is fed by this game of separation, and as soon as I’m able to realize that more clearly I will move towards a better iuundefstanding of what it means to be free. I just want to be free. I want to break free. When I say that, who is the ‘I’ that is writing it? Who is the one that wants to break free? Is it the ego that is highly spiritualized and that wants to become something? Is it the mind that continues to believe that the way on which it will realize its true nature is by realizing that it is just a concept that does not have any solid existence? This whole game is a maze, and I’m deeply into the mazer, not really knowing how to get out. I guess that all these words are like the small crumbles of bread that I’m throwing at the floor as I go deeper and deeper into the maze,so that I can get out afterwards without becoming crazy. All these words are the means by which I help myself to get out after I realize that there is nothing that can be understood. I know that in a conceptual level, but a big part of me wants to know. Is that part getting bigger or smaller as I write these words? Is it becoming stronger or weaker? Is it more present or more absent?

I guess that a big gauge that can help answer those questions is what happens after all these writing sessions, as I go back to relate to the people with which I interact in a daily basis and become who I am by relating to them. There is a big feeling inside that there has been a strong evolution in that relationship, as I open more and more to accepting them for who they are. I go to my parents house and I’m more able to see them for who they are, realizing that they are not the patterns of action that trigger me, they are way beyond that. I go to my grandmothers house and open to the possibility of knowing her for who she is, more than what I want her to be. That is something that is becoming more present day after day: I’m starting to give up the control of wanting people to be different. Even myself. Sometimes I see myself doing things that make me judge me afterwards, and then I realize that it is all a game. It is all the game of the mind, trying to make sense of something that can’t be made sense. And then comes the freedom from that, and a good laughter. A cosmic laughter, that comes from the cosmic joke. The joke of the mental universe, on which I’m always trying to make sense. Always wanting to know. The mind wants to know. I’m the perfect example of that. Perhaps we are all the best example of that, it is just that I have played the game so deeply that I’m very aware about it. And it gets hilarious. The games that the mind play are hilarious. It is time to realize that I’m not those games, and just have fun playing them. Release the inner child that has been with me all my life, and be free from wanting to be someone. Be able to be. Be able to witness who I am with all my deficiencies and just enjoy. With the complexities of what the mind has built, of this whole maze that I have built for myself.

Imagine, instead of being just a normal dude working some wood and having a chilled experience, I’m doing my best to build up this DAO (whatever a DAO is) and connect people from all over the world with the intention to awaken the human race. Why couldn’t I be just a normal dude that want’s to do his thing in silence? I can’t. There is a deep need in me related to complexity, to bringing up something more than what is there. And I can’t rest on the feeling of not trying my best to do it. Maybe the next lifetime I will be able to rest a bit more. I don’t know. But for now, it is time to buidl, to create something cool, and to transform the world into something different. I will do my best to understand that there is no need to transform anything, but I do want to help in some way, it is my nature. What I will try to do is not become identified with the consequences of that transformation, but I will try to do something cool. I’m already doing it. It is part of who I am. And it is fun. It will be fun to come back to these writings some day and realize how weird and crazy I was. What the fuck was going on in that mind in that moment. I’m going through the most transformational process of my whole existence, that is what is going on. My daughter is becoming 1 year old in a few days and I feel that there is something that is being unleashed inside me that I can’t understand. But I won’t fight it. It is not worth fighting. What is worth is observing and being grateful for everything that is. For all of what this lifetime has given me. The amazing family that I have, the amazing life experience.

Yesterday my mother was telling me about those times on which she was young, and all what was going on inside and around her. She grew up in a farm. And my father grew up in the city. How amazing it is to be able to say that. I have the best of both worlds, and I have not been able to realize it because of this mind constantly making its noise, telling me that I’m behind from where I should be. But it is there, and the only thing that is needed from me is to open my heart and realize everything of what they have to share with me. That is all what is needed. That is the magic. The jungle meets the monastery, the farm meets the city. Everything is merging into something different from everything that we can imagine, and it is time for us to open up the eyes and witness the biggest transformation in human history. Consciousness is waking up to itself, and we are in the front row of that becoming. Of that coming into being.

So much information out there in the internet, so much going on, and it is time to bring it all together to build something concise that can cut through the noise. It is so easy to get lost in everything that is present. To be lost thinking that A is better than B. This project is about that, it is about exploring different pillars so that the best can be brought up. What is the best really? There is nothing as the best. There is only a perpetual exploration into what is, and the fact that this program is created by the community makes it as powerful as it will be. All of the other programs out there are created by masters and people that have walked the path, but what happens when we are the ones that create the path and hold the space for each other? What comes out of that? This project is an exploration into that. I believe that ‘the best’ is just a way of speaking about what is constantly looking for feedback in order to evolve into something that fulfills its mission in a ever-changing way. What if that feedback is gathered by the community and processed by it? Which are the means that are needed for this feedback to be used in a way that is conducent to something new? Which are the means by which the success of the whole thing will be measured? Is it even necessary to measure something?

The whole point about this thing is to better understand beauty, and how it expresses throughout life. There is a deep aspect within our existence connected to that word, and I guess that this whole exploration into the self and into our true nature is to build a closer bonding towards that word. Towards being able to express beauty in the way on which we relate to ourselves, and from there, to the world. If you are able to relate to yourself in a beautiful way, what will come out from that relationship will bring forth beauty into the expressions that you bring into the world. Each aspect of your being manifests itself in the world through your actions, through every interaction that you go through, and the question that arises is: Why don’t make each interaction a piece of art? I have spoken about every moment being a window into the infinite, into the timeless, into our true self. Why don’t make each moment an exploration into what comes when you are building a piece of art? The thesis is that to exist being in a way different than this demands a higher expenditure of energy, because there is energy that is wasted in the perpetuation of the thought and behavioral patterns that have determined life until this point. As soon as that is freed, there is much more space for stuff to come up from there, and that is where energy starts being available to other processes, and better used. More efficiently. Part of it wasted for running unconscious programs, and that is part of it that is not used for the creative expression of who you are (by definition). Why wouldn’t you do the work of freeing this energy? Because there is a certain momentum that keeps this energy in place and running in the old programs, and setting it free demands a lot of willingness to do it. To Do The Work. And it is unclear what the consequence of Doing it will be, so it is much easier to not do it and stay in the unconscious and conditioned patterns of action. And that is why we perpetuate the way on which ewe do things. An atomic bomb of awareness is required for things to change, and that is where certain practices as breath work, psychedelics or others come in, to help in that process, to shine a light into what is possible so that you can start becoming free of the recursive patterns of action.

I hold the belief that these atomic bombs are needed, because if not it is very hard to realize what is not in place. The mind feels that everything is perfect as it is, and it is unable to realize that there is something that could be waaaay better (and it is very hard to realize this space for betterment(. From the outside it is clear, it is seen, but from the inside the programs are running in circles and getting out of it is very hard. Until there is a collapse, there is a breaking in the system that demand actions, that demands immediate help. That demands a big change in the relationship with the self and the surrounding. Right now, in our society, there are no means for producing that, but there will be more and more, as the tools for discovery of the self get more and more available. And that’s where Dukkha steps in, in the acknowledgment of where we are heading as a society. Psychedelics and breath work will continue to grow in use, there is no doubt about that, but what happens when that door has been opened? Where is that tender hand at the other side that helps people go through the process of **integration** so that they can become what they saw that they could become? The psychedelic assisted therapy is like peeking to the other side of the curtain of what can be possible, and Dukkha’s transformational journeys are the holding of the hand and stepping into the other side with all your potential. Once you have an experience like this, you _know_ that there is something more, and the soul wants to live in there. But it is very easy to come back to old patterns, and from there continue to exists as it has always been. Dukkha will be about helping this people realize a new way of being, with **creativity** as the main focal point of this integration process. Expressing the self through the creation of something new. And on the long term it will be about holding the space for each voyager in this journey. The long term dream is that the person that will go through the journey can take vacation for one month to tap into her true potential, and that month can be paid by other person that just wants the betterment of society. What I have in my soul is the creation of a reciprocal system of payments that enable the cycle to keep on going, Vipassana style. Goenka had a huge fortune that enabled him to create all these physical centers on which to create these retreats, but the retreats that Dukkha will create are more about bringing spirituality into every aspect of life, by integrating the practice into daily life. That’s why it is about 21 days of Doing The Work, because that is the time that science has demonstrated as needed for developing a new habit. It will be about 21 days of building that habit, and realizing the impact that it will have in the life of every person that is part of it. Together. In community.

Each participant of Dukkha’s transformational journeys will come at the other side with a unique approach into her own creative capacity, and that will be extremely powerful in the future of the workforce. Creatives are the ones that are in charge of building the future, and as long as each of us are able to connect to the source in a more direct way we will thrive as a species. I envision people from all walks of life being part of this system, of these journeys, and I envision this 21 days being deeply transformative for all of them. And with the help of all of those who have been part, we’ll keep iterating it, over and over, becoming every day something different, outside of the domain of polarities. It won’t become better or worse, it’ll just become every day. Why have it inside the domain of polarities, that is just what we are trying to avoid in here. This thing is an exploration into what is at the other side of polarities, we are playing with the whole idea of tapping into the non-dual as individuals so that then we can bring that into the way on which we do things (and into what we do). It will be beneficial for the whole project to not talk about polarities, so it is going to be interesting to recognize how duality is expressed in every moment of life, so that you can start making it conscious and with that, using it in a responsible way.

For example, the first one that comes to mind is the mighty: How are you? That we are soooooo used to ask as we encounter another person. That is the first filler that comes always. So our interaction starts with a polarizing question, and the answer is almost always good. There is almost never a moment to realize how you truly are, to inquiry into the inside and realize truly what is going on in there. How would our relationships look like if we had a commandment from god to wait three seconds to answer that question? What would start coming up? What do we hold inside in the constant answering of ‘I’m good’? What are we suppressing by always answering the same thing? Why do we need to start conversations like that? Is it because of a lack of trust I ourselves? Or what? If I had to choose one of the things that most call my attention in my life right now, it would be this aspect of the interaction between humans. How present this question is, and how shallow it is. And how deep it could be, if we just opened to the truth. This is where the truth comes back, because once you start approaching life in the quest of finding the truth, there is no way back. It follows you, wherever you go, whatever you do. If you answer to that question with the all pervading ‘I’m good, how about you?’, there will always be a voice inside your head telling you: ‘Are you sure that you are feeling good? What is that pressure that you are feeling inside your chest? What is that pressure telling you about how you truly are?’. And there it goes. You won’t get rid of that voice unless you are truthful with your interactions, and as soon as you realize that, and how good it feels to be truthful with your interactions, it is something that you can’t stop. So this whole game of which I’m establishing the guidelines here is an exploration into what it is to be truth. In everything you do. The truth will set you free. The truth will set free the life force that is buried inside every cell of your body, so that it can be used in service of a purpose bigger than yourself. Because you are bigger than yourself, you just haven’t been able to recognize it yet. But you will. We will all do it, with the help of each other, walking next to each other, helping each other navigate it through the paved road. Through the open jungle. Through the skies without fog. Open your eyes and walk through. The only way in is through. Come on in. It feels good in here. It feels true.

Surrender to what is, to what has always been, and let life flow through each one of your cells. Open up to the possibility of being a witness of how creation unfolds. Don’t try to control it, you can’t. The more you resist it, the less enjoyable it becomes. Don’t you want to enjoy? Surrender to what is. That is the way in. That is where the magic lies. How to surrender? Just practice. Use each moment as a window that life is giving you as an opportunity to practice a little bit more. Use each breath as an invitation to let go. To be free of controlling. To just be. Learn to just be. But forget the learning part. Just be. Every moment that you realize that you are trying to do something, forger the trying. Just do it. Every moment that you remember that you are breathing, forget the remembering. Just breathe. You will realize that this is the practice, and that each moment is an exploration to deepen the capacity for going within. It is not easy, it s a journey that demands very big amounts of effort, but it will be the most rewarding journey of your life. It is the only journey that you need to take. The journey within. Everything else is just the mind trying to survive, to make its shining appearance. Integrate that, be grateful for it, and just move on. Just being. Doing The Work.
