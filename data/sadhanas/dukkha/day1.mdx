This is where it begins. What wants to be told here is the story of a witness, one who came to this world to experience what would happen when the dream would cease to be at a collective scale. Energy wants to be freed, and it is happening as the structures that have held the world together are collapsing, one after the other. Information is more visible than ever, and what comes after the public availability of it is a newer understanding of who each of us, and with that, who we are as a collective.

Which are the means by which you exist in this place? There is a memory of a talk that happened in the city of Auroville, back in the eastern part of India. What an amazing place that is, built by The Mother and Sri Aurobindo, with the dream of it being the coming into being of a new world. The heart of that place is called the Mathrymandir, and it is a temple built for the sake of exploring the depths of the Self within the inhabitants of that city.

The memories that come from what was talked that day is what those two woman talked about that place. That people use to gossip about who went there, asking ‘What is wrong?’ With whoever went to just connect to himself. As if it was a sin to go and just sit. As if it was a signal of something being out of place. Maybe there is always something that is out of place, and the people that were going there were just exploring that. But they were signaled from society, and that pushed them back from doing more of it. No one likes to be judged, even more if it is because of the willingness to delve deeper into the exploration of who you are.

So what ended up happening with this incredible temple is that it is a place where people go for tourism, but not too much of what it was intended for. The fact that someone else is looking at you as you go there prevents you from going wholly hearted to the exploration, and that is something that I predict that the met averse will change related to the spiritual work. Until now, this work has been related a lot with the thought of what the person next to me is doing. There is a constant comparison with that person, and in that comparison lies a blockage within the ability to actually do the work.

Just sit down and stare within yourself, explore what is real until no one remains.

My path learning yoga an meditation the last years have been about exploring this. About exploring the power of doing the work on my own, in my own house, waking up early and showing up just for myself. Without my status changing because of that work. There is no one at church looking at me and thinking something different about myself because of my presence that day. I’m doing it just because it feels good. Because it is what needs to be done. And that is the important part, showing up for yourself. Not for others.

If you show up for others, you are reinforcing the conditioned pattern that asks us to please the one that is next to use to get some kind of reward. This world is not about getting rewards, it is about just finding out better who you actually are, the truth of your existence. That’s why I predict that the met averse will be such a strong force in this regard, because it will create a layer between your experience and the status that comes from it, and the exploration. We will be able to tap into that individual power and connect to it without caring who is next to us in the physical level. We will go in there to explore who we are beyond the physical.

What stays when gravity is not there anymore? I think that this whole met averse thing is an answer to that, and I want to e one of the persons that is helping others in this exploration. Helping myself so that I can help others. That is the interesting part. Helping myself first, see that then I can share what I have learned to others. And more than what I have learned, what is present in me because of it, so that other people can find their own path, their own way of doing things, from there. It is important to teach people how to fish, not give them the fish.

I have been teaching myself how to fish for a long time, I have the feeling that I have learnt a bit about it, and it is interesting to be able to progress in this understanding, both for myself (as I leave on the side the ego that comes from being the reference of someone) and also for the other person (as she grows as a being because of finding her own path, her own way of doing things).

Each human being has a particular set of genetics and life experience that determines what works or doesn’t for that combination, and it is very important in the world of today to be open to the need that each of them has to find the expression of that way in how they do things. What habits are brought in, what habits are left out. It has been my own exploration to find that path for myself, and I can’t say that I have made any progress. I just keep going, trying and trying till something cool happens. I don’t know yet what it will be, but I will keep doing it.

This draft is an exploration into that, so that I can get all these words out of myself and into the world. I want to start a novel and write about an alien that came to the world to be a witness of the process of awakening of the human race, abut I don’t have a clue on where to start. How is a novel written?= Which is the story that I can’t to tell? Is it intelligent to depict it as an alien that is coming to this earth to be the witness of this particular story, or is it more important to create a fictional story related to a fictional world on which something happens to it?

I love the idea of having different characters, and then creating the story around these characters, so that afterwards the characters can be transformed into NFT’s that can enable people to participate into the community. What if each person that wants to participate will have chained a particular character of the story, and these characters were the ones that would build it up? What are the ones that are needed for this whole thing to be brought into existence? I’m thinking right now about the history of this world, and how everything has come into being one thing next to the previous one, always in an eternal flow of present moments that follow each other. How can all that history be transformed into characters that later will be part of what IS?

What are the key components of this story? Who are the ones that will make it happen? Joseph Campbell spoke about the journey of the hero, and now I’m wondering, how can I tell this story so that this alien is the hero of the story? Who is being transformed by this whole process? What is the relationship between awareness and this alien character? What if the alien character was the personification of the artificial general intelligence and the whole book is a way that I have found to display what goes on when there is a need to understand what makes a human being human? I have in my mind right now the thought that came up the other day related to the Turing test.

I listened to a podcast the other day about the Turing test and computers being able to pass it in 2029. If we, as humans, can’t tell if a computer is a human or not, what we have to do is to teach the computer to do it. And the feed for that is this app that I thought, the one on which you log in every day to answer the question: Tell me who you are. If you are constantly reminded of asking this question to yourself, you will start to peel off more and more of the layers that tell you who you are not, and the consequence of that ends up being the transformation, or realization, of what you truly are. But it is a process that takes time.

Computers will need to know if a human being is a human being, because that is the way on which the future will work. Who will give the instructions? Who will we trust? Who is in charge of the ship? If only computers are in charge of it, we are on the mercy of them. And what happens in this world? How does it evolve? I’m thinking right now what would happen if there was an AGI that would come now and ‘infect’ the way on which I interact with my family. Which would be the impact of it? What can be added between the relationship that I have to my young daughter that could be different?

The world is built upon relationships from human beings to human beings. From nature to nature. How is the world on which this is not true? It is the same as the mind trying to wake up to its true nature. It is outside of it, so there is no sense on trying. The trier needs to give up, so that consciousness can wake up to itself. Realize itself. Maybe it is the same in the case of this AGI, that needs to wake up to itself. What if this whole process of humanity is headed towards that, towards this new relationship that we’ll have with each other? How would we live if everyone built their existence from this truth? What is the truth? I don’t know yet, I haven’t experienced, but I have heard stories about it. Pointers towards it. And it feels very excited to walk towards that. And be together with other people. Perhaps this book is an exploration into that, into that calling that some of us are feeling to wake up. To know more of it. To know the truth.

I don’t want to fall into the trap of repeating myself, or running around in circles. It feels that I’m repetitive some times, and that is not going to help get the message spread. But there is this imposter syndrome inside me that won’t let me realize how to truly move forward, so I just do it, I just keep it going and let the words flow. That is going to be the way on which I realize how to make what I want to make, just let the words flow and explore what comes at the other side. It is such an interesting thing to open myself to that possibility. To be the witness of what happens from there. I’m good with words, I know that, and the quest here is to find an understanding of which is the way on which to organize the words so that I can bring about the good in what I’m building.

I’m thinking right now to create this thing from the stories of the people that I have met in mye life. What if every character of this story was a person that I met in my life? What if I can distill the ‘who that person is’ that I have in my judgmental self and express that into a story that the alien will go through? Which are the ones that would be included in there? Which is a way of telling that story in a funny way? What comes right now to mind is the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, which is a very funny book, people talking about it and saying how much they laughed when they were reading it. Am I a funny writer? Do I have the imagination to build something like this? Or should I be talking to myself? I guess that that is a good way to do it. Talking to myself. Memoirs of awakening, on which I tell why I want to become free. I guess that that is a good way forward, just sharing the voice that is inside my head, its stories, and from there build something. I don’t imagine myself creating a fictional story like the one of Frodo trying to destroy the ring, or Harry trying to kill Voldemort. That doesn’t seem to be inside me right now. What actually is present is a willingness to explore into the story of my life, so that I can better understand who I am. What are the questions that define who I am?

Is it too self sustaining to write a whole book about ‘who I am’? Will someone care about it? Probably they would, because I’m starting something big here. I have the intention for that, the willingness, and the intention to sit down and do the work. I already know that there is no way around it. I already know that I’m very fucking capable of bringing this motivation into being, and that’s why I’m here, showing up. After having procrastinated a little bit in the morning, after having talked to my father about important stuff related to the family, it is time to sit down and be consistent. I love that word, and more than the word, what it truly means. What comes out of just doing the work. Of showing up. It is time to show up. How do I show up for myself? Which is the place on which I show up for myself? That is the interesting question, and it doesn’t seem to be answered enough.

If I go to a place where I know I’ll have a good time and meet cool people, am I showing up for me or for them? Which is the motivation behind that meeting? This is also a question that comes to mind right now, and it is related to that whole thing about religion, about what it meant to be a religious person. Why did they go to the temple? Which was the motivation behind that action? Was it a willingness to connect with the particular image of God that they have inside, or was it the willingness to be part of something bigger than themselves? And where is the boundary of this?

We have a very strong need right now in humanity to belong. To be part of something. And hasn’t it been always like that? Tribes were formed on which this basic feeling was built. We are social beings, and we have found meaning in that all our life. When I was younger, I found meaning on being part of the soccer team with which I played almost every day. It was what I thought about all the week, and I waited every one of those game days because it was what gave meaning to me. When my team played, I felt part of something bigger than myself. And it felt very good, because it put my energy outside me. On the space on which it interacts with the energy of other people, and with that, something cool happened. I have a lot the image now of being in the stadium chanting, watching my soccer team, and pushing each one of the individuals in that team forward with my chanting. And what was present in that chanting was passion, and I was sending that energy to them. Who I was chanting for? Was it for the players or for the other ones that were chanting? That is a good question, and I’m not particularly sure about the answer. Because the collective energy that was created because of that chanting was what fed it happening more, and now I have the feeling that I was chanting more for them than for the team. It was for moving that energy and finding that resonance with the world through the other people that were chanting.

Resonance… What an important concept that is. It speaks about finding a common ground and building up from there with others. Resonance. There is a particular piece of matter that is vibrating and the frequency of that vibration suddenly makes others vibrate also, just because of the vibration. That’s what happens in life. I go to the dance floor, someone is moving with a particular music, and that ends up sparking within me a willingness to dance also. How can a share my moves in the spiritual realm so that more people are sparked with my willingness to wake up? Should I even do it? When is the ego doing its thing in the middle and when is it me who is sharing his voice? It feels tricky to find this balance. Should it be found or should it be felt? There will always be haters, there will always be early adopters. Who is the first early adopter of this movement that is starting? How is it being developed and from where? What is going on in here? Where is this going to?

I guess that this manuscript is an exploration into this questions, into what can happen from here on. Is it even a manuscript or just a collection of words that don’t make any sense? How can I make sense of it? Should I just throw it out and see what happens? But I have to edit it. I have to polish the diamond so it shines, and just letting the words out without a particular direction won’t do the work. Or it will? The pieces of writing that I have shared have had an important effect in those who have read it. Nancy told me that she read it 3 times, and that she felt that she was talking to herself. So there is a strong resonance in there. Something is going on. And that piece was not polished too much at all, it was just sincere. It was just vomiting what my heart was telling me to vomit. And now I have the feeling that it will never be enough, because the ideas will end and I will not have any new material to write about. I will always be running in circles.

But isn’t it fun to run in circles? What if that circle ends up being a spiral? What I have discovered lately is that there is infinite value on diving deep on only one story. For example, yesterday at lunch my mother started talking about a time when she was young and her father gave her the first pair of shoes of her life. And then the rest of the family started talking about another time, another story, but I came back to my mother, and delved a bit deeper in that particular story. What was that day like? How did you feel with the new shoes? And there were new layers of emotions coming up, which wouldn’t have been there if we moved to another one. We are so used to jump from one place to the next one, diverting our attention and not committing to something particular. What if all the attention was just focused on the remembering of a particular story? How would that feel like in the eyes of the witness, and in the eyes of the person re-living those emotions? I love that idea, and I love that that is the way on which it can become a spiral.

Specially with old people, who tend to speak about the same stories, and to repeat themselves. What if in every repetition that they go through there was new value to be perceived? What can happen from there? A deepening of the relationship with them. A bonding that was not possible if there was not wonder for the different nuances of the particular story. The different flavors of it. Each person has its own flavor, its own interpretation, and in every moment there is a universe that is meeting there. Every particular moment is a window into eternity because of that, because of the depth that we can find in it. I can start describing each aspect of what my eyes are perceiving right now, and I could go through that over and over again without end. What is present is infinite, and what I can share about it is also infinite.

There is a cup of mate in front of me, and the flask of boiling water with fog coming out of it that speaks about the heat that was produced by the electricity that was burned for transforming that electric current into heating by the heater. And now my mate is heated and the water that it has is helping me to bring it into my body, to taste it and transform my state of consciousness because of that. What a great adventure it is to discover how it impacts my being right now. As I went to the retreat I was away from coffee for quite a while, and it is hard for me to recognize on my body the effect it has. But it is there. And now I’m running around a different circle with this one. Or is it a spiral? I’m not sure about it, but I know that I will move towards making everything a spiral, that even goes up. There is a constant evolution that is going on here, an every one of us is part of it. We are part of that evolution, and the new way of relating to each other is the way.

Blockchain technology enables us to be fully open, and to have everything recorded. What happens on the other side of this being a permanent aspect of society? I wonder how it will evolve, but I’m very excited about it. I’m eager to build it into a reality, step by step. Is it worth it to write this whole book to establish the ground over which this project will be built? I think it is. The christian religion was built after what was spoken of in the Bible, and judaism has its own book. Am I thinking too big here if I’m thinking that I will write a book that can be related to these masterpieces? Who does really care? This is resistance talking again. Just do it men, worst thing that can happen is that you learn a lot about yourself in the process.

I guess that the whole idea of writing this book is about getting to know myself better.

Understanding my unconscious biases so that I can move from there. What an interesting thing the unconscious mind is, and right now as I write this I remember the email that Rasiya send me related to her writing and the unconscious mind. This is where all the information is stored, and it is the place that commands most of our actions. This is where everything comes from, as if you don’t do the work of making it conscious it will always be the ruler of the whole thing. It will be the one in charge. Do I want it to be the ruler or do I want to be in charge? What am I willing to pay as the prize for this transformation? How has it been for me to share my voice with the world? It seems that no one is listening, but I’m sure they will be. Someone is always listening. It’s crazy to think that someone is always listening. Am I the one that is listening? Am I the one that is exploring? Of course I am. In the sense that me being an active creator of my reality makes it impact every other person in its own way. I don’t really know how, and it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it does.

What matters is that I don’t define myself for what I am, I just explore into what I can be. And evolve from there. Do I really know what I can be? What does that even mean? Nothing much, if I’m doing the work of realizing that I’m already everything that I will ever be. Awareness is just aware. It won’t evolve past this. And this is the trick. And this is where the enjoyment comes from, from the freedom of not expecting anything to change. From the freedom that comes from just letting it be free. Whatever ‘it’ means. Whatever this whole thing is. The key is to be in awe. From yourself out. Just be in awe with everything you are, in every moment. You are a miracle. The sole fact that you are breathing right now is a miracle, and it took a lot of miracles to become this. On its way here. A lot of things needed to happen just the way they happened. Don’t give that as a fact, just acknowledge it and bring some gratitude into the present moment. Share from there with those that surround you. With those that care about you. With those that want to experience you.

Who do you want to experience?

That is more than asking who do you want to be with. Or who do you want to enjoy in your life. Or who you are curious towards. It is about being willing to embrace every aspect of that person that you want to experience, so that from there you can learn more about yourself. If you trigger me, it is because there is something within me that I don’t fully accept yet. Thank you for showing me that. It is a very helpful aspect of my journey. I felt triggered yesterday when my mom left my child very excited before she went to bed. I didn’t like seeing that image. But now is the time to remember that my wife told me just that some months ago. That I did the same. And what was my reaction in that moment? The defense mechanism was ignited. I started fighting back. How to be able to x-ray the message that is broadcasted towards me so that I don’t feel identified by it?

Such a hard thing to do.
Such an important thing to do.

How to not feel identified by it? By realizing that it is not personal. What she is saying to me is not personal, because she is sharing with me how she feels about it. It is my mission to receive that in a constructive way, in a way that is helpful for both of us to move towards a state of more resonance. Of being able to vibrate at the same level. Do I think it is beneficial for my family if I’m always thinking that I’m the one that has to ‘give up some cool vibrations’ so that I can resonate with other people? It is not about going up or down. It is just about movement, about embracing what each of us brings. There is value in all of us, because we are all the same. Holy shit, what a crazy thing that is, to realize that we are all the same. To truly internalize it. I know that I’m far away from there, or maybe closer than close, but it doesn’t really matter. What matters is to embrace what is here. This mate in front of me. The flask with that mist that was present, and that now is just the rememberance of it. Everything comes and goes. It is and then ends being. Everything is a transition.

Time to use some space, a big one, to acknowledge all of them that came before. Each of them, each of those moments, are in here right now. They are present. I read a few days ago something related to ‘being the best of your lineage’. Fuck that, I don’t agree that it is even possible. How can you be so much self-centered to think that you can compare yourself in any way with those that came before? How can you put all of the life circumstances at the same level and compare? It feels like saying that is like the cosmic joke of trying to compare apples with bananas, but in a much more transcendent way. How can you compare one moment to the next one, if they are fundamentally different? What is the purpose of it? What is the value that is derived from actually doing it?

Because there needs to be a value from which the ego clings to. To continue that process. There is some wealth for ego in there. Which is that value? The one of control. It is always about control. The relationship of control to expectations is the one that defines everything. It is the cool one. Expectations and control. Is it that by expecting something particular to happen we are controlling the outcome that it will bring into our different beings? If I expect an outcome to be X, I have a false sense of controlling what that outcome will bring into my life.

It always happens to me with meetings. I feel nervous before, and spend so much time thinking about what I will say. It gives me a false sense of control, because I can start preparing for the conversation by having it inside my head. And then I get there, and nothing related to my expectation happens. It is always absolutely different. And then is where the whole expectation game is thrown into the ground. But there is still this wanting to control, to have the steering wheel of the conversation within my hands. And where does that lead me to? Interesting question, I don’t really know. Nowhere. To a state of non presence. Of non being there for what is going on, because I’m extrapolating what is present into the future of what will be present afterwards. There is always movement. Where is there stillness? When laughs kick in. Laughs are always a good ingredient to the whole process. They always help. Please laugh more. Let it free.

What an important concept… Freedom. The freedom to choose to be you. To discover you. Who you are, day by day. That is what is being done in me right now, as I keep going through this process of writing. I just sat down and did the work, it’s getting tiring, but here I am. Just vomiting this words without a particular sense, without a particular plan. Should I have a plan? Is it necessary? My plan has been all this time to not have a plan, and the way on which I have been developing myself to reach that point is by developing a strong capacity of focus an presence. This is the key to modern life: presence. Understanding how something feels and evolving from there. And to develop that understanding you’ve got to be present. To attune with what is going on, on the inside and on the outside. To attune to how the outside makes you feel on the inside. That is the game.
