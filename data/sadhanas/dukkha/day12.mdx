Clarity is the consequence of regularly showing up to Do The Work. If you don’t show up, your unconscious doesn’t have food for digesting when you are Doing The Rest. It’s impossible that something can pop up magically there because there is nowhere from. So show up and Do The Work. It is everything you need to get to where you want to get.

Yesterday was a that brought a lot of clarity into my being, and just by listening to Ryan Breslow talk. He brought to me a better understanding of what I’m doing, and why I’m doing it, and with that I was able to make some good progress. Mainly in the way that I structure my time in the day, and the things that I give energy to. I was too focused on just writing writing and origin, but not focused on building what I want to build, so there was not clarity actually related to what I am building. There was a kind of big blur in front of my eyes related to how to progress, but now that is a little bit more gone and it is clearer that what I need to do is help in the Love DAO, build Dukkha DAO, work on the Create, Pubish, Profit course, and in there, work in the creation of the community around Dukkha. That is the interesting part of this thing. I wanted a roadmap on how to build a DAO, but there is actually none that can fit that because each thing is different. The most important aspect of it is the community, and yesterday this clarity came from the understanding that the community’s first approach will be built on Twitter. That’s why I am in this course, to learn how to use Twitter and grow an audience there, because that audience is actually the people that afterwards will be part of the DAO. That is the key aspect of this whole thing that I was missing. And related to Love DAO, I support everything that they are doing, and I want to help consistently to see what is going on in there. That is the mission at least for the next month: Build Dukkha, help in Love DAO with whatever I can, and go through CPP with all the energy that I can.

I spent a big chunk of the day yesterday feeling kind of disappointed with my decision of having gone away from the TMS to change it for a program that focuses on Twitter, which someway feels more shallow, but now it makes sense. I had forgotten why I am there. I had forgotten what I was aiming to build. I forgot my mission, and it is time to take it back. There is something important that I’m doing here, and it is time to bring up the clarity that will make it happen. And as I wrote at the beginning, clarity is just a consequence of showing up to do the work. It is a consequence of caring enough to do something that has not been done, with the intention of just expressing what is inside. That is my goal here, that is my mission. It is just to bring about this thing that I’m feeling inside, and it is important to clarify what that thing is so that I can move on with it, full power. Right now I have not been able to do it, and it sucks, but it is also part of the process. This blur that has gone through my mind is normal in this process. I acknowledge it, and it will come back. That’s why it is important to have in mind what the purpose of what is being done, and more than that, establish the foundations of how it will be done, so that I can show up and Do The Work even if I don’t really know why am I doing it. There is not a clear understanding of it, and it is OK like that. It is part of the process of working from the unconscious also, because when the clarity isn’t there, the background is still aiming towards that. There is still a direction that is given by something beyond my thinking mind. So the important thing, as I said, is to build these systems that can make things happen automatically.

That is part of what I bring into the table. The capacity for showing up. The caring for doing the work. The consistency. I don’t have any problem for being consistent, but the thing is that until now I haven’t been able to monetize that capacity so I feel always this cloud on the top of my head that tells me that I need money to survive. And I do need it, so I need to find a way on which to monetize what I have grown to be, to share it with the world. I think that this accountability of being consistent is a big part of the game, because it is what actually transforms you. It is what brings about all the elements that you need to make progress. It is what ends up having the consequences that you don’t know it has. Just show up and let yourself be transformed by what comes.

Going through this different states of mind has been hard, especially because right now I am in a direct need of earning money. I need to pay my bills, but it is part of the game what is going on. I realize that there is something away from the optimal of how it could be, and I live with that, because it is going to be relieved soon. I know it. I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I know that the transformation that I’m going through is very deep. What is happening in me is fundamental in every level, and I need to give myself the space and time for experimenting complately. If I have to ask my family for money to survive, so be it, it is part of what needs to be done in this moment. I don’t feel bad about it, I have done it enough to know that it is part of the game. But I also need to go through this struggle, to feel it. To realize what it is like to not have money to feed your family. To be willing to sell your stuff so that you can pay the credit cards. It is the game that I’m playing right now, in this year, and I acknowledge it and live with it. It is all part of what I need to experience. But it is also time for me to do something so that I can provide my wife with what she needs to start feeling good about this whole thing. I know that I have been more and more providing on the emotional level, but it is time to ground that and bring it in a material one also. And it is also time for me to share with the world who I am, and what I’m capable of. And that will happen only by opening up the possibility of coaching other people in what I’m good at. Being consistent, meditating, and building up new habits that transform your life. Going from an unconscious human being to a conscious one, and giving everything of who you are in the process. That is how this game is played, and I need to start creating my stuff so that I can build from there. So what time am I going to give me to do that? Which is the moment of the day on which I build my personal brand? I need to start developing a coaching program that will let me reach out and help people, and get some feedback soon. That is the way on which I’ll be able to grow, because I need to start trusting more and more in what I have to offer. I have the first person that I’ll work with, Nancy, and I’m sure that she trusts me enough to go into this process with me. I’m sure that I will help her a lot. I’m sure that I can hold the space for her transformation. She is ready for it, she has talked to me about it and it is time. It is time to bring about what I will share with the world and materialize it. It is time to start Doing The Work, in every realm. I can do different things, I’m able to, and it is time to just do it. To be focused and just do it. Prioritize and give my energy to what is important, as AoP says, to what brings up a biggest ROI. What am I investing my energy in, and which is the intention behind that? Who am I networking with? That is always a hard one. Networking. But I haven’t done it enough, with intention, and yesterday there was a big message that it is something that I should do more. A psychedelic integration coach told me that he really likes my tweets. That means that he likes what I’m spreading, the voice I have, and I’m opening up to the world in that way. There is also this guy called Dimitri who always likes what I write. Those are the people that I want to relate with. Those are the ones that care about what I’m speaking, and those are the ones that will be in the 1% of the fans of what I produce. It is time to Do The Work, and the best work that I do in my life is relating to people. That is my gift. And what comes from there is the building of community, of authentic relationships based on vulnerability, trust and caring for each other. That is what I bring into the game, because that is all of who I am. I have been peeling the layers of the onion until I have reached the point where I am at now, and this point feels full of wonder, of vulnerability, of wanting to dive deeper into the understanding of other human beings. We are all in this together, that is the whole beauty of the thing. That is what is brought into my self with the prospect of building a community, and it is time for me to realize that and embrace it. Build my tribe from there. I will continue in this road as much as it is needed, because it is my calling. It is what came here to do. Help people show up. Hold space.

I have Done The Work myself so that I can share what I have learned with others. I have been there on the trenches, Doing it, and it is time for me to share what I have learned. I know that there is value on who I am, on what I’m doing, and I know that I’m where humanity is growing, because there will be an explosion of spirituality in the metaverse. I know that. It is the promise of the mathrymandir but in the digital realm, so that we can hide behind a mask and just Do The Work without anyone really caring about it. Just for yourself. Just for who you are. That is the promise of our age, and that is what I have signed up for by doing what I have done. There is questionings, and fears, and all that stuff, but it will eventually stay behind because what I’m doing here is way bigger than myself. It is way more important. It is the ultimate integration, where all religions come together to be experienced as one.

The last episode of Lex Fridman with Samana Harris is just a jewel, and I need to give myself time to sit down and watch it completely. The conceptualization of the self and the relationship of it with the body is something that is very aligned with what I have been studying and experiencing in other realms, and it is just amazing how all this thing is rooted in our biology and the way on which we relate to the world. I’m very eager to better understand the scientific explanations of everything that is going on here, and to grow from that understanding into a person that is better equipped to talk about this whole thing. It will be huge, to talk to people that are more scientific, and give them the whole background of what is going on. There is something deep happening here, something that is fundamentally changing, and it is time. This is the moment in history on which it will happen, we will wake up and realize that we are deeply rooted to the fabric of reality. It is time to experience life from there, from that perspective, and I’m sure that the intersection between science and spirituality is the pathless path. That is the way forward. Meditation and self inquiry, looking deeply into what is, and embracing. Growing from it. Evolving from it. Who know what will come after this whole thing, but I truly know that in that intersection there is the information that is needed to make the progress that I want to make. And this people are already doing that. It is happening, in every realm. It is just time to open up the eyes and reach out, raise the hand and ask for help. That is what I’m good at, talking to people, leading. That is what I came here for. To lead. To create a view of the world, show it to people, and explore it together. I’m paving the road into a new way of understanding, into a new way of experiencing life, and if I don’t light the candle no one will walk that road. It is time to walk it together. It is time to shine.

All the information is in the table, and what is just needed today is to sit down and Do The Work. That is everything. Just sit. No more rational understanding of the thing, no more trying to escape the mind with the mind. Just let go.

Ideas are blurry, stuff is blurry. I’m inspired by something, and then I go out and start thinking that the future of what I should do is AI research and development. Then I go back and start thinking about another thing. What I truly need is the means by which offer my coaching services and have at least one client every day. That is all what I need, one client every week day, two hours per day of complete focus on her, and that can bring to my life the economic peace that I need to pursue everything else that I want to pursue, without caring about that aspect. But that is the noise again speaking, the fear, the lack of trust.

Where does this lack of trust come from? What is it about? Is it going anywhere? Of course not. But there needs to be some movement, my spirit is growing inside me, but the means by which it is expressed not yet. Which is going to be the means by which it is expressed? By helping people. By showing up for them. That is everything I need, just show up for people in a consistent way. Be there for them.

I’m really struggling with this thing, realizing how to move forward so that I can have my first client. What is the program that I’m building about? Who are the ones that I want to help? Who are the ones that I want to show up for?

I’m training myself to be a breathwork facilitator, to be there for the process of other human beings.

Holy shit, this thing is a maze. I’m a maze. Just start moving.

I feel completely lost right now, but I did my thing. It is weird for me to network by force. I don’t feel good by doing it. It doesn’t seem to be my thing. My thing is just holding space, but not talking for the sake of it.

I’m quite desperate now, because I need to earn some money. All the time the money thing revolving my mind. I need to make peace with that fact. I don’t even want to see my credit card balance, and face the fact that I’m nowhere with this thing. I feel like melting, not knowing how to make progress. Not knowing how to generate what is needed to move forward. I don’t have an audience, I don’t have people with which I feel comfortable sharing this feelings, and I don’t know how to make progress. What am I going to do? I just close my eyes and wait for a miracle to happen, for something to show up. But I don’t know what that can be.

This is an amazing moment to ask: Who is the one that feels anxious? Who is the one that is going through all this shit?
