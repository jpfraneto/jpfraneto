There is not clarity inside me related to how each piece of content that I consume resonates with what I have inside. I mean, it does resonate, but it has been created for that, by someone to grab by attention and with it earn an audience. Is that something bad? I have always seen is as such, since a long time ago, because of the harm that Social Media makes to people. But is it really that harmful? I still don’t know, I mean, it opens a lot of doors, of connections, of friendships. It is about being social, and having a relationship with people from all over the world around shared interests. Is this something bad? I don’t think so.

But what I’m writing here is attached to time, to this moment. How can I transform that into something that is not connected to time, and that is timeless? Which are the underlying aspects of myself that are being shown to me because of what I have inside me in this particular moment? That is an exploration that may be more helpful in that sense. One thing that is very present is my tendency to play the victim role. I remember reading in a book about that being a landmark of a lack of character, and I completely identify with that. I lack character, I don’t have a strong one, and that is something that I’m working on big time in myself.

Where are my priorities? Which are the really important things in my life that I can’t give up, or I won’t give up? Especially related to with my wife and daughter, because I’m not sure how clear I have been with them about the role of a father that I play, and that has me in a position of not acting from a place of ‘the father’. I truly need to better understand which is that place, and how to embody it so that I can give clear messages to my daughter as she grows, and for my wife to feel cared about me. Yesterday she had an accident, and there was a feeling in her that I did not take enough care. That I did not express to her that I was worried. And I don’t remember feeling worried inside, or empathetic.

I feel that being empathetic is something that is learned through life in this society, we grow being teached that it is important to care about the other person, but I’m not sure from where that caring comes from as it shows up. So that’s why I been kind of denying it in my own experience and looking for that ‘true empathy’ in a different place, in a deeper one.

Something in me is waiting for that true empathy to arise, and that makes me blind about the suffering of other people. I just don’t feel it enough. I never thing about the war that is going on, or people that are poor, or have rough life situations. It is just the cards that they have been played, and inside me I have this feeling that I should just move forward with what I do, so that I can resolve my own thing first.

And that is the game that I have been playing here, resolving my own thing and trying to do the best. But on that I forget about giving the most important people in my life love, because there is this voice inside me making noise and thinking stuff that is away from what is going on in that precise moment. That is another thing that takes me away from the present moment, all those thoughts related to how different things should be. It is always there. This should be different. That accident shouldn’t have happened. And because of that, I’m not able to be there for them when they need me. There needs to be a realization of how important it is to prioritize in my life, so that I can start building from there the relationships that matter the most. With myself, and from there to the outside. Internal wins to the external wins. And those internal wins are key.

What is important is that I’m able to organize myself and be consistent with what I want to do, so that I can have these small wins that will make the difference eventually. Inside me. And from there out. I have had difficulty in the last weeks reaching out, it seems that very few people of the ones that I contact are coming back to me, and that is kind of sad. I’m throwing away a message that is not being received, and that is because my ego is wanting to be his message to be the one that is conveyed. It wants his message as the important one, more than the interaction to happen. Ego prefers his message over the importance of connection. This is something huge.

Because what I have learned about creating content in social media, it is always about what your audience likes. And then doubling down on that, and cutting out what didn’t work. They always, everywhere, say that it is like that. And I have not been able to do that, because what I only care is how I want things to be said, and how I think it should be done. I’m forcing a change in them because of my way of doing things, and thinking that I deserve that change because I have done all the work that I have done in myself. And that brings up the noise that doesn’t let me move forward. I keep sending my message to the world, in my own terms, and I’m not having an answer back. It is time to do it in a different way, so that I do get an answer. Do I want that answer? Do I want that connection?

I think that in the depth of myself, yes. I have been hidden behind a rock all this time, not wanting to share what I care about, not wanting to share who I have become with everything that I have done. There needs to be a respect for them. I have to earn the fact that they care about what I do. I know I have what it takes for that, but I have to do the work. I need to show up and do it, and care about how they react, and then evolve from there. All my life story shows me how sociable I am, how much I enjoy interacting with people that I don’t know, and this is the moment on which I acknowledge that and start building from there. My soul craves for that connection with other human beings.

I remember when I was in india and a guy that took me in his bike, Mohammad, asked me which was my religion. You are, I told him. People are my religion. The amazing fact that each human being is unique is my religion. That is what builds up the fire inside me, and it is time for me to acknowledge that so that I can start helping for real. Because, without knowing it, I have been all this time in the position of a victim, holding the space inside me without wanting to share myself to the world because I’m not good enough. I’m the victim because I think that the world is bad. I’m the victim because I think that I’m not good enough. I’m the victim because it is always about me, and not about the rest. I’m the victim because I think that my way of thinking, my way of creating content should be the one that must be consumed, and I’m the victim because they don’t understand it. They should understand it as I create it, and if they don’t, it is because there is a problem inside them. What a nonsense.

I really want to learn how to get out of the victim mentality, and take action for what matters. And that means following those that have done the work, learning from them, and realizing that there is a way of doing that I have been missing. I keep hiding inside myself so that I don’t have to face the challenge of being cared of. I keep thinking or feeling or whatever that I’m not worthy of love, of attention, and that is what has me in this state of not wanting to share.

But I am a leader. I am a person that is able to build up strong thoughts and with that build up a new world. I am a person that is consistent, motivated and disciplined. I have what it takes. I put in the effort. I really do it. It is just a matter of commiting to be focused with it. To really do the work that is needed to bring out what is stuck in me, and shine through that. I know that there is something big waiting inside me to be released, and that process is going to happen if I let it out. I just need to be sincere. I just need to be myself. There is nothing more important than that. I know I care, and it is time to care enough to be able to share what I am. To get out of that victim mentality and start building from what is left when the victim is killed. It is time to be responsible for what happens, for my own reality, and how I decide to build it for myself and for those I care about.

The internet is an amazing place, which opens up the door for me to explore everything that I am. It is time to embody that, and be myself. Without those layers of the mind that wants to be clever. Ego is the one that wants to be clever. And it doesn’t work like that. It never does. All the wisdom is running around in circles, it has always been. Everything points towards becoming a better version of yourself by just knowing yourself better. I have done the work, and now it is time for me to share what I have learned. What comes after all this internal work, so that others can walk the same path and I can be there for them. Not with all these complex systems that no one understands. Nope. It doesn’t work that way. It needs to be in a simple language, that is accessible to most of people, and with a true willingness for them to receive the message.

That is what it takes.

That is the true killing of myself. The giving up my willingness to control, and be open to evolve with the input that they are giving me. I have been running until now with the knowledge of the masters that I have been following, it is time to open up that to the world. I know how to do it, I have studied it, I have learned. It is just time to do it. Kill the victim, and take responsibility.
