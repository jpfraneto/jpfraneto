It is incredibly easy to get caught up in the frenzy of what is going on in the world and forget about the long term, the big picture of what I’m trying to do here, of what I’m trying to bring into my life. But it feels weird to even say that I’m going through the process of awakening and giving all my energy to it. But that is the truth, that is my truth right now. Waking up to the true nature of my being, and there is such a mystery related to that being something even possible for myself. I have tried so hard, done so much in that sense, and I seem to still be lost. Day 65 of writing everything that comes through me as the means to integrate what I have gone through, what I’m going through and I still haven’t gone anywhere. What is about that mystery of abiding non-dual awareness that is so catching?

What is it about it that makes it so hard for me to even realize which are the steps that I need to take in the future? I don’t seem to cope with the fact that I’m absolutely lost, and that my life has been 100% different from the one of all the people that I have seen, ever. I’m the one that has been given a house as a present, the one that hasn’t had to add value to other people to survive, the one which’s only pressure to do stuff has come from within. I’m here, doing my thing, once again, more lost than ever. But why all this noise, I ask myself, if there is already clarity in what I have to do? I’m already enrolled in the breathwork training, and that is a huge step forward in the direction that I want to walk towards. Why is it so hard for me to embody the responsibility of what I’m doing? Why is it so hard for me to identify with something and do it full power? Why is it that I’m always doubting myself?

Which is the limit for this thing? I’m not sure about that, but there is always this noise on the background of my head that tells me that I’m not good enough. That I’m not ready. That I’m not worth enough. What a nonsense, I have been everything that I need to be all this time, it is just a matter of being able to witness that. I know that my true nature is now conspiring so that I can realize that I have been loved all this time, and I’m just making noise with it because I can’t accept the fact that I am loved. But yes, there is noise, noise, noise and the last days of writing I think have been very informative about this noise. I don’t feel as if I am in my best days, and that gets expressed into what I bring into the table here. Maybe it is because I’m waking up later and not giving this process enough time. Maybe it is because my brain is going to explode. Who knows. I’m just being a witness of what’s going on, with equanimity, and with the willingness to see what is at the other side. What is the future of this whole thing? How will it turn out? I have problems sharing myself with the world, and that is why no one knows who I am. And I go into social media and I think to myself that they should know who I am, because I have done such a great effort to become the best version of myself and bla, bla, bla.

Yesterday I had the first session of the breathwork training that I’m going through and people reported having goosebumps in their being and I did not feel any of that. People reported having gone through major trauma throughout their life and I haven’t gone through anything like that (besides being a over-alcoholic). So there comes the critic that is inside me, telling me that I’m not good enough, that I should be different. That there is something inside me that should be expressed in a different way, by bringing about what resonates more with other people. That is the part of me that wants to be heard and seen. But it is also the part that thinks that I am the center of the world. The one that is not able to witness what is going on in his surroundings because of all the noise that is inside of this head, thinking that I’m the one that will bring about a big change in the way on which we experience life. And I want to bring more of that, I truly want to help, but the clarity that is needed for me to realize which are the next steps that I need to take is just not there. I don’t have a fucking clue of which are the next steps, and I don’t have any clue if commiting to write this book for all this time has been a good option of not. I don’t really know, it is a mystery inside me, but I can tell that it is just what has happened. It is the body of work that I have created for myself, and that’s the thing, I have created it for myself. Eventually, it seems that everything that I have done in my life is for myself. I go through this and that and everything I do is for myself. What comes to mind right now is when I’m doing breakfast and instead of thinking about giving it with love to my young girl I’m more thinking about giving it to myself. I’m at the center of what I do, always, and I wonder how this plays out in the arc of stuff that I have done all this time.

It seems to me sometimes that I’m full of shit, and because of everything that I have done I have transformed myself into a psychopath. Is it really that I’m mentally sick and everything that I do is build stories around who I think I am but I’m really not? How does that inform my reality? But the place on which that is dissolved is when I hop into a conversation with someone that is really in my page and I’m able to go through it with ease, truly realizing that I have a lot to offer. Those are the moments on which I’m able to shine, and those are the moments on which I allow myself to just be. Maybe here, when I write, I don’t allow myself enough to be.

But then I come back to the way on which I write, and to the insane amount of words that come out in every session that I commit to come here and write. They doesn’t seem to stop, there is a never-ending flow of words that comes out as I open the door for it, and then I come here and say that I don’t allow myself to be. What a nonsense.

Yesterday when it was my turn to speak in the presentation with my new group of people with which I’m going to educate myself I said that I want to be free. That’s truly the only thing I want right now, to be free from everything that I should be, and to just allow myself to be. And I have not been able to give myself the space for that. But is it true that I have not done it? Every time that I write something like that there is a voice inside me that tells me: Is that the truth? Have you not really given you the space to be yourself? Every one of these sessions doesn’t have any kind of boundary, any kind of agenda, any kind of anything. I just come here and explore whatever is present inside me. Each time that I sit in meditation is the same, me just sitting down to explore what is present. Isn’t that something big? Isn’t that something to be proud of? But it is so hard for me to be proud of myself, because there is always this huge voice inside that tells me that things should be different. And I don’t seem to be free from that at all. And that’s where I’m walking towards with all this writing, with all the helping to others. With the being there for them. I just want to be in service, and by being in service I will move towards that state of existence on which I will be comfortable with what is there. That’s just what it is. I’m learning every day, more and more, about who I am and what is the game that I’m playing here. I don’t seem to have a clue related to where I am going, but it is good like that. It is just part of who I am. I am a chameleon, and I’m being expressed as it every day. But I allow that to be. I give myself that permission.

But the ghost of money is always in there, making its noise, because there seems to be something that is lacking. And maybe it is not money by itself, but the consequences of it. Or maybe the preconceptions of it. I don’t know if that is the proper word, but I’m referring to the thing that has as a consequence money. I work my job and I earn money because I helped someone. Who is the one that I have helped in the previous 4 years? That is the question that arises.

I have helped myself. And from there my whole perspective and relationship with reality arises. Which is my truth? Which is the truth that I’m striving towards? What is the commitment that I have done with myself? What are the elements that I have brought into my life that inform everything that I am, everything that I do? When is the moment on which I will become free from the burden of having to demonstrate something and I will allow myself to just be?

That is very connected to what was being sung in the music that I’m listening right now: ‘Opening, spiraling, letting the waters carry me’. When I heard that I remembered a dream that I had last night, which was very important, very informative. There are not many details about it present in me, but I was sitting in the floor in a place that seemed like kind of industrial, and there was a humanoid presence in front of me that had psychedelic motives in his face. He seemed male, but I don’t really remember. I’ll refer to him with those pronouns just for the sake of being able to elaborate the story. So there I was with him and he told me: Do you truly want to be free? Just come and follow me, and he gave me something that seemed like a hug and put his mouth close to mine and started blowing me air and told me to relax as much as I could so that I could feel everything that was going on in my whole being and as the time passed we started moving from one side to the other and there seemed to be something much bigger than myself commanding my own movement and eventually my whole being dissolved into the air and I felt that I was all the air that was being moved and I was everything that was part of that moment. I dissolved, and the need for freedom was not there anymore because there was no one to feel it. It was just there. And then eventually I came back and the rest of the dream is kind of blurry but now that I remember it what comes to me is the amazement of how this whole adventure works. Yesterday I told the universe that I just wanted to be free, and this night that dream comes to me. It was amazing, and right now I’m feeling sensations of something that seems like electricity but is not quite like that so I’m just going through those rushes of those sensations that bring into me the notion that I am alive. That I’m part of something much bigger than myself, it is just the experience that I’m having right now as a human being which limits it. I don’t seem to have a clear understanding of where this whole thing is going but I do know that signals like that are very important in to overarching story of what is present in my whole life. I’m bringing more and more of that awareness into myself, because I feel that I need it. And I think that this dissolution of the energy that is inside me is the means by which I become more and more true to the message that is being carried.

I have to admit it: Some days I just don’t want to keep it going, it is exhausting, and I blame myself for having taken all the decisions that I have taken. But then I realize that it is part of the plan, the fact that I’m going through this loneliness after beings friends with so much people is just my perception of it, because in all those people I am present. I am there with them, because they remember me and they know who I am, maybe even better than myself. And if not, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that I’m here, right now, breathing this air, and navigating the ups and downs of life the best I can. I’m truly doing my best, no one could ever tell something different from that. It is just that it is so fucking hard to be grinding through this stuff together. To not have anyone to talk about the awakening process. I mean, there is people, I have reached out in twitter and they have answered, but it always feels that they are not my friends. But they are willing to help a stranger, and perhaps that is the part that I don’t want to see.

Sometimes, when it is most needed, what ends up being the most necessary thing to do is just give up. Give up the fighting, give up the effort, give up the willingness to change, give up the willingness to know. Just give up. I will never know. It is not me the one that knows. It is beyond me. It is in another sphere of reality, it is in another domain of existence. And it seems that I just have to embrace that, so that I can embody what wants to come forth through me. As I lie down, I just open the space for movement to happen. As I allow it, I let it be. Let life be. Just open up to what comes from that. Leave all the judgement, all the noise, all the willingness for stuff to be different aside, and just let things be. As they are. I did not come here to change anything, I just came to experience. From the eyes of others. From my own eyes. It is time for me to embody everything that comes when I open up the door for allowing everything that is, to just be. That’s what I came here to do. I came to be the witness of the process of awakening of humanity, and I came to support it. I’m here holding space for the process of awakening of your true nature. You are it. You are not the stories that you have been telling yourself. You are not the beliefs. You are not the structures of personality. You are not the understandings. You are way beyond that. You are at the other side of it. And I’m here to explore that, to embody it. To be it. I’m here to support yourself in the process, to be there for you, to hold space for it to happen.

I’ve been writing this book all this time as the means by which I can understand what I’m going through, and the best explanation that I can give to myself is that I will never be able to understand it. I will never be able to explain it. I will just be able to experience it, to be here for it happening, and to hold space for myself. That is the most important space that I can hold, the one for myself, the tender, quiet and safe space that I can bring to my own awakening. This is the most important moment of my whole existence, and nothing else could be more important than this. Something is arising in between every aspect of my being, something is being manifested from the depth of who I am, and it is time for me to embody it absolutely, completely, with everything that I am. I came here for this. This is my mission. This is the one that I have been playing with. This is the one that I have always been. I’m here to witness my own process of awakening, so that I can be there for others. The birth doula of your true self. That is what I’m learning to do here, that is the process that is being catalyzed by everything that I’m going through.

I can recall a dream that I had two nights before my girl was born. I remember being seating down in the lotus position, going through something that was the closest thing that I have experienced like hell. It was hell, really, and I was there meditating through it, knowing that at the end of the day, it was going to be ok. I kept going, I kept pushing through it, and I knew that it was the answer. But when I surrendered, when I gave up the fight, when I transformed it into acceptance and equanimity, it just transformed into bliss. That is exactly what I’m going through right now, as I move through these stages of fighting it, of not fully embracing the changed that I’m going through, of fully being them. I’m here, just witnessing what is going on inside me, and each day surrendering a little bit more to it. I know what is at the other side, but it is hard… It is fucking hard.
