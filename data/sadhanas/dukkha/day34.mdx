Resting is an integral part of doing the work. That is the sentence that is running through my mind, as I come back here on this rainy Saturday to write to you what comes. Part of me feels that I should give space for not doing, but another aspect tells me that it can’t wait. There is a burning desire inside to keep doing it, to keep exploring, and that is what is present as I bring all of what I am into this equation and just show up, once again. It is hard to stop, when I’m the only one commanding. There is always this feeling of something that will be missed, words that won’t be said, feelings that won’t be felt. And there is not time to let them pass, they are eager to arise, and there is no time to wait.

The rain falls in the middle of a forest of very nice small trees, which remind me of a… Nope, they don’t remind me about anything. There seems to be a blankness inside, as if there was truly nothing to be said. Just the gratitude for people that are going through the same, for very nice people that were parents also a few days after I was, and empathy for how hard it has been. It is very hard, that is something that is not said enough. Maybe because our parents didn’t give themselves the permission for it to be hard, I don’t know. But I think that it is not said enough, how hard it is to be a parent. All the circumstances that are faced, all the crying, all the late nights up. All the willingness for them to just chill, and it not happening. Another place where the shouldding is present constantly, as there is more and more situations on which everything is supposedly in place but for them not.

It shows me how tough it is to be a human being. To come into this place out of nowhere, after being comfortable and warm inside the mother and then coming out and having to face everything that comes because of being at the other side. Teeth going out, a body that is under the most intense development of the whole lifetime, and who knows what else. I don’t even know, I don’t even remember how it was for me. It just was. It just is. It is part of what this whole game is about, and the nice thing now is to be in the house of a couple of friends that are going through the same. As I write this, I listen to their baby crying through the walls of the house, and I think about the frustration that they must feel, being woke up by that crying, once more, a new day. It starts again. In a big sense, having a baby is a constant reminder of the cyclical nature of life, of how similar one day can be with the next one, within their difference. Everything turns up into a routine, and in those simple aspects of life there is beauty, there is something to explore. Because what happens is that that highlights the new things, the new explorations that also come when you least expect them, and that at the end of the day are what make this whole adventure worth it. Because it is an adventure in and of itself, and I’m curious why it hasn’t showed up more in my writing all this time. It has been revolving around me, around my struggles with all this process that I think I’m going through, around me doing this or that, but I haven’t often talked about what it has meant to be a father.

Maybe that is a big aspect of me that is important to integrate in some way, because it has been quite a ride. Yesterday I wrote about the integration process, and how this whole manifesto in a way is the means by which I integrate all what has happened in my life until now. Perhaps today is a day on which I move a little bit towards a deeper understanding of the process of parenthood, of being the male of the family, of having to take care. Are there judgements present related to the way on which it has been done? For sure.

The one that comes right now is my tendency to fall victim, and to not put myself in the shoes of what my wife is doing. And even more than that, my willingness to be ‘the savior’ in a way, to be the one that has the answers that make the situation better. Because I have travelled a particular path, there is something inside me wanting to be shouted out loud related to how things should be and they are not. There goes that mighty word again… How things should be and they are not. Expectations that are not being met, once more. Yes. Since the moment on which my daughter decided to come to the world there was a big aspect of separation inside me, because I was not able to be there for my wife when she most needed me. I felt bad because of what I was going through, but was not able to leave me aside so that I could be there for her. As the male that she needed, as the protector, as the companion that she needed in that moment. The day that we spend on labor at the hospital was an absolute nightmare, and I was destroyed. The thing is that I say that she needed me, but how could I have offered something different from what I was in that moment? It was also part of who I am.

But I did my best. I truly did my best. Oh, I remember now what I was going to say. I wrote before that I had the tools to navigate all that stuff and that it was frustrating for me not to be able to transfer them to my wife, I knew that she had to relax so that the birth could follow its natural progression, but it was something much deeper than that what was going on. And I was not there to hold her hand, because I on the root of my being I was hoping for things to be different. I could not believe what was going on, and in the most important moment of my life I was not able to deal with life as it was given to me. I could not accept it. And the consequences of it were a nightmare, probably the worst day of my life. So what does this tell me about having expectations and going with them? Is it even something that I should blame me for? I don’t really know, because we were not prepared for it.

It is not in my way of being, in my way of doing things, to step up strongly and fight for what is correct. In those moments we were helpless, having to trust people that we didn’t trust at all. Maybe that is one of the biggest components of doing something in a good way. Who am I going to trust? Where I’m going to deposit my trust so that it can be put at good use, so that it can bring something nice to all my surroundings? To the people that I care about?

Just by listening to them. By being there for them. We ended up in that situation because I wanted it, I did not give my wife the space to tell me how she felt with the woman that was going to receive our daughter, and that was one of the root causes of what ended up happening. Once again, I was the one that wanted to be in control of the situation, that wanted to be right. Its crazy how much that is present in me, the wanting to be right. Maybe it is related to that trait of me that I discovered a few weeks ago, that is the necessity of being loved that is expressed by my tendency to be the one that makes the decisions. So that things can happen in the way I expect them to happen, so that they can have the impact that I expect them to have.

I have a sense of disconnection from my writing today, even as I write about something as important as that day on which my daughter was born. Probably it is because Saturdays are days for resting, which is also an integral part of doing the work. I will come back to this in the future, to give it the time that it needs. So much to uncover from those days, that I don’t even know how and where to start. What comes now is the dream that I had the night before she started labor, and how I felt that whole morning. Sick, as if there was a deep purge going on inside me. Going through that dream, facing the deepest demons that my being had seen, and just meditating through them with the power of the mind. And then I felt how I felt, probably because of that. I was going to write ‘probably because I did not feel what they brought into my being’, but that is not true. I did feel everything, and the thing related to sitting down to meditate is that I allow myself to feel everything that comes. To be present with it. I did it, and it is important to acknowledge. All the process, of learning to be more present, so that I can be there when it matters. I’m doing my best, and it shouldn’t be any different from how it has been. It is all part of the learning process. It is all part of everything that just is.
