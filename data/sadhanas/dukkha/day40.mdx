So now I get to the time of the day on which I get serious about the exploration of what comes through the writing. I already did everything that I could do to avoid facing this moment, so right now the only thing that is left if coming here and just witnessing what comes up. There are feeling of confusion present, as if the path ahead was not clear, was not inspiring, was not motivating enough. Something that is important to leave here as a memory is that today (for the 10th day in a row, I woke up to the alarm at 4:44 am and got up to where it was making its noise and shut it down. There was a sensation inside that there was nothing to do, so the best thing that I could do was go back to sleep. It’s crazy to have had that feeling. The last year I used to wake up at that time and start the day full on, doing my yoga practice, my meditation, whatever was in place in my consciousness that was important to do. But now, there was not that feeling, and the only important thing that I could do was go back to bed with my wife and daughter, to enjoy listening to their breath, to hug her as if the world was going to end, to feel her warmth. A big part of me feels kind of disappointed about myself for not being able to go through the challenge of waking up at that time and having more stuff to do, but the other side of me is just tired of it. Tired of wanting to do more stuff. To bring in more information. To have to do stuff. To be the witness of how the world moves at laser speed and passes by my side, with me not knowing how to get a grasp of it so that I can add my value. But, am I not adding my value really? The fact that I slept in and was ‘lazy’ in the morning has me writing the words that I’m writing, right now, in this moment. Are these words not adding value to the world? It is an expression of who I am right now, and if I’m not able to be the witness of that, to perceive it as it is, who is going to trust in the value that I bring? Who is going to like my work if I don’t like it myself? But it truly doesn’t matter if I like it or not, because the important part is to just to it. To materialize it, to bring it into being. That is how the transformation is going on, and I will do my best to embody the sensations that come from there so that I can better be who I can be.

It is so crazy to witness me writing that I can be better who I can be. It doesn’t even make sense. What is that. I keep having a strong sensation inside me that I’m falling behind, that I can’t have a particular conversation with a random human being because I’m too boring for that. Who knows. Maybe I’m too boring. But does it really matter? I’m even shy to tell the world that I’m writing a book. I don’t trust myself in that even. How could I write a book? What do I have to say that I think that what I write is worth reading? Is it that I’m running in circles and every day I come here is more and more of that? But also… Isn’t there some value on the witnessing of how a person can run so much in circles? This is something that will be stuck in stone. The days on which JP was running towards his tail. Round and round. Exploring the depths of his being through the writing, and realizing that after all this time he is in the same place where he started.

Because yes, I am in the same place where I started. That is the pure truth. I haven’t moved an inch from where I was when I was born, because that inch is a consequence of witnessing reality as something that has measurements. Volume. Space. Time. But I know in the depth of my being that those are elements that are built into being by the mind, as an interface to be able to navigate better what is going on in here. But they are not part of what reality truly is. So the truth of who I am hasn’t really moved an inch from where I have been always. I have just been, all this time, being expressed as a human being called JP. JPing. Being a verb through the actions of this particular human being called JP. That is the magic of this whole adventure that we are all sharing.

The potential that lies deep within is non movable, it is always there, and what is changed, what is transformed in the course of the lifetime is the capacity by which that potential can be expressed in the material world as something that other people can interact with. Be amazed by. If I start painting today, the skill with which I will be able to transform the truth of what is inside me into the canvas will be very basic, so the clarity by which that expression will come forth is simple. It will be hard to convey a particular message through that. But as that skill is developed, the capacity with which you are able to express yourself grows, and because of that you can put more of you into the act of creation. I guess that that is why they say that it doesn’t matter what you do in life, the only thing that matters is that you do it with your heart. Because the expression eof yourself is always there inside, waiting to be expressed in a way that resonates with the sound of what is within you, and that sound can be put forth by aby creative means. That is the magic of the age on which we live in. The act of creation is becoming more and more ubiquitous. More and more people are opening up to the creative act just for the sake of it, and the games that are being developed speak about that also. I’m thiking about Minecraft, which is a universe on which people can build their stuff using small cubes, and with that, create. The barriers for creativity are getting lower and lower, and that is the perfect recipe for consciousness to shine forth through the act of amazing human beings that just want to express themselves. That is the power of what is happening, and that is the power of what will happen from now on. These barriers will become lower and lower, and we will open up to just create.

Yesterday I had a session of conscious breathing and what came through me all the time was not trauma, or sadness, or grief, or joy or nothing like that. It was the visions of my creativity being expressed by what comes when I work in wood. That is something that I’m not doing enough, and yesterday was a message from the depth of myself that was telling me that it is something that I need to go back to. The place where I live is amazing, and the potential that we have there for doing stuff is huge. I just need to put in the hours to start building toys for my little girl, or a house on top of the trees, or a desk for my works. Whatever. But there is a big expression that wants to come forth through the act of woodworking, and it is important for me to open up to that so that I can also create in that realm. That is something that I was talking to a friend yesterday. He spoke to me about being lost, about not knowing what to do in life, and being dizzy with all the information that is out there available. So I came back to the consumption/creation ratio. How much time are you spending consuming? How much time are you spending creating something new? That is the most important ratio of our time, because if you only spend time consuming you are going to go crazy. The universe works with balance, and if the only thing that you are doing with technology is bringing in information, or distraction, or noise, you are balancing the thing way past where it is healthy. There needs to be a balance, and creativity pushes this balance to the other side. The stress that comes from facing the void is something that balances the rush of dopamine that is produced by the consumption of stuff just for the sake of it. And not even for the sake of it, but for the sake of having the noise inside you that numbs your experience as a human being.

What are you avoiding that you need this noise inside yourself?
It’s crazy how wrong we got the whole creativity thing. In school we were never taught to be creative. We spend 10 years of our life, something like 8 hours a day, doing something that a figure of authority told us to do. Where is the creative act in there? Where is the space for it to shine? It doesn’t exist. It is lost in translation. And it is suppressed into the depth of our experience as a human being. Every creative act is measured towards a particular goal, it needs to be ‘better’ than others so that you can get a specific grade and with that, pass the course. I’m sure that in the future we will look back at what was going on here and realize how wrong it was. How bad we were doing to our children. How bad we did to ourselves. But I can’t but wonder: Which will be the alternative to this? How will the world look like when this is different, and when each of us is given the space to just explore what wants to come from the depth of their being?

Because that is what I’m doing here. Sitting down and creating from the depth of my being, not caring if it is good or if it is wrong. Just bringing out whatever wants to come out, so that I can become more and more of who I am by lowering all the barriers of what I should have been. I should write this word next to that one. With that style. With this quality. That’s just bullshit. This is me, just wanting to express myself, just wanting to share with you what is inside. Training the muscle of just writing for the sake of it. Life gave me the opportunity to do this, I have been gifted all the material wealth that I have so that I don’t have to worry about having a job that can maintain my family. I asked for a lease that will keep me alive for 6 months, and as I say that I realize how crazy it is that I don’t really have to take care about keeping me alive. I will be alive. I will never have any kind of economic problem, because life will always provide. I know that, because it is the cards that I was dealt. And when is the moment on which I accept that and move on with it? Which is the moment when I embrace everything that life has given to me, accept it as a reality, and move on? Perhaps that moment is now. Perhaps this book is helping me to integrate all what I have denied about being born where I was born. It is just too amazing to be true, and I keep trying to run away from it, thinking that the answer is to build something great in another place of the world, having a lake with cold water in the middle of the old forest where I can do meditation retreats to heal people, or whatever comes to my mind. But the aspect of Dukkha that won’t leave me alone is that it will never be enough. Nothing will ever be enough. There will be always something missing if I’m just not able to step down and witness the beauty that is in front of my eyes. Listen to my grandmother and realize that I’m here as a consequence of everything that she went through in her life. Having the possibility to listen to her speak, to see the pictures that she has of the old people of the family. Enjoy what she shares with me, and enjoy every aspect of being living where I live. Those are the most intense ways on which this whole game of Dukkha is played inside me. And also inside of you. How much of what you have is taken for granted? When was the last time that you saw yourself at the mirror and just congratulated you for all what you have been through? When was the last time that you gave yourself the permission to be proud of you? When was the last time that you congratulated you? That you realized all what you have been through, which brought you to this mirror to witness your own eyes and realize how far you’ve got?

Perharps that is the biggest play that Dukkha offers us. That constant willingness for things to be different. For something to be more of what it is, or less. It doesn’t matter. But there is always some aspect of reality that needs to be changed, and that is the biggest expression of how far we are living from the truth. That there is nothing that needs to be changed, because it is all here, in front of us, inside us, waiting to be revealed. That is the most amazing game that life offers to us. The cosmic joke. They speak a lot about the cosmic joke in the circles of Zem, in the minds of those who have realized the truth, because when you are able to see it is seems like it is a joke. It is simpler than simpler, and we miss it because of that. Life is simpler than simpler- And we miss it because we want it to be more complicated. We want to bring more of the complexity of our own mind into the aspects of reality that unfold in front of our eyes, and that brings up the craziness that won’t let us see what is right in front. That is the game that we are playing here. The more complexity we add the further we go from the actual truth of what is present here. And is that complexity needed in order for us to realize that? It probably is.

It has happened in my life also. As above so below. I go far and far and far trying to look for something, so that I can later realize that it has been right here, next to me, all this time. But is it necessary to go all around? It probably is. That’s part of the game. It’s part of the joke. I don’t think I could be able to realize how simple it was if I did not have the complexity to compare. I need to go full on with the complexity so that I can realize the simplicity. I need to feel the complexity completely so that I can realize how the simplicity feels. It is just a matter of feeling. It makes sense to boil it down to a matter of feeling. That’s how my experience unfolds right now, at least. The body knows, and the information is right there. The complexity ends up feeling like noise, it is lost in translation. I can witness that with what happens when I try to share my voice on the internet, and because of doing it with too much complexity, there is no answer from the outside world. But if the message is kept simpler, it resonates with more people, and because of that it has a more powerful effect. I keep thinking that the complexity has a deeper effect because it speaks to those that understand, but how can it be like that? I need to talk to those that don’t speak the same language that I do, so that I can reach out to the ones that need it the most. If I speak complexity, I will only speak to the subset of the population that are part of the group on which I have grown. But if I speak simplicity, I will be able to reach out to those who are left out by society, to those who need it the most.

How can I help the gardener to be more creative? How could his consume/create balance be restored? This is a question that runs a lot through myself, and I don’t see the answer yet. Is it necessary to be ‘healed’ in order to be able to create? What a nonsense. As if healing was a process that had an end. That you start and end in some moment. It won’t stop. It is a way of being. And coming here to write is a way of healing, and opening up to that, both inside myself an in the collective. If I write for myself, I open up to heal my own wounds. If I write for others, I open up to heal the wounds of others. How can it be that I write in English? Which is the aspect of myself that feels like writing in English is the way to go? What am I trying to tell myself by writing in English? What am I avoiding by not using my main language? Who am I wanting to please? I say that I want to write for others, but I’m not even able to write for those that speak my own language. That is how far I’ve gotten in this game. Someone said that money moves in English. But which is the language on which spirit moves? The language of my own truth. And which is my truth? Where does it arise from?

My dad wants to read what I write here, and for doing that he has to translate everything that I write, hand by hand, into something new. I’m broken inside, deep inside this Dukkha, because I’m fractured between two languages. The moment in which humanity is freed from languages will be a huge one, and we’ll get there with the help of artificial intelligence. That will be a major avenue of progress, the realization that we are all the same because we will all speak the same language. A common one. The one of the other. What an amazing thing it will be to be able to communicate with each and every human being. Well, that is what the project that I wrote about yesterday is. Maybe we will never speak a common language of words, but the one of emotions is there always. It stays. It is permanent. If you see another person crying you feel it. If you see laughter you laugh. It is part of the unconscious way on which we are wired, and it is powerful. It is in the depth of who we are. Embedded in the roots of what being a human being means.

Give up the giving up, let go the letting go. That is the challenge that lies ahead, giving me the permission to explore what is at the other side. We are all deep inside Dukkha, it is just that I have more time and energy to realize it more clearly. Because of the decisions that I have made I’m in a position to better realize how deep I am in it, and write this whole book as a manifestation of how crazy it is to be in here. Of how much of me is deep inside this suffering that being alive is. I don’t have the conceptual understandings of what this is about, I’m not a scholar in the thing, I don’t know how they have referred to it historically, or what it even means. I know that there is something in there related to craving, to wanting something that is not here. There is also something related to aversion, of wanting something not to be here. This has us living in a constant state of wanting reality to be different from what it is, and it ends up being a nightmare because there is always something more that could be done, something else that could be possessed, or a circumstance that could be different. This ends up being the maze. And I have been deep inside it because I have built for myself the life of my dreams, but there is always something missing. Something more that could be here and it is not.

And now I’m going through a stage of this whole thing that is very physical. In this moment I have my eyes closed, and it feels like there was a ball of energy inside my forehead wanting to explode. Wanting to become free from what makes it still be there. I have heard that this is related to the spiritual ego, to the feeling of superiority that comes from thinking that because I have done something that other people haven’t, there is something special in me. This is the biggest lie of them all, and I wonder how I can act so that I can make progress with this strong sensation. Dissolve into the freedom for energy to flow throughout my system freely. It is intense, and it has gotten more and more intense in the last year, as I was working with the practice of kundalini yoga and then transitioned to the practice that I do now, just sitting down to meditate. It gets stronger and stronger, it is crazy how much. And I wonder if it will stop. Or how it will be freed. Because I don’t think that I can live too much longer with this sensation inside. But the thing is that I’m not worried. It is not something that I would go to the doctor for, for example. What could I say to the neurologist? I’m going through this process that they call awakening, you know? There will be a fundamental transformation in the way on which I perceive the world, moving from the sense of ‘I’ that is limited to the frames of reference that comes from the middle of my head to a sense of ‘I’ that is not limited by anything. That is boundless. That extends towards everything that is, and that makes me realize in my own experience that I am actually part of everything that is. I wonder how the doctor would react to that. Nope… I’m not worried about it, I know it is part of what I need to go through, and I accept it as it is. I embrace it. It teaches me to go away from my head and to transfer the consciousness of my being into the rest of my body, so that I can be away from my head and more into my body. Connected to the place where I am at. That is why I need to go back to woodworking, because it opens more of this in myself. It gives me what I need to ground myself and move towards a deeper understanding of the means by which I’m going to be able to bring my wisdom into the world.

There is a big question mark in me related to why I write in English. Since that showed up before, it is time to explore it. And the best way to explore it is to write in Spanish, to see how it feels like.

Qué curioso hacer esta transición, ésta exploración en lo que viene al otro lado de cambiar de idioma. Pareciera que todo el tiempo que escribo en el computador lo hago en inglés, y que hacerlo en español está reservado para otros momentos. Como la poesía. Recién volví a escribir un poema, después de harto tiempo, y se sintió bien. Abrirme a la posibilidad de sentir lo que está pasando dentro mío desde la poesía. Compartirme desde ahí. Ese es uno de los regalos que traigo al mundo, y es súper importante para mi honrarlo y acercarlo a mi quehacer. Se me había olvidado. No sé en qué momento dejé de escribir poesía, cuando fui al retiro quizás, y eso marca una etapa de mi vida que no quiero dejar atrás. No quiero dejar de escribir poemas. No quiero dejar de compartirlos con el mundo. Son parte de lo que soy, de lo que vine a hacer, y en la medida en la que me abra a compartirlos voy a crecer. En el entendimiento de mi. En el desahogo. En el sentir. En el usar las palabras como el medio mediante el cual siento, me expreso, y me comparto. Qué importante que es el compartirse. El disfrutar en ese compartirse, en ese abrirse a lo que el resto tenga para pensar de lo que haces tú. Sin juicios. Desde afuera para adentro, pero principalmente desde adentro para afuera. Qué importante es dejar de lado los juicios con uno mismo, para así aprender a salir. Del cascarón que me limita. El pajarito quiere eclosionar. Salir de su mundo reducido y pequeño, para así poder explorar. Todo lo que hay al otro lado, cuando se reconoce como parte de él. Lo mismo que pasa con un bebé al salir de su madre, reconociendo a lo que estaba afuera como parte de si también. Abriéndose a explorar un mundo nuevo, con la presente añoranza de lo que algún día fue. El calorcito del vientre materno, que me lleva a recorrer la vida. Desde esos momentos de infancia donde crecí, peleando siempre con mi hermano. Siento una gran resistencia de escribir en español, como que las palabras no salieran libremente.

Habrá que darle un poco más de espacio entonces, para permitir que fluya y salga lo que tenga que salir. Este tema de los idiomas es muy misterioso, me pregunto qué parte de mi es cuál. Siempre he pensando que hay en mi personalidad dos aspectos, uno que habla español y otro inglés. Será que el que habla inglés está mas cerca del juego que me gusta, y que por eso tiendo a escribir desde ahí. O será que está más cerca de las personas que admiro, y que por eso me expreso like that. Me pregunto sinceramente, de dónde viene esto. Será que me quiero esconder de un aspecto de mi que me falta integrar? Será que está en mi presente la necesidad de escapar de mi tierra? Será que esto me acerca a otro tipo de personas? Y qué es lo que tienen ese tipo de personas que me acerca a ellas? Y qué tienen las personas que hablan español que no me quiero acercar a ellas a partir de mi escritura? Qué es lo que estoy evitando al escribir solamente en inglés? Preguntas que recorren mi mente, a la hora de buscar confundir aún más a lo que está aquí. Me he dado cuenta que uno de mis objetivos en este momento es la confusión, confundir a ña mente hasta que no pueda más. That’s why I do this kind of things, mixing up todo para así poder wake up. That’s me trying to wake up again. Believing that there is something that can be done, Pensando que existe una particular foma de hacefr las cosas que me acerca, paso a paso, un poco más a ese ilusorio objetivo. Que se escurr como la arena por entre los dedos, al intentar capturar un puñado de lo que o está en ningún lugar. Al querer estar en todos los lugares estoy en ninguno, al querer ser todos termino siendo nadie. Y así se pasa la vida, descubriendo en cada momento cómo construir más de mi. Cómo traer más de mí a este lugar. Y la forma de hacer eso es confiando en mi trabajo, y trayendo más de él al compartir común. Qué difícil ciertamente que es hacerlo de buena forma, ya que eso es la ilusión más grande de todas. Como si existiera una buena forma, como si algo así fuera una realidad. Esa es la mente haciendo de las suyas, polarizando con sus artimañas en este lugar.

I’m writing a book because I need to be seen. By myself. I need to be experienced, by myself. And the fact that I’m writing it in english is just an expression of who I am in this moment, and even the editor is becoming crazy with the shifts in language that I’m creating here. It translates from English to Spanish, and when it gets used to something I just change it. Does it make any sense to do it like that? I don’t think so, but it is just what comes. I kind of feel freer in English. It feels more smooth to write like this. Maybe it is because there are no ways of adding accent into the words, and the amount of moves that I have to do with my fingers is less. It feels easier in English. I’m trying to be a witness of what happens inside me when there is a shift in the way on which I approach the writing in one language or another, to try to witness where does the language come from. It feels that when I decide to write in a particular language, it just comes like that. There isn’t a translation process that I have to do to make it work. And the same with the other one, si escribo en español no tengo que traducir, simplemente sale así, sin mayor esfuerzo. El único esfuerzo que tengo que hacer es el de arreglar lo que el autocorrector cambia pensando en que sigo escribiendo en inglés. Pero fuera de eso, no es ninguno el cambio que tengo que hacer. Bueno, ahí cambié la configuración del editor para poder hacer los cambios más fluidos y no tener que preocuparme de que se esté escribiendo cualquier cosa. Recuerdo un vez que estaba hablando en inglés y una de las palabras de la frase que dije se cambió por la misma palabra en español, en el mismo momento en el que lo dije. I did not have to stop for it to happen, it just happened from within myself. That is one of the moments that have brought up more curiosity to myself, because it spoke about how language is organized within the whole system of who we are. I wonder, how is language related to this whole notion of the true self and how we relate to the world?

Porque existen en los idiomas que usamos generalmente nociones duales, que vienen desde la separación. Me asumo separado de mi entorno, de la vida misma, porque existe en mi un constructo que me lleva a relacionarme con el idioma y con el cómo me refiero a la realidad desde esa separación. Pero qué pasa si dejo esa separación de lado y me relaciono con la vida desde un espacio ‘más allá del idioma’? Cómo puede ser posible esto incluso? Me pregunto, porque hay un espacio de exploración muy interesante en la mente con respecto a estos idiomas primarios y secundarios. Será que efectivamente soy más de mi cuando ocupo inglés y no español porque hay un recuerdo inconsciente asociado al uso del español como la lengua con la que viví los primeros 7 años de mi vida? Será que en la traducción se pierden estas experiencias inconscientes? Cuál será la relación de estos procesos con el fenómeno de la consciencia? Todas son interrogantes absolutamente válidas, y no tengo idea de cómo responderlas. Existe en mi experiencia en este preciso instante un momento previo a decir las palabras que es el momento en el que decido qé idioma usar. Right now I Will use engliush and there is something going on inside me that doesn’t let the break happen, it kjeeps going no matter what. Estoses absolutamente interesante, porque nunca había hecho el ejercicio de escribir el stream of consciouisness lo m,ás rápido que pudiera en dos idiomas diferentes. It feels like my brain is going to explode, and that is parto f the goa lof this whole game. Porque todo es un juego al final del día. Y si mi cerebro explota, qué? Qué es lo que viene al otro lado de ese acontecimiento?

Una experiencia. Algo de lo que aprender. Para poder hacer esto que estoy haciendo se requiere un nivel de concentración muy elevado, y eso es lo que estoy descubriendo a medida que me abro a entrar en estos lugares de concentración profunda. Doing The Work. The Deep Work. You’ve got to stretch the muscle if you want to get somewhere. And with this, I’m stretching the muscle of my own mind. Sharpening it. Afterwards I’m going to go and rest and enjoy my Little girl y mi cerebro va a poder descansar, pero por ahora, toca esforzarse y encontrar por acá adentro cosas de las que escribir. Personas que recordar, aventuras que fueron vividas y que quieren volver a serlo a partir de hacerlas explícitas. Parte del terreno común. Si es que un árbol cae en la mitad del bosque y nadie lo escucha, realmente cayó? Si es que camino por las calles de india durante 2 meses y no le converso a nadie más que a mi mismo, realmente caminé por ahí? Realmente estuve ahí. Somos en la medida en la que interactuamos con otros. Somos en la medida en la que estamos presentes en la conciencia de otras personas, y eso es lo que uno se abre a hacer cuando escribe un libro como este. Porque en TikTok tu puedes ser parte de la conciencia de otra persona, pero por cuánto tiempo? Cuál es el impacto que tiene tu acción en esa conciencia? De qué forma se transforma?

En cambio en el caso de la escritura de este libro, me abro a transformar la conciencia de la persona que lo lea de una forma más profunda. Me abro a estar muchísimo más tiempo conectando con tu conciencia, abriéndola, transformándola, de una forma u otra. Y eso tiene un efecto profundamente tranformador, tanto en mi como en ti.

We are all part of the same consciousness, the same being that is manifesting itself through each human being that is alive, and in the moment that I open up the possibility of sharing my view of the world, my perspective in this maze, my interpretation of dukkha, I become more of the particular expression that I am. And that has an enormous effect, both in me and in the explorations that will come in the future as a consequence of what is being written here. Every creation that has been manifested in the history of humanity has had impact in all the consciousness that have come next to it. And now I’m opening myself to a new degree of expression in here, because I will open the possibility for being really crazy and writing in the language that comes. That is the stream of consciousness level advanced. The ultimate one.

Permitiendo que salga lo que tenga que salir, que se exprese simplemente por el beneficio que trae la expresión. El crear en vez de consumir. El sacar de adentro en vez de traer. Manteniendo el balance, el equilibrio, para así poder alcanzar la paz. Qué ilusorio concepto, qué esquivo que es, y que tan inalcanzable que parece. La paz. De qué se trata vivir en paz? Será que explorando esto en español encuentro nuevas respuestas?

Para mí en este preciso instante, vivir en paz significa la aceptación de las circunstancias actuales de lo que me toca experimentar.

Qué interesante, está viniendo a mi la técnica de Richard Feynman acerca del aprendizaje. Si es que no puedes explicarle un concepto a un niño de 5 años, es porque no lo entiendes lo suficiente. Y pienso ahora, si es que no puedes explicarlo en dos idiomas es que tampoco entiendes el concepto lo suficiente. Porque verdaderamente me cuesta definir qué es la paz. Quizás es porque no la he experimentado lo suficiente, no he sido capaz de vivir desde ese espacio en mi vida, porque siempre está en mi ese querer tener algo diferente. El querer cambiar. El querer controlar. Todos los aspectos de mi existencia siempre han estado gobernados por una necesidad latente muy profunda de controlar. De que las cosas sean como yo creo que tienen que ser, para así poder contar con el agrado de las personas que son testigo de lo que hice. A partir de controlar me hago responsable de las consecuencias de lo que pasa, y eso conlleva (si son bien hechas) una aceptación por parte de mi entorno que es lo que más busca mi corazón. Ser querido. Ser aceptado por mi clan. Tener un clan. Ser parte. Y qué interesante que es el juego, porque en ese querer ser parte me pierdo, y me paso saltando de un grupo a otro, entregándole lo que soy a cada uno, y dejando mi huella ahí.

Dejando el rastro. Eso es algo que puedo reconocer como algo que me define bastante, esa necesidad de controlar que se traduce en dejar una huella. Será que vivir en paz involucra el saber encontrar el equilibrio entre qué tanta energía le entrego a esta necesidad de control y qué tanto permito que las cosas sean sin mi directa interacción. Qué gran disfrute de la vida deviene en el momento en el que se asume como una realidad completa el hecho de que la vida sigue si es que yo no estoy ahí, y que puedo transformarme en un observador que simplemente disfruta a las personas que lo rodean por como son. No queriendo cambiarlas, no queriendo que actúen de una forma diferente, si no que simplemente disfrutándolas tal cual son.

Today’s writing has brought a new way of understanding of the processes that go inside me as I open to write in two languages, and as I witness what happens inside me through that.
