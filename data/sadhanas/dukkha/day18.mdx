The purpose of this book is to end the suffering. My suffering. I’m walking this road so that I can speak from a place of truth, because all of what I’m doing now is point towards where I think the truth is, and I get lost on that. There is a lot of noise on where I am at. It is tough. Today is one of those days when it is hard to move on, because things are not clear. I decided to sleep more than usual, and give me the space to rest. I realized that having a strict rule of writing 4 hours will end up in a nightmare for myself, so I will have that as a goal to strive for, but not something so strict that makes me go mad. I don’t want to go crazy in this quest, it is not the idea. The idea is to become free, and if I’m not able to give me some space when it is needed I will never understand what being free is about. How can I be free if I don’t let me? That is the big question.

I always speak about wanting to help other people to end their suffering, but now it is important to acknowledge how selfish I have been. It’s not the other’s people suffering that I want to help end, I’m dying so that I can end mine. I’m tired of it. It has been enough. That’s why Dukkha is the name of this project, because when I went to the retreat in the Samadhi Center one of the first things that Dan said was that Dukkha is something like eternal unsatisfactoriness. I felt so represented by that concept that it stuck with me all the time, and it is present always. That is what this suffering is about. Not being satisfied by what is. By what life is offering to me in every moment. It is a deep sensation that is felt inside that is related to not being content with with what is in front of me. And I suffer from that, since a long time. And I want to be free. I know that there is a way out of this maze, and all this writing is my exploration into the way out. It is me running around the maze of my own mind trying to find the way out of it.

But the problem is that I know that it doesn’t work like that, so I’m stuck. How can I get out of my mind from inside the mind? It doesn’t work like that. But I already started with this exploration, with this writing, and it is a commitment that I did with myself to do it. Should I continue or should I stop? But if I stop, what would I do next? I’m giving all my energy to this thing, it is the only thing that I do for work in my life, and if I stop doing it, what comes next?

There is nothing more important that ending the suffering. Is this the right way? And there you can be a witness of the mind doing its thing again, dividing and polarizing. What does right mean? Who is the one that is judging if it is right or wrong? The mind. Because it wants to know. It wants to know how to do it, so it assumes that there is a right way and a wrong way. But there isn’t. There is only one way, and that is the way forward, the way of the heart, the way of the willingness to explore into the unknown. And every time I come here and start writing is an exploration into that unknown.

The mind feels uncomfortable with that not knowing, and that is why there is resistance in place. That is why in the morning there was a willingness to give up. Because of the unknown. That is why the noise is always present there, because it fills up the space. It feels comfortable. The void is scary. But I want to go in there, I know that that is the place where freedom is. The end of suffering is inside the void. No one can go in there, so I need to dissolve my notion of I into nothingness, and everything, at the same time. But as soon as I write that there is more complexity present, the complexity that comes up from wanting, and wanting, and wanting to get out. So fuck it, I’ll write about another thing.

I feel very frustrated with my journey as a father these last days. Mila is crying a lot, and there is not a clear understanding of why she cries. I feel a slight disconnection with her, and this constant urge that is present inside of wanting to do something more ‘important’ than just being there trying to connect with her and not being able. There is something like an eternal willingness to do stuff that involves thinking, of studying, or creating, and I’m not able to reconcile that with the fact of enjoying that time with her. Maybe that is where there is a window into a better understanding of the situation, because I used the word enjoying. Am I supposed to enjoy every time that I’m with her?

That is the same society’s motto that I have been avoiding actively on the last months. Every time that someone asks me ‘How are you?’, there is a deep urge inside me to not answer ‘good and you?’, as I have done my whole life. I’m sick of that lie. Who can always be good? How many feelings and emotions are suppressed because of ‘being good’ in spite of not being good? And it is the same in this situation with my daughter. Should I truly enjoy every moment with her from the sense of it being something that brings ‘good’ feelings to me? I don’t think so. It feels like the same that answering ‘good’ when I’m not good.

It is important to realize this, because spending the afternoon with her is important. I have not been able to establish it as a ritual, as something sacred, but this is the moment on which I realize that and I make it conscious. I had written that this is the moment on which I change it, but it can’t be like that, because it is a behavior that will be changed as soon as I establish a new one. It won’t be changed by magic. I’ve got to Do The Work also. Show up to her. Be there.

It doesn’t matter if I’m not happy, or having good feelings, or whatever. The important thing is to spend that time together and get to know each other better. And I can recognize that the presence of her mother conspires with this, because I’m always counting on her to do the stuff when it gets hard. If she cries a lot, there she is to make her not cry. If it is hard to put her to sleep, there she is to do it. And that is not helping me establish a deep relationship with Mila. This is something that is important to realize, because those moments of her crying loud and me not being able to calm her down are the ones that bond us. They put us both through something uncomfortable together, and because of that, we grow into a deeper connection with each other.

It is not about it being good or bad, it is just about it being. It is about spending that time together and navigating the waters of whatever comes up. That is the important thing, and I had not been able to realize it enough to make the moment with her a ritual in my life. That is the most important thing that I have to do. So what am I doing saying that there is nothing else that I have to do in my life. Of course there is. She is the consequence of everything that I am, and I will give her every emotion that is in me.

That is something big that I realized yesterday also. I have a perception that usually parents hold a lot of their emotions when they are with their kids, for them to see them always in a way that is ‘positive’. It is not common for parents to cry in front of their kids for example, or to be angry in front of them, or to be sad. They tend to hide this from the kid, so that it doesn’t see them ‘like that’. This is a big harm that they do to them, because they show them only a particular part of what being a human being is, and then the kid doesn’t know what emotion is what they are feeling when they feel sad, or angry, or whatever. That’s why it is important to let yourself experience the full arrange of emotions in front of your children, so that they can truly realize what being a human is. Life is not only happy moments, or beautiful feelings. There are hard things also, and if we teach them from the beginning about them being there they will grow as more integral human beings.

This is why it is so important to have this moment with Mila as something sacred, because with that I will open myself to showing her everything of what I am, without holding anything back. And she will learn that life is about ups and downs, and that it is ok to experience that rollercoaster. I truly want to be there for her, and I realize that I have not been able to do it in a way that makes me feel proud. But no one told me how to be a father, and this is the way that I learn.

The sun comes and goes from within the clouds, sharing with me its rays with the heat that comes with them, and then the sky hiding them to remember me that everything is changing. I get used to the nice heat, it feels good, warm, and then it goes away and there is a slight feeling of coldness. It has been like this, all this morning, and part of me wants it to stop. I just want the good sunrays in me, I want to feel that heat, I want to feel good. I just want to feel good, that is the thing. I want to feel warm, loved, secure. I have exposed myself to a lot of stress the last year trying to push through my own mind, kind of trying to break it, and there doesn’t seem to be a limit to that. And part of me just want it to stop, be warm, and loved. But I am loved. We all are. It is just that we forget about it, and we tend to focus only in what is missing. What is not there.

There is people that love me, there is people that care about me, and there is an urge inside me to also love myself. To care about myself. Today specifically how to do that is not clear, but I’m writing to discover it. Today I slept in and my wife woke me up and started telling me that I needed to go to the office, to write, to work, and the only thing that came up for me was asking: ‘For what?’. And she seemed to not understand the question. ‘For what?’. What is the reason why I’m doing what I’m doing? What is the intention behind coming here and writing all these words? Maybe it is not clear enough inside me, and that is why I slept in today in the morning. I don’t have the mission clear enough inside myself, and that is why at the first perturbance of the system with weird feelings I fail. But did I really fail? Is this failing? Is not writing the 4 hours of the day failing? What does that mean? Who is the one that fails? Is someone else than myself going to tell me ‘You are a failure!’. Nope. It is just me. It is just the voice that I have inside myself that is always pushing me towards the limit, aiming for me to do more than what I can do. Aiming for things to be different from what they are, always. That is what brings the suffering, because it will never be enough. No matter how early I wake up, no matter how much I write, no matter how much I study, no matter how much money I earn, it will never be enough for me.

So that me needs to go away. The point of reference from which reality has been experienced from my perspective needs to shift. That is what awakening is. That is what becoming free is. That is where the suffering ends. When there is an absolute realization that the I that is suffering is an illusion. But how to get there? No fucking clue. I’m lost. I’m confused. I’m beginning to give up. But maybe that is good. Maybe that is the way forward.

For what?

That is the question. It is for me. And for everyone that is impacted by the way on which I exist. I come here to write as a means of becoming free, so it is for me. I need it. I need to vomit everything that I have inside so that I can become free of it, so that I can move towards a better understanding of my biases, of my unconscious patterns, and with that be free. It is time to be free. And all my work is for that. Everything that I’m doing is a journey towards that freedom, and this book will be a testament of how much heart I put into it. When I don’t show up, it is because there is a part of me that thinks that this is not the way, because I will not be able to ‘achieve something through this process’. As if writing was not the way to ‘become enlightened’. As if there was something different, more specific, more effective, to go through this process. There isn’t. There is only showing up, and staring at the void with my arms open. I’m back. Show me what you have for me today.

I may be running in circles for the next 69 days, but this circle is going to be one of the biggest landmarks of my life. There will be a moment on which I will look back and realize what I have done. I will look back and be proud for the road that has been walked. For the realizations that have been had. For the knowledge of myself that will have been achieved. There is nothing more important to do in this lifetime than the process of knowing thyself, and that is what I’m doing here, every day on which I show up to write.

I’m doing it for myself, and because of that, for every person that I will interact with in the rest of my life. It is not selfish, it is completely the opposite. It is the most humble thing that I can do. Showing up with all what I have to deepen the relationship that I have with myself. No one cares, no one reads, no one interacts with this content, but it doesn’t matter. I do. I am the one that is here, writing these words, feeling what I’m feeling inside, and that is everything that matters. No one will become free for me, it is only up to me to do it. It is me the one that is willing to die to be free, I don’t want to impose that burden into the rest. They don’t need to. This is just inside my mind.

So yes, it is for me. I don’t know how doing this impacts the world, but it doesn’t matter. It is just for me.

Something that pops up very intensely as I write down that I’m willing to die to be free is actually the connection that all this project has with people that are depressed. They are always in my heart as I think about this thing. I don’t feel that I am depressed myself, maybe I am, I don’t really care. The thing about depression is that the people that end up committing suicide are also willing to die to be free, and I want to explore here with my thoughts what is the relationship between that willingness to die and the one that is needed to become free from Dukkha. How can the ‘giving up’ from depressed people be paralleled to the giving up of the ego that needs to happen so that the awakening process can unfold? Is that even true? Is that even necessary? I’m not an expert in this, so please don’t take my words as a rule. I’m just exploring the words that come through my writing, and thinking on what is going on as they come.

There is not a curiosity related to this, there is a certainty that there is a connection between both willingness to die. For the sake of the exercise, let’s talk about Pedro, who is 18 and very close to committing suicide. He doesn’t see the way out. He is at the end of a road, of the road of suffering, and there is no more way out from it than killing himself. The point about this is that every part of that road is within the confines of his own mind. Everything that Pedro experiences is part of mind, and that is why there is not another door to continue than suicide, because that is all of what he can see. The door of freedom, of awakening, is there, but he can’t see it from his perspective because all what he can experience from Pedro’s perspective is mind. He is willing to give up being Pedro, he has had so much of the suffering, that he is willing to die, but if he only knew that there was another route, another way of dying that doesn’t involve killing himself, there would be hope.

All these Pedro’s are the ones that I have in my heart when I’m writing, and when I’m building this whole system. It is about giving them the opportunity to come back to life. To live it from a new perspective, one that is different from the one that they have been experiencing until now. It is a perspective that is outside of mind, outside the maze from which they have been living this nightmare all this time. So how can Pedro be shown that there is another door in that ultimate moment? Which are the techniques and practices that are the most effective for those moments? Dukkha is an exploration into that. It is about bringing those that are depressed the most and giving them a glimpse into that new door, so that with the help of the Transformational Journey they can realize that there is another way. Not killing themselves, but killing their self. How is this going to be done? We are going to create a whole organization just to build up these TJs. That is the mission. That’s the what for that I was asking my wife. For Pedro, and for all of those that are very deep into depression. That are willing to die to end up the suffering. Those are the ones that are more primed to actually die before they die. That is the thing. To help them realize that there is a way of dying that makes you be more alive than ever.

This whole book is an exploration into what that way is.

It is about sharing my own experience in that quest, in that discovery, so that you can become free. I don’t care if I will ever become free. I may not, this may be me running in circles forever, but it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is that all of this ends up being written, because it will be a testament of how fucking hard this whole thing is. How crazy the mind is, and how many stories it can tell itself.

I may never become free, and it is ok like that. I accept it, and move on with my day. It is time to go and say good morning to my little girl.
