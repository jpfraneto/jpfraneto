It may be the maze of my own mind, but at the same time it is the maze of my own creative expressions. The maze where my creativity arises from because it is through this struggle that I’m better able to realize who I am, what I bring into the world, and what resonates with me enough that it clicks. Through this writing I’m doing the work of bringing more and more of me out, into the world, so that I can gather more of that capacity for being in the present moment, which is the most valuable asset I will develop in this lifetime. It is even unfair to call it asset, because it is something way beyond that. So yes, being here in this maze is valuable, helpful, and makes me feel gratitude toward the experiences that I’ve had. They have made me who I am. I am because of them. That is something that I told my parents yesterday, as we were saying goodbye to the house where we used to come to vacation and which is the house where they have been living for 5 years (they are going to fix it and build a lot of parts of it again). I am because of everything that they did in their life. I am a consequence of each and every one of those decisions, and I’m absolutely grateful for them, because I love who I ended up being. I love who I am right now, and there is in me a certain hesitancy to say that because I don’t absolutely and truly feel that I love myself but I wonder: Do I come a little bit closer to loving myself if I say it or am I just telling me lies about my relationship with myself. That is something that is not completely clear right now, and I don’t care because the decision that I made as I was writing was just say that: I love you, to myself.

I’m hard on me and because of that I feel that I’m not enough because nothing that I do or happens to me is ever enough but I do find characteristics of myself that are very unique and all the life path that has led me to this particular point in time is just amazing and I’m grateful for it and I’m experiencing it fully. Every moment, every day, is a gift, and I’m exploring what it means to embody the gratitude that comes from experiencing life as that gift, the one that was given because of the relationship of my parents with each other, and the one that is built day after day by each and every one of the decisions that I make. I decide to build my reality as I go on and on in the process of discovering better what I’m here for and which are the means that are going to help me become more of myself. That has been manifested clearly in the past days with the help that I have been giving to the people that I have accompanied in the breathwork sessions, and I’m happy to have opened that door. The door of being in service, by just being there for others. The door of helping by offering all my knowledge, and more than knowledge, all my development, capacities and hard work that I’ve done with myself in service of the development of others. That is a gift that I’m giving myself and to the world, because there is a lot in me that wants to be shared. To be expressed. And by doing this I’m becoming more and more able to embody the realizations that will end up being the channeling of consciousness that will bring forth more and more of that connection with themselves to the people that I interact with. Hopefully I will end up being capable of sharing with people moments that help them feel alive, that help them feel present, that help them become more of themselves.

That is my mission, right here, right now. And the way on which that mission is going to be developed is by just being there, transforming myself into a mirror and witnessing what happens in others when they see their image reflected at the mirror. That is something that will bring about awareness of their own actions to people and how they impact the world on which they live in, and as I write that I realize something that is happening in the world right now, that is that we have such a clear connection with people which’s worlds we can’t impact and we think we can so that creates a weird despair in the brain that is hard to come out from. Or not? I’m not even sure about what I just wrote, but what I was thinking is that there is people that want to talk to celebrities, or politicians (for example) and write to them in social media with the expectation for them to answer but then they are disappointed because nothing happens. And how could something happen if the other person has so many things going on, so much people to take care of, so many people that are following them and wanting to connect with them. So what is created is this false perception that we are able to connect with those that we really cant. And as I write that I tell myself: Is that even true? What are you talking about? It doesn’t make sense, because the world of today gives me the possibility of leaving a comment in a creation of a particular person, and that comment may or not be read, but it is still there, making its noise and that is one of the strengths of the world on which we live today. Asynchronicity. The lack of the direct importance of time because there is the possibility in place for connecting with people in a way that is different, new, and that doesn’t require for the participants of the interaction to be there at the same time. Or to know each other. I can comment under something that someone wrote and be there as a fly that can be making noise in what that person published, and I can enter her consciousness by having her read what I wrote. And that for sure will transform her reality because she will know that there is someone that is expecting her to do her work, to be herself.

That is something that I miss a lot, and that I haven’t had in my life for a loooooong time. Feedback. I don’t have too much feedback from my environment which lets me know if what I’m doing is conducent to something positive or not. My only feedback is myself, and just bringing it out of me, not even worrying if it is good or wrong. I just take it out, and the most important piece of feedback that I get is: Was I able to do it or not. For example yesterday I wrote less than what I’m used to and I could blame myself and complain because of that, or I just could enjoy the day with my family and realize that it was an important one and make peace with the fact that I was able to write just a little. That’s it. That is the feedback that I’m giving to myself, and I have been doing that for a long time. Exploring in my own experience as a human being how it feels to make mistakes, to not show up, to change the time of the alarm over and over again. To explore the consequences of just Doing The Work, and being completely outside of the system and of the ways on which things have worked now because I can experience a strong sensation that that is the way to go. And I don’t really have any feedback because I’m not creating something valuable enough for anyone (in my writing). Because in the other realms I am having an impact, Marcus shared his podcast on hist twitter and wrote very nice things about me, every time that I go to a place I end up being well received, I can meet strangers and have cool conversations without even wanting it, etc. It is just the magic of what is going on, and I’m looking forward to what comes next because it is going to definitely be interesting.

I give myself the permission to be wrong, to be on my own, because it is part of the exploration that is being made by myself toward what it means to be a human being. Do I truly need feedback? How does my life change if I’m open to receiving this from the world? I know that the only feedback that you want to give me is that it is all noise. Everything that I have written is just noise, and that is because I’m very sleepy. Maybe it is because of all the sugar that I ate yesterday afternoon saying goodbye to the house, maybe it is because of the alarm that came up very early. Who knows. But I’m really sleepy, and I could use something to drink.

What came to mind right now is that because I’m not reading or consuming too much information in a written format I may be running in circles with what I’m talking about in here when I sit down to write. It may be like that, and it is perfect like it. It doesn’t really matter. The thing that matters is that it happens. It is that I come here and show up and let my imagination or feelings or thoughts or whatever that it is that makes me write what I write run free, so that I can get more and more of it out of me. That is the work that I’m doing here. I’m not writing a good book, I’m not being the best novelist or self help guy in the world, I’m just sharing with you what is present and alive in me, right here, right now. In that sense, I don’t have any reference for this having been done before. This is a unique book. And of course it is unique, because I am unique. This is what I bring into the world, a deep capacity for sitting down and just being open and free as I go and write. Holy shit, I’m falling asleep so I’m going for the cold shower.

But before that I want to talk a little bit about the cold shower and the impact that it has had in my life. When I started my journey of self exploration and development, I ended up discovering the work and journey of Wim Hof and was basically transformed by it because I really trusted him. I ended up doing an online course which I followed rigorously and which brought me into the method of breathing and the cold shower. Each time that I go in is an opportunity for equanimity, one of the biggest of them all. To be able to stay in the cold without shivers I need a capacity for peace that starts from the way on which I breathe, and it is just amazing. Every day is a new adventure in there, and as I go in and it starts there is like a nature quietness inside me that makes me feel good. I haven’t found anything else that has -with such clarity- helped me realize the way on which tension is built in my system. Nowadays a big chunk of my awareness (when I remember) is devoted to finding those places of tension inside my body, so that I can release them and experiment what happens afterwards. The Wim Hof method, and the cold showers specifically, are the people that I trust n this regard. It is amazing. And I’m sure that now it will wake me up, at least a little bit, and that is something that I truly need right now because I am about to fall asleep. I don’t know why I’m so sleepy but it is part of reality right now and I embrace it and move on with that in mind.

I’m here to explain better the work that I came here to do. Everything that I have encountered throughout my life has prepared me for this moment, one on which I will navigate the waters of the expression of life through a different human being every day. The dream of my life is to have a radio station, and with that station, have people from all over the world just exploring what human nature is. I love humans, and this is how I bring that love into reality in something that will definitely make the world a better place. I need to have a newsletter every day, which will be evolving day in and day out into something cool, something interesting, and something that will take over the internet. I will stream it in every platform, in every social media, so that more and more people can be aware of the message. That’s what I need to start doing, and what will happen in that space is that I’m going to have one person every day which will answer the question: If you died tomorrow, what album would you take to the other side? I will start building community around what happens from that prompt, and the idea is to guide each of those persons live in the show. Learning how to (live with JP). There is a game of words present with the live from life and the live from something happening right in this moment. That is what I have to bring forth, and I’m exploring how that will look like by showing up for those who will be the first ones that will join me in this journey. I just need a critical mass to start with, and then people will start recognizing what this whole thing is about and it will evolve from there. But I need to start somewhere, and this is just a process on which people will embark to better connect with themselves. That is important, because I have always thought about my work and what I do as something that is not helpful for people. I’m not able to realize how transformative my interaction with people can be, and because of that, I don’t give myself enough credit for what I do. And it ends up being bad, because I should give more credit to me. There goes the mighty word again. I should give more credit to me.

I’m starting to realize that each time that that word comes up it is an exploration into the reasons why it showed up. If I say ‘I should give more credit to me’, how does that inform the reality of how much credit I give to myself right here, right now? What is present within my structure of personality and my way of experiencing my own history that is not integrated enough to give me the space that is needed for me to realize that I don’t give me enough credit because there is something related to my own self worth that is not resolved yet? How can I better understand my relationship with myself so that I can integrate this? But there is another word in there, better, that speaks about a comparison, a separation. Why do I want to understand it better? What is about the way on which I do it now that needs to be different? Every aspect of myself that separates and wishes to find a different way of doing things comes from separation, from wanting things to be in a different way. It is another way of shouldding, and that is the information that I need to integrate so that I can become more and more of what I actually am, right here, right now. What I am here is this separation, it is this way of thinking about myself as someone that doesn’t have enough resources to give credit to him for what he has done.

And it has always been like that. I never give enough credit to me. I never look at myself in the mirror and tell me: Good work men. You did it. I may do the last exam of one of the most important engineering schools in Chile with my left hand after breaking the right one one week earlier, but it is never enough. I’m not able to look at myself and tell me: Good work, you are amazing. There seems to be a deep incapacity inside me to give me credit for what I do, and on writing about it here I’m opening up the space for understanding better where does it come from. I’m trying to leave myself aside, leave any conception that I may have inside related to why it is like that, and just integrate what comes as information related to why it is like this.

What is it inside me that doesn’t let me examine my present with more clarity and be the witness of the place where I am at, without wanting to change it, but just embracing the path that has led me to this place. To the understanding that I have related to the creative process, to how important it is to Do The Work, to how important it is to develop the relationship with the self by practical means. All of this are things that I have deep inside, and that are not present when I tell myself that I’m not worthy of my own pride. Of my own acknowledgement. There are all those aspects of myself that make noise inside, and tell me that it is not enough. When will it be enough? What needs to happen in order for me to realizew that it is enough? Perhaps this is related to what I wrote about before related to loving myself. I don’t feel that I love myself, but maybe it is good to start talking to myself as if I loved myself. What would that bring? To say the least, it is an interesting exploration. What would happen if I started talking to myself and tld me that I’m proud of myself. That I’m proud about what I have achieved? That I’m proud on my capacity to create stuff that did not exist before, to create experiences and connections that did not exist before. I came up with the idea of Human Music and this radio out of nowhere, it was an exploration into something that could not happen and my persistency on wanting to bring it into life. Working and working in it until it was something that existed. Working and working on it in the background of my existence, so that I could know more and more what needs to be done in order for me to bring more and more of myself into everything that I do.

I’m Doing The Work so that I can absolutely empty myself from all of what I’m not. And from there, explore. From there, become all of what I can be, in every second, in every moment. That is the game that I’m playing right here, right now, with this stream of consciousness. That is the game that I’m pushing forward by allowing me to just write. Whatever comes. To just experience what comes from the writing, as an expression of what is inside me and I don’t allow to get out because I’m expecting to be something particular.

There is an aspect of this process of writing that is very informative for me, and that I like a lot. Each time that I’m not in the computer writing and I think about ‘what I will write about when I get there’, I realize that that is a thought, a preconception, and I let it go. As soon as I catch it it goes away, because I don’t let it exist. I want to come here to be present with what is present right here, right now, and not with what was present as I was playing with my little girl. Only through this process I think I will be able to empty more and more of what is inside, because I open up the possibility to make conscious what is part of the unconscious. Deep in there there is a necessity for getting things right, for ‘being right’, for writing something good, proper, useful, and that is not the game that I’m playing here. When I go down that alley, I start playing the game of wanting to please someone, because I open the possibility to write because there is something specifically cool to be said. That is not what I care about in this book, in this writing, because what it is about is just a stream of thougth, a stream of consciousness, and that is all it is. Just me letting flow whatever comes,in the form of words, so that I can more and more empty myself from what ddoes not help anymore. And what is that? What are the aspects of myself that don’t help me anymore? Good question, if I know them I would do more to bring them out, but the most interesting thing about this whole game is that it is not that you do something specific to bring them out. You just sit with them, and in that process, you become them my fully integrating them. That’s the game that I’m learning to play here, the one of being with things and integrating them by letting them be.

Just let it be, and it will pass. This shall pass too. That is one of the main takeaways of my relationship with my brother, if I had to summarize it in one sentence it would be that one. This shall pass too. It is all part of the plan, of the game, and it is very important for me not to forget that. Just open up the space for it to happen, for it to be, and learn from everything that comes from there. Learn from every reaction that I have, every circumstance that I’m part of, it is all valuable information. It is very easy for me to think that most of my time is wasted because I’m hanging out with my parents and they don’t have something very deep to share with me, or whatever. There is an aspect of myself that judges, that thinks that it is never enough. And that aspect is the one that believes that there is something that should be different. The one that hopes for things to be different. And all of that will be left behind, as I empty myself more and more from what I’m not. Realizing one step at a time what I’m not, so that I can become more and more of what I am. That is the game. That is what is being done here, and some days I forget it in the frenzy of wanting to get somewhere, of wanting to achieve something specific, of wanting to be, of wanting to heal, and I’m not able to stay with what truly is present, right here, right now.

Who is the one that is writing right now? Who is the one that is reading? What are your hopes? What are your dreams? What are your beliefs? Where do they come from? Do you realize that if you had been born in a completely different place the whole structure of how you perceive and live the world would be different? You would relate to the whole system in another way. How does that inform who you are now, and what you bring into the world? All that information is the biggest value that you can get from the world, just being aware of the relationship that you have with every circumstance that comes up. All of it is magic. All of it is value.

## There is no moment that is boring, because every moment can be used as the means for exploration into what is within. Every aspect of yourself that is bored is waiting for reality to be different, to bring something different, and is not willing to bring something into it that can be fun. May it be to sing a song. To speak to someone that is not known to you. To be with a person that you don’t know. All boredom can be transformed into joy, it just depends on the way on which the person is living her life.

Now I’m entering a place that feels like the place where you go where you are sleeping, but my fingers are still moving so it seems that I’m still writing. I don’t know why today there has been so much sleepiness present, but it is just part of what is, it is just part of what has been present. I have been avoiding the sensations that are present always with something that can transform my consciousness in that moment, because I’m not able to be the witness of what is truly going on. For example, I drink mate because I don’t want to experience fully how being tired is. Or maybe it is not even for that. Maybe it is because I’m just tired, and I don’t want to face it. I don’t want to face the fact that I’m not as active as I should be, and that time has passed. It is crazy for me to think of myself like or as a person that has not gone through what I have gone through, as a younger person, as a person that is not developed enough yet to realize where he is at. I’m sleepy, and I know that what I’m writing doesn’t make any sense but I do it anyway. I can’t truly stop Who am I? I’m just the one that keeps it going, hoping that each one of this words will afterward be transformed into something different inside you, dear reader. I speak to you but there is no aspect inside myself that can be the means by which I’m able to go deeper into who I am. I feel that I am in this place of sleepiness and there is a gap between the one that has been always writing and the one that is writing now. But that speaks about separation. Wasn’t that I was avoiding to divide? But the mind wants to divide, it is part of its sacred mission so that it can be the interface by which I experiment this material reality. I just can be here because of the separation, and I’m here because of that. I’m here so that I can fully integrate what the separation is about, so that I can build from there. I’m here to experience deeply the power of the separation. I’m here to be the separation, so that I can become the unity. The source. The dissolution of the separation is the source, it is the unity, it is the ultimate source of truth. Non duality is the end of separation, and it is the source of everything. That’s why I’m here for, to be the early adopter of this way of being, of touching the magic aspects of non duality, and then bringing them to the material realm so that I can build from there something that can make life awesome.

The creative act is the art of integration being manifested through you as the means by which you bring everything you have been, everything you are, and everything you will be, into the consequence of it. The creation, therefore, becomes a materialization of who you are into the realm of duality. You bring something from ‘the other side’, that which you and I can touch by erasing the notion of ‘me’ and dissolving it into what is being created. You open up the door. You walk through it by eliminating everything that ‘should’ be. You walk through it by just leaving what is, be. You walk through it by dissolving every notion that something should be different from what it is. You walk through it by allowing what is, be. You walk through it by entering into the realm of possibilities that is at the other side of who you have always been, and enter into what you will be when you are not there anymore. Who remains? Who is there when you are not there anymore? Who remains? Who is there when you are not there? Who remains? Who is there?

Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone home.
