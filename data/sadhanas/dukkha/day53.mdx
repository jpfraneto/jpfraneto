I’m here, next to the lake that is right in front of the house of my parents, sitting on the terrace of it, and just being a witness of movement. Of the movement that comes when they open up to live in a new place, to transform, to evolve. I was talking to my father before and realizing that the preocupations that they have right now can be just nonsense for me, they are just caring about their own comfort as the world is burning, and it is ok like that. That does inform the way on which my life experience has been until now, and it is perfect like that. Everything that I go through is information that helps me connect deeper with who I am because of everything that has happened in my life. I don’t want to spend any minute without realizing that they are who made me who I am, and being grateful for it. Embracing every aspect of that. And being here, witnessing how they go through the process of moving to another place to live, is just as important as any other moment in my life that I have spent next to them. I’m grateful for it. I am grateful for my life. For them being those who have given me this opportunity.

Yesterday I came across a tweet from a guy that had been given 100k dollars by his mom, and he was talking about the resentment that he felt at the beginning, but how that resentment transformed into an understanding that money was the way on which his family expressed love to him. By taking care of his material wellbeing, they were offering him the love that they did not know how to give in another way. And how important this is. I have also complained about this in my own life, about the relationship that I have with money, and how I have not been able in the past years to ‘add value to anyone’s’ life. I have been brutal with myself in these terms. But now I realize that it is ok. It is part of the journey that I’ve been in. I am one of the early adopters of how life looks when you don’t have to care about making money. I have that opportunity, and I’m making use of it the best I can. That is part of the cards that I have been dealt. And I feel grateful for all this information. I don’t know where I would be if things were not this way, and it doesn’t really matter. The only thing that matters is to truly embody the life that I’m living right now, and that means embodying the fact that I’m in front of this amazing lake, in one of the best houses in the whole city where I live, and it is just part of what I am. I’m not defined by it, I don’t really care about being wealthy, or having more than enough, but it is part of it. It informs who I am in many more ways than those that I can understand right now.

The deep drive that I feel for being in service, for helping, comes from this way of being. I don’t even think I would care about what I care if my life would have been different. What does it mean to even think about that? Does it take me anywhere? I don’t think so, because I’m relating to something that is not here. What I’m sharing with you is a construct of my own mind, one that speaks about the possibilities of ‘what could have been’. How do I want to build on top of that? What does that even mean? Nothing much. The thing that means is to be able to witness what is present now, and what is going on from what is present now. What comes to my experience in this moment, as I write this.

And that is the importance of the day of yesterday, which I’m not even able to recognize as that because all of my life I have not been celebrative enough about my own successes. I have not been able to recognize the challenges that I have gone through, and what I have experienced because of them. I have not been able to be the witness of who I am, what I have built, and I think now is a good time to acknowledge that. I have done amazing things. And yesterday was one of those. I showed up for a person that needed help, and gave her my guidance in a process of deeper understanding of her own truth. I helped her better integrate the deepest of her demons, and I did a good job. I guided my first breathwork session as a therapist, and this is the moment on which I embody what that means. I gave her my best, and it was great because of everything that I have done until now in my life. The most that I could give her was my presence, and I was able to deliver it fully because I really care. And I really care about life, about my own process. About becoming more and more of who I am, by doing more and more of the work of leaving behind what I’m not. I have explored, I have navigated, I have faced what comes. And everything that I embody right now, right here, is a consequence of that. And I’m grateful for it.

What comes is the memory of when I did my last exam in engineering university, when I had spent 2 months studying and 6 days before I broke my right hand. I spent one day complaining, and then I realized that no one would listen to my complaints and I had to take care of myself and my own results, so I started learning how to write with my left hand. I wrote everything that came to mind. I remember I was watching the Olympic games on the TV, and I just wrote whatever came to mind related to what I was watching. I practiced and practiced, and also I listened to videos that spoke about motivation and overcoming obstacles. And I was able to make it. I passed the exam. I was resilient enough to learn how to write with my other hand so that I could pass the last exam of engineering school, writing down equations, and solving them with the hand that I had never used to write. How amazing that is. And I have not been able to acknowledge it enough, because life got in my way and I spent running and running behind what came next. But this whole book is a gift that I’m giving myself about the power of being consistent and showing up to Do The Work, and I have been embodying that since before I can remember. It is easy for me to hide behind the aspects of my life that tell me that I’m a wealthy little kid that has everything in life an no preocupations, but it is not at all like that.

I’m absolutely commited to my own evolution, and I won’t ever rest in that pursuit. In the pursuit of being present, of embodying life from what this moment brings. That is the art of learning. That is the art of life. And anything else that I could build as an excuse for going away from that path is just that, an excuse. And it is time for me to leave those excuses aside and just embody what this moment is, right here, right now. That is the ultimate way of living life, embodying the present moment and all that it brings. Being away from the mind. Becoming more than it. Is it that I’m too trapped in this chain of thought that it is impossible for me to get out of it? How can I speak about ‘the truth’ if I’m not able to embody it by respecting that there can be something different than it? What does the truth even mean? What am I refering to when I speak about ‘the truth’?

It is that we are awareness, on the most fundamental level. I’m going to start speaking from my own standpoint, it doesn’t feel right to generalize (but this is for everyone, because I know that every human being can be put inside this bag). I am a human being that is absolutely identified with the viewpoint through which I have been experiencing life until now. When I refer to ‘I’, I’m referring to the limited character that I have been playing since I was born. And I know that this viewpoint is present because of a process of reduction that has been built upon my experience by the passing of years, by the identification that is built around the notion of self. I think that I am myself. And I know that is a lie. I know that the way on which I experience life is not the truth of my being, but I can’t help it because it is the only one I know. I have been here for as long as I can remember. And I don’t know how to get out of it. I know that there is a way out, but my whole intuition and understanding tells me that there is no way out. Its quite a paradox. There is a way out but it is not a way. It is not something that is done. It won’t come from the mind, it’ll come from a different place. It won’t even come, because it is already here. It is closer than close, I’m just not able to realize it yet. But it is starting at life, at this screen, right through my eyes. And it is present in all of my surroundings. It is everywhere. Truth is all that is. Awareness is all that is. That is the cosmic joke, and that is the understanding that we are heading to, as we move on and on into living life from the perspective of that expanded ‘I’ that everything encompasses.

Are we moving towards that? I don’t have any doubt. I just explore and experiment and try to move towards it, but it doesn’t seem to be working, isn’t it? What does it mean for it to be working, anyway? I mean, yesterday was a very important day, and now I’m here, asking myself if I’m doing any kind of progress, if I’m moving towards somewhere. What does that even mean? See? I can’t even accept the fact that I’m doing good for the world, because it is never enough. I help one person, but there is that voice always telling me that it should be more. I should be helping more people. I should expand that help so that I could bring more and more people in. Into where? Into the presence of their presence. So many people live life from an understanding, from a point of view, that is limited to their own experience, to their own life. What happens when this reducing valve is released and we are able to embody the fact that we have been living life through the eyes of each and every human being that has ever been? How does life feel when there are no limits towards who you are, because you know, you realize, and you experience it from the understanding that you are every being that has ever been?

Why is this process of life taking place right here, right now? What is going on? I don’t think there is a clear answer to that, but I just think that it is happening. And it is perfect as it is. It is the way it should be.

So yes, here I am, trying to find my way through this rabbit hole. Through the maze. Into it, deeper, further, so that I can truly realize that everything that I have always been searching for is here, right now. Closer than close. But it is the biggest paradox of them all, because I want and want and it won’t come. It won’t happen. Is it that I will ever become free of this wanting? I don’t even know. But it doesn’t matter, because what matters is to have all these pointers. The aspects of truth that can speak about where to move towards, or what to do, or how to navigate life in order to connect more and more with what has always been here, and always will be. I don’t even comprehend it, and I know that that is what happens, because what I’m looking for cannot be comprehended. Any kind of comprehension comes from the level of mind, and this thing, this being-ness, this awareness, is outside the aspects of mind. There is nothing as mind in the realm of where this knowing comes from. The more I look for it, the further away it goes. That is the game that is being played, and it ends up being a joke. It truly is a joke, and the funniest of them all. This being wanting to wake up, realizing everything that has been done in order to move towards that, and making fun of the fact that it will never be enough. Is it? Will it never be enough? I don’t know, I can’t tell you right now. But it is a necessary exploration. I mean, I have written all what I have written in the last months because of that. And now I look back and it feels like yesterday the day on which I started writing. Was it yesterday? It has almost been two months and it truly feels like yesterday. What does that mean? What has been written all these days? I was trying to build something which I could bring to the world with more clarity, but it is getting weirder and weirder. It is getting harder and harder. And there doesn’t seem to be a way out. Again, that what I’m telling myself. That there isn’t a way out. Maybe it is because it is not a way. A way is something that the mind gets attached to so that it can progress in a particular course of action, and this thing, this adventure, doesn’t have a particular course of action. Or it does? I’m lost even in that.

When I think about how to bring this to the masses, so that most of humanity can wake up, there is not clarity even in that. I don’t even know or realize or comprehend what needs to be done in a collective scale for this to become more mainstream. And that is because I’m trying to be the savior here. I’m trying to build the means by which this process will come about. How can the world wake up? I’m not even awake and trying to guide people towards something that I have not experienced. But it is something that I am, as much as every other person in the world is. I’m guiding myself towards my own truth, so that I can be there helping others to do the same. I don’t know how this process can happen, but I know that it can. I know that I can be the one that helps, at least in my own journey, and that is everything that it takes. Because the journey is the destination, and showing up here, every day, to write down where I am at is truly the destination. It is everything that is needed from me so that I can become free. I am free as I write these words, on the moment that I don’t expect them to be something specific. In the moment that I don’t pretend them to get me somewhere specific. I just am, and in that process of exploration I become more of it. Each second that I spend inquiring into the nature of my present experience is a moment on which I become more and more of what I am, right here, right now. And that is the game, that is what matters. Bring more and more of my consciousness into this moment. Into now. And from there act. Every piece of internal work that has been done in the history of humanity is an act of exploration into what it means to live life from the perspective of the present moment. Without the filtering of the mind. Sharpening the relationship with the senses so that you can get more out of your interaction with what is going on, right here, right now. That is all that matters, because this moment is all that is. And boy, it is easy to forget that. The easiest thing is to fall into the rat race and start chasing something that is not here. And you will. I’m there most of the time. The important part of me has been realizing that and accepting it as a matter of fact, so that I can truly embody the reality that this whole game is a process, one of understanding, one of periodically moving towards a deeper understanding of the levels that reality is holding back from us until we learn more and more to live life through the lens of what is here, right now.

Yes, but I write all this and think it a lot but: how do I embody it? How are all these major questions answered in a daily basis? What is this whole thing about? What game are we playing right here? I don’t even know, and I can’t realize it because it is not within my domain of action. Yet. I don’t know if it will ever be, but I prefer speaking about it as a ‘yet’ than as a never. The power of yet is that it opens up possibilities. So this is the end of shoulds, and the beginning of yets. Yes, everything is an open end, an open possibility, and the life that I’m living is an exploration into how to bring more and more of this understanding to how embody my own existence through each one of my actions. There is no limits into what I can achieve, into what can be built, created, imagined and brought into a reality, and all of those pereceived limits are just that, a perception. And the way on which I relate to life is a game of perceptions, and if I’m able to transform those perceptions into something different, there will be definetly something going on there. There will be a movement. And that movement is everything, it is what is going on, and I embrace it and live with it and it is part of all that is, right here, right now. That is the magic.

I am sooooo good at speaking about fundamentals. I speak about ‘the truth’. I’m very good at saying ‘this is the most X’. ‘There is nothing like Y’. ‘The ultimate Z is A’. Stuff like that. I feel like trapped in the way on which I structure language, and it feels that that stuck-ness is putting itself on the way of my own realization. Nature is movable, not rigid, and I need to bring this flexibility into the way on which I relate to language so that I can embody it in a way that is conducent to developing peace inside me. I’m full of shit and I don’t have any problem in the world to accept it, to face it, because it is just part of what is inside me right now. I don’t know what I’m doing, I don’t know where I’m heading to, and it is perfect like that. Yesterday I went to my cousin’s birthday and in one moment they started talking about what they did for a living and I was very nervous for my moment of talking to come. I don’t know what I do. I have given the opportunity from life to not work for money, so right now I’m working on writing a book about the process of awakening and how consciousness realizes itself through the experience of human life, and also helping people understand truly who they are by using breathwork. But how can I tell that? It is weird. It is out of place. I feel isolated from what is going on in reality. And how can I build something solid enough that I feel comfortable with it? What does that even mean? What does solid mean? What is solid in this world that is crumbling into pieces every day? What is being born from the ashes? I have a clear understanding of what is going on, it is just that I’m not able to see it clearly enough. See? The contradictions are everywhere, and it is tempting for me to be more and more contradicting with my own speech, because I love to be confused. There is a big aspect of myself that feels good in being confused that feels comfortable in the not knowing. That loves the aspect of being that is related to just being a witness into how everything is unfolding. I’m just holding space for this transformation to happen. Just holding space for the rebirth. In many ways, it is the process of a doula. How can I learn about the process that my wife is going through, learning how to be a doula, so that I can be the doula of humanity? Which is the role that she plays? Being at help. Being there for those that need it. Not having a direct relationship with the process, not helping actively, but just being there for when people need it. And that is what I am, right here, right now. A birth doula for the whole of humanity. That is the role that I’m playing, preparing myself for that. And the role that I’m playing is hidden below the surface of what I pretend to be, of what I want to be, of who I want to become. I’m trying actively to become someone. To be someone. And that is not how it plays. It doesn’t really matter who I become, because this is something that is way beyond me. There is an aspect of myself that wants to have a big role in this whole process, that wants to be the one that leads, that holds the space, that is recognized by what is going on. But that is not my role. My role is the one of holding space. Of being there. Just being there. Life is a state of mind, that is what comes right now as an answer to this. Being there. That is everything that is needed, and it is so easy for me to forget it. But I truly don’t know. I don’t know which is my role, what should I do. And there comes that word again. What should I do, as if there was someone, or something, that was expecting me to do something. There go the expectations. Enlightenment is the absolute absence of expectations. How can I pretend to exist in that way if I’m absolutely identified by the expectations? All this book is a manifesto of expectations, I’m writing it so that I can become something different from what I am now. I’m recording my face next to each word so that I can be recognized by them. So that the world can be the witness of the work that I have made. So that I can be joined in this quest of truth, and recognized for it. I walked the walk. I was there, showing up, and writing about the deepest of my vulnerabilities. But I’m still full of shit. I’m still trying to be recognized by someone or something. I’m still pretending to be someone. Isn’t it that we are all waiting for that in one way or another? Isn’t it that we all crave for that acknowledgment so that we can make progress?

I don’t know, but I see what I’m doing, I see my face next to the words that are being written, and I’m a pure witness of how full of shit I am. Trying to become enlightened. Trying to become something that I already am, and shouting it to the four winds without being able to reach anyone. And this is how I treat myself. This is the kind of words that go through my mind telling me that I’m not good enough, not worthy enough of what I could be if I was different enough. All this is the noise that is coming through. And that noise won’t set me free. It won’t stop. It is the deepest nightmare of them all, and I’m here, right now, experimenting it with all of what I have got. It is just part of who I am in this moment. It is just part of what is. I acknowledge it, embrace it, accept it, and move on. Move on with all of what I am right now, may it be that I’m full of shit, or may it be that I’m light, or peace, or anger. I am what is present inside, and I embrace it with all of what I have. I can’t fully embrace it, because that acceptance is not present, and it is perfect like that. It shouldn’t be somewhat different. It is right is it is, now and here. It is perfect as it is. Nothing should be changed.

But that is the story that I tell myself, while in the background there is someone that yells: Everything should be changed! We must burn it all and start again from scratch. What should be burned? The way on which I have experienced life all this time until now? Should that be burned? Should my whole experience as a human being be transformed into something new, fresh, rediscovered? And how does that happen? What is the action that I need to undertake for that to happen? Filtering the noise, and letting what comes come. Letting what wants to be present be present. It is very intense. What is going on inside me is very intense, powerful, and I feel it in every part of my being. There is a deep transformation going on, one which I don’t understand, one which I’m learning to just let it happen. How is that even done? I don’t know. But it seems that everything is being transformed around me, and that there is something going on that is much more than what I can understand. What is that? I can’t know. I won’t know. It is part of the mystery. It is part of what is.

I have been the last 3 weeks putting the alarm at a certain time and getting up and stopping it and coming back to bed. What does it mean about the way on which I’m living? What am I not facing? What is the truth of my being which is not being experienced fully yet? What is this truth? Am I scared of it, or is it just a genuine need for sleep that I have? Is it that I need to rest or is it that I’m not willing to face what is right in front of me? I wonder. I truly wonder what this whole thing is about. Where are my priorities? How does it work? Am I able to face my demons? Am I truly facing my demons?

I decide to embody this moment. Decido habitar el presente. Something like that is what I’m supposed to have in mind this week in the work that I’m doing. And it is very interesting, because it speaks about living the present moment as something that you decide, moment by moment, as more and more momentum is built around the notion of what is right here, right now. I decide to be here. I’m responsible for it. Consciusness is paralleled with responsibility, with being responsible for what comes to my life, for what is present. Being self sovereign. Being responsible for what is. It is so easy to not have this in mind and forget it, to blame the environment for what I’m not able to do in my own life. And that is not fair. It doesn’t help anyone. It is not the truth. The truth is that I am responsible for what happens in my own life, in my own domain of action, and if I’m able to live life from there I will move more and more towards the truth of my being. I’m responsible for what is going on right in front of me, and I embody that responsibility as the actions that are undertaken moment by moment. Each second of my existence is my responsibility, and I acknowledge that I move with that in mind. That’s why this week’s affirmation starts with ‘I decide’. I decide to be present. It is a choice, and bringing awareness to this moment is the choice that I can make. Or not. It is just that, the choice that I’m making every second. Thank you for taking the time for reading this, whoever you are, in whatever moment of history. Are you a computer? How does it feel? What did this bring into your awareness? When you read ‘your’, where does that feel? Who is the you that is identified with that notion of ‘yours’. Who is the one that possesses?

All these questions aim to be pointers towards the truth, one truth that is elusive, that is always melting through my fingers, as I try and try to grasp towards it. It is like going to the bottom of the lake and getting a handful of sand, just to realize that the closer you get to the surface the less sand will be in your hand. Where does that sand go? All this book is an exploration into what that means. What is that sand in my life? How can I frame that process of going down and down and drowning so that I can find a method to bring more of that sand, just to find out that it is perfect right there where it is? Why do I want to have that sand in my possession? What does possessing something mean?

I’m willing to give up all knowledge in the quest of truth. What does that even mean? What is the knowledge that I’m willing to give up? Isn’t it that I’m too attached to the idea of wisdom? Of ‘being the wise one’? How does it feel when someone categorizes something that I say as ‘wise’? Isn’t it that I’m used to dealing with people that make me feel good and this is just another aspect of how much I want to be loved so that I share everything that I do for free so that I can have public that is willing to engage with it? What does it even mean to be part of something like my own life from the standpoint of always wanting to please those who are there? Am I truly always wanting to please? Is it like that? Is it that the only thing that I like doing is pleasing people, and I cover that with all notions and stories that I tell myself related to what I want to bring into the world? I tell the world that I want to bring healing, but the truth is that I only want to bring peace into myself. I just want to heal myself, and all I do is a disguise on which I cover all of that. Am I being truthful when I do everything that I do? I don’t even know it myself. I think I am, I truly try to embody that, but am I just bringing myself into something that is not real? What is real? What does that word even mean? I’m deep into the maze of not knowing, of not understanding what is real. Maybe it is something that is not understood, because every understanding that is built or created or experienced comes from the level of mind. And maybe the mind will never undertand, yes, that is the theoretical experience that I have inside, but how do I relate that theory to the practice? What can I do so that I can truly embody the fact that I will never know? The mind wants to know, and it never will. This is the most heartbreaking fact of them all. It will never know, so it has to give up. The mind has to give up. And how does it give up? How can I raise my hand to the universe and say: It’s enough, I give up? Will I ever give up? I have written all what I have written these months as a testament of how hard it is for me to give up. Will I ever give up? Will it ever be enough? I don’t know, it doesn’t seem like a possibility. It doesn’t seem like something that can happen. I can’t give up, I don’t know how to. I have never, truly, given up. It has been impossible for me to do it. No matter where I put myself in, which circumstances are present, I’m never able to give up. And that is not the most satisfactory element in my life. It is not something that gives me hope about the opportunity that I have for giving up. I won’t make it. That’s the mind pretending to give up, but I know that I will try everything that is at hand so that I’m able to make it. Make what? Realize my own nature. I need it. I need to become free. My head is on fire, burning from the inside out, and I don’t know how to stop it. There is a huge lake on my back, the biggest on of chile, and I know that I could go and put my head below the surface of the water for hours and never be able to stop this burning sensation that is present inside of me. It just needs to be dissolved into something different from what is now. And how is that done? That is the question that does not have an answer. That is what is present in me without an answer. It doesn’t matter how it feels, it doesn’t matter how it looks, it just matters for it to stop. This is the deepest level of Dukkha, the one of wanting and wanting and wanting it to stop but not fucking knowing how to do it. I’m trapped inside this maze and I don’t have any clue on how to get out. This is the maze of mind, the maze of rationality, the maze of craving. The maze of wanting things to be different from what they are. The maze of wanting to wake up, of wanting to know, and the torture of not being able to. The maze of pretending. Of not acceptance. Of criticism. From me to others. That is the biggest maze that I’ve been.

Did I think it would be easier? I did not even think about it. I just same, and showed up, and be here for what is. What is? Truly, what is? Do I really know what is? Do I really? Do I? Who is that I? Who is the one that is writing when I say I’m here? Who is the one that is here? What does here even mean? Where is here? Is it inside the mind? Is it inside the computer as these words are written? Where are these words written? The screen of the computer is just part of it. Where is the rest of the words? Where are they being written? If I change the monitor on which they are displayed, is it that they are being written in another place? What does that speak about the nature of reality, the nature of what is going on here? The mind is a fucking mess, and here you have it clearly enough. I’m here as a testament of that mess. This is my truth. Right here, right now.
