A big part of the problems that I have is that I keep trying to squeeze my brain and experience looking for the answers that will help me move forward with what I want to create. And that is driving me nuts. It is not helping me anymore, because I don’t go anywhere. It is just noise, a noise that doesn’t go anywhere. It is time for me to do this in a new way, to stop focusing too much in what project I will build and just start doing it. I have had the vision clear in my mind for such a long time that it is enough. It is time for me to bring it out from there and into the world. It is time for me to just explore what comes when I approach life as an invitation to witness what is present. Make something as fun as possible. And that is the thing, because if I end up making meditation retreats online, that is not going to be fun, it is going to be me trying to be as intelligent and spiritual and everything that I can, but I’m way more than that. I’m the one that shows up and explores what comes from the willingness to be present in the life of the other person. In mind and spirit. I’m the one that the other people can see as the one that has good ideas, and I’m the one that builds those ideas into a reality. I have a clear vision of what I want to see in the future, and more than a meditation room, what I want to have is a place where people can come and get their mind blown with the incredible music that they will listen in there. I want to have a place downtown my city where people can go and have the best moment of their life. Where they can go and just explore what it means to be a human being. I have been all this time trying to understand myself, all this awakening process, and in that rabbit hole I get dizzy with the ups and downs of it. That’s the thing, if people want to meditate, they will meditate. Until now, I have just been talking to the void because I don’t have anyone to talk this thing through, and with that, I’m becoming more and more isolated because the people that truly care about this thing are not too many. Most people don’t even know what meditation is about. And it is ok like that. I don’t have to do everything. I don’t have to create the meditation retreats, and the dojo for creativity, and this, and that. People will end up figuring out their shit without my help. It’s just part of what is. But it is time for me to build something cool, amazing, and I’m just getting started with it. What is the first thing that I do when I put my headphones? Play some cool music. That is the thing that I groove on. What was what I did when I went to Europe? Go to festivals. That’s my thing: Listening to music, taking drugs and having fun. That’s why I came to the world, and I kind of forget it. That’s why I got so deep into meditation, because of how it felt to listen to the music having taken something to enhance the way on which my mind perceives it. That’s the thing. I have been all this time going round and round with my project so that I can understand what it is all about and I’m crazy with it but now I’m more prepared to say: The meditation retreats are just not for me. I need something else. I need something that pushes the boundaries of what I can bring into the world, and that is creating something awesome where people can just come and listen to music. 

Yes, and this is me spending all this time again to just explore more and more thoughts. It’s crazy how I work. It’s crazy how every day I come here to talk to you about a new idea that I came up with and that now I’m exploring as the means by which I will be able to fulfill the hope that I have inside of building something meaningful that will add a lot of value to the world. And that’s the thing, I don’t know what that is. I don’t even know where to start. I’m just here, exploring what is present, and trying to make my way through it. Trying to understand what is. Trying to get it. I’m just doing my best, you know? And sometimes it is not enough, because there is no clarity related to what the path ahead is. What is it that I’m building? What is it that I’m trying to make my way through in here? I don’t know. I think I’ll never know. And how can I document my journey if I don’t know where I’m walking towards? That’s the thing. I don’t need to know. It is just a matter of trusting what is inside, hearing my heart and what it is telling me, and from there evolving what is going to happen in this new day so that I can make good decisions. What if I approached this writing session every day as the means by which I process what happened yesterday and with that I ended up realizing which are the most important goals for today? By showing up here to write, I’m doing something valuable. I want to build all these systems for people to be able to be creative and stuff, not realizing that the best way by which I can do that is just to show up with my work. It is just to be myself, and in that, motivate others. Give them the space and time and motivation to explore their own creative genius, and build their stuff from there. I’m here to push forward the consistency that is needed to do what they have to do. I’m here to motivate them. To build trust in them. And in myself. That’s the thing. I integrate everything that has happened in my life by just writing about what is present in me. The stream of consciousness does the thing.

Hopefully.

I don’t even know, but it truly doesn’t matter. What matters is that I show up, and with that, end up believing in what is present here. In the way by which this thing is going to transform me. I’m being transformed, and the way on which this transformation is happening is not clear to me right now, in this moment. It is the same as when I’m in deep meditation, I’m not able to realize which is the way by which all this thing is transforming me, but I just deal with it as good as I can. I just let it be. I just allow myself to be transformed, and explore the rest of my life from that perspective. Just feel how it feels. Right now, explore what is present in my whole body by just feeling how it feels. Recognizing that right now I’m a collection of experiences that is manifested as JP, and in that, there is value. And each experience that I go through is a new invitation to become more of myself, and in that being more of myself, I allow me to be transformed. I allow me to express. That’s the beauty of the creative act. Should I stop trying to forge this writing into something different? What if I stopped trying to write a book and I just allowed myself to write whatever comes? Are books important anymore? All the good ones have already been written, and the important part is not the book itself, it is the process by which the book is written. Everything else is just me trying to be someone specific, trying to fit into a particular idea that the world can show me that I need to be someone, and that I have to publish a book for that. What if there are no boundaries to what I can create? What if I don’t give myself a frame? “I’m writing a book”. “I’m building a company”. Those are all means by which I try to fit in the world, fit into a particular way of experiencing it. What if I allow myself to just be, to just explore what is? What if what is needed from me is not defining myself into a particular role, but just opening to what comes? Just being free. That is the thing. I just need to be free, and with that, I will allow myself to evolve. And I am evolving. I’m here trying to uncover all these tools that I can use to help the people that I will work with in the breathwork and not realizing that all of that is just noise, it is the noise that won’t allow me to see the reality that they don’t need all of that. They just need to connect deeper with themselves, and that is the same thing that all this people that I want to build an app for need. I want to create all these technologies so that I can help them do their thing but in reality they don’t need any of that, they just need to be themselves, and leave spirituality for the internal part of it. Or not? I’m remembering the importance of the church, of the sangha, and how the spiritual practice used to be something that you practiced in community. Right now I’m alone in it, and it is time to ask myself: How would a ‘perfect’ meditation practice look like right now to you?

Because what I’m doing now is just sitting on my own, and exploring what is there. I’m very identified with bringing that into the world, so that I can share it with people, but a question comes to mind: What if I just let go of the willingness to share the practice with the world and I just use it as a catalyzer of my own creative process? What if I transform myself into a vehicle of creativity and I use the meditation process to deepen my connection with source so that I can create from a place of more clarity? That’s the thing. That’s what I need, to create from a place of more clarity. To embody that clarity, and with that, let my deepest truth arise. In the quest for bringing more meditation into the world I have lost my own practice, because I’m too identified with bringing more of it. I’m too identified with sharing myself as someone that meditates a lot, instead of using the meditation practice as the vehicle for just being a better human being. What if I allow myself to not speak about meditation for a period of time? How would it feel in relationship to others? I wouldn’t set myself apart in this aspect, because right now I’m doing it. Do I see Jack Dorsey speaking too much about his meditation practice? He doesn’t. It is just a vehicle for clarity, for deeper understanding of himself and what he does, and I think that if I’m able to approach this from that standpoint I will end up feeling better. With a higher degree of clarity. And that feels good. That feels natural. But there comes that pressure that I have inside of building something that will add value to the world, of bringing more of what I already am into the world. Why all the complexity? Why am I so good at overcomplicating stuff? What’s my problem? Is there any problem?

I would like to have a direct conversation with God and ask him: What is the role of all the complexity that arises within my experience? What is it showing to me? I thrive in relationship with other people, I’m really good at asking questions and giving feedback. What is it with the complexity that keeps turning me towards a place of distance from this capacity of helping that I have? That’s the thing that is important for me to have in mind: My truth. How has it been expressed throughout my life. When I went to travel around the world, there are two important things that I need to have in mind. One is that a big part of the travelling had as the spinal chord music, which speaks about the importance of music in my life, and the other is that the first thing that I learned how to say in another language is: Do you need help? I feed myself by helping other people thrive. That’s what I came here for. That’s my thing. And it is only in that understanding that I will be able to move towards doing something that makes me feel complete. 

So I’m all the time talking about the future here. What am I going to do afterwards. What is going to happen then. So now is the time on which I come to myself, and ask: What is present right now in you? I started this book as the means for integrating the process of awakening that I’m going through, how awareness is becoming aware of itself through my experience as a human being, and I forget that. I stay so focused in the road ahead that I forget to come here and acknowledge that this book is a quest towards feeling what is happening within me. Embodying it. Experiencing it fully. And how does it feel to wake up? How does it feel to realize that the experience that I’m having of reality is all of what is? What is it that I bring into the world when I’m able to realize that? What is present in me when I give myself the space for discovering what is there? Or uncovering it. That’s better. It is time to uncover the truth. My own and particular truth. When I speak about “The Truth”, I’m not preaching that my truth is the truth. What I’m saying is that each truth, of each one of us, is equally valid. It is just a matter of realizing which is the aspect of ourself that is speaking when that is being said. It is just a matter of exploring what is your own truth. Asking yourself the question “What is true?” until there is nothing left. That is the exploration that comes right now in this moment of the evolution of humanity. The one within. And I keep trying to build things by which I can help this happen, without realizing that the sole existence of myself is already that exploration. Doing what I already do is what the world needs from me, and it is just a matter of exploring that with more clarity. I’m already complete. I’m already everything that I could ever hope for. I want to build a meditation retreat online, but I’m not able to realize that it is already happening. I’m already living in that meditation retreat, and it is time to embody that so that I can share what comes at the other side with the world. That’s the thing. That is the exploration. That’s what will end up building the reality that will be built. The one of going deeper and deeper using the experience of every human being as the catalyzer of this process. I tend to want to build complexity from the experience that I’m having right now, without realizing that that complexity is not needed. What is needed is simplicity, and the sole fact of realizing which are the ways on which technology will help us to become more of ourselves. 

I see the birds flying around and jumping and I realize how amazing it is to be alive. What if my mission is just to build the coolest place in my town? It has always been. Create the most amazing store of them all, one on which I can share everything that I care about, everything that I love, so that I can bring more and more of my truth into the world. That’s what I need. A place where to be creative. A place where I can be myself. And share that with the world. A place where I can just be me. That is the world needs from me, for me to be myself. That is everything that it takes. Nothing more, nothing less. For me to be myself, and explore what comes at the other side. Share with people the truth, which is my own and particular truth. Nothing more than that, so that I can help them realize that what they have to say is as important as what everyone has to say. We are all in this together, in this eternal exploration of what it means to be a human being. Do you know what it means to be a human being? Do you know which is the beauty of this thing? I don’t think so, yet. I don’t think that any of us truly understands it yet. But I’m here to explore that. I’m here to bring my truth forth so that I can build a feeling of it. I have been doing it all this time. Have I made some progress? I don’t have any clue.

Is there a place that could be spoken of as ‘the coolest place in the world’? How would that place feel like? What would happen in that place? I don’t know, because it depends on which are the things that different people like. For my mother something cool can be completely different than for my brother. So I’m not sure if there is something that could be spoken of as the coolest place in the world, but what my heart tells me right now is that it doesn’t matter, because what matters is that it is the coolest place for me. From there, people that resonate with that will show up, and that will end up having the impact that it will have. What I want to build is a catalyzer towards the new world, and what I have to do for doing that is just opening the world for merging what is happening IRL to what is happening on the internet. To dissolve the boundary. That’s what I want to build, the coolest places of each town, and with that, the entrance points for people to experience life in a new way. In a more open way. A decentralized one. That’s the thing, people don’t even realize which is the importance of this whole game that we are playing, and because of that, they are not able to explore what it takes for us to create that future. What if what I’m building is the web3 radio? That’s the thing. Interviewing people that… Yes. That’s me thinking about the future again. Exploring that future and realizing that it will never come. Because I need to build it right now, right here, and it is just a matter of time until that happens. What happens? That’s the thing. What needs to happen is that the time between the idea and execution is narrowed to zero. I keep dealing with all these issues of framing myself in the best way possible without ever realizing that the important part of this thing is the speed of it. I can change my twitter bio just now and with that have a new thing that I’m doing. I give feedback to your web3 project. The people behind the daily dose don’t have 1000s of followers. They just do their thing, every day, on twitter, and with that they learn about what they are doing. That’s what I can do. Just have a daily space on twitter where I can open the space for me to talk about the project that someone is doing. About the fundamentals of it. That will help me better understand what is going on in the ecosystem, and show the world the interest that I have on it. And with that, learn how to better do what I’m doing. I’m creating the future as I write, and me coming to this paper to write for 88 minutes is still hiding myself behind a wall. What if I used all this time to give feedback to other people about their projects? What if I just showed up for others with my truth about what they are doing? How could that be helpful for them? “Feedback time”. “Do you need help?”. That’s what I have always wanted to do, and it is time for me to just explore what comes. Just give me the time for doing what I better know how to do, which is to be a helper in the road of others. To shine a light upon them, and with that, learn how to build better. That is the most efficient way to learn how to build, directly learning from others, and that is what I have to bring right now. Being taught by other builders how to do the thing. The important thing is to show up, and I’m here to do that. I’m here to explore what it takes. I’m here to realize that the beauty of what I will do comes from connecting with others, and that is the amazing part of everything that I have seen from builders in web3. They all grow by helping each other. It is time for me to do that. And the best way to do it is not by helping 100s of people every day. It is by focusing my full attention into one person, for that person to be able to bring forth its truth. 

So I come here to talk about my process of awakening to my true nature, and this is what I end up talking about. Because what is alive in me is just this, the constant and eternal willingness to explore what is possible if I allow myself to share where I am at with the world. There is no more direct means for doing that than just opening the door to be myself, to share my truth with whoever wants to listen. And that is where the beauty of this thing comes, from the sole exploration of what it means to be here. What it means to be alive. To connect with others. To try to understand what they are doing, what they are going through, so that I can become more of myself. I become more of myself by interacting with people like you, but the truth of that is that I evolve by helping you do your thing. I came to the world to shine a light into the work of other people, and that’s what I know how to do the best. The daily feedback. That’s my thing. Writing whatever comes up from my experience working with what other person is building. Am I the builder? I’m not sure. But I can be the one that gives feedback, and just allow myself to do it as good as I can. I’m the one that can be there for others, I’m the one that can help others become more of who they can become. That’s the thing, this whole writing has been an exploration into what is alive in me when I do my thing, and with that, I become more of myself. That’s what awakening is like, that’s how it feels like. To truly embody my truth, and live from there. 

I start the writing session talking about something and then I run to a completely different direction and then end up somewhere else, mentioning at least 5 times that I’m already comfortable where I am at. Noise, only noise, but that is the thing. It is just what is. That’s where the value comes from, the value from understanding that I’m already doing the work that I need to do by learning how to write like this. Learning how to share my truth, giving feedback to myself. I’m talking about giving feedback to others, and here I’m just giving feedback to myself. The feedback machine. Submit your project and get the most sincere feedback that exists. The truth that comes from me witnessing what your project brought into my existence. It is only the randomness which will allow me to decide which project I’m going to work on. It is only through that that I will be able to build what I want to build. And it is ok. The feedback machine. I love giving feedback. If there is one thing that I do a lot unconsciously it is exploring what I feel is missing in the work of others. Seeing what can be perfected. Feedback time. Every day, 8am est. That’s the thing. Opening up to give that feedback, and learning from what other people are doing. That is how the industry is better understood, by taking the pieces of everyone that is working on it and creating a map. There is no map. These are absolutely uncharted waters. So what it makes more sense is just to explore how it feels to allow myself to be open with how I lost I feel inside here. And it is ok like that. It’s perfect like that. Feedback time is just an exploration into what is. Into what comes. 

How would it feel to become free from that need that I have of sharing my meditation practice with the world and just embodying the consequences that the meditation practice has in my reality? The sharpening of the senses. The better understanding of what life brings to myself through each one of my actions. I need a pfp picture so that I can better understand where I’m going to. So that I can share myself with the world in a different way. One that is not mediated by the image that I have of myself. One that is not mediated by the willingness to be someone specific. I could be no one. I am no one. It is time to embody that, with everything that I have, and with that, become a mirror for the experience of other human being. Open up a twitter spaces and just explore what is shown in the experience of the other person. Just share with that person the truth of what is brought into my experience by theirs. That is what curatory of content is about. Just allowing what I do to resonate with what others do. And for that, I need to be open. I need to evolve fast. I have been for months with this thing inside of wanting to get an otherdeed, and I’m tired of it. I just want to be free, and for that, I need to start building. I need to create also my truth, and having all these conversations with the people that I will interview will help me to better realize what I’m bringing into the world. How am I doing it. That’s the thing. That’s the magic. I have always wanted to have a podcast, and I have had many ideas about it. Infinite ideas, actually. I could speak about anything. I’m just a chameleon. So it is time for me to just start doing it, and what makes more sense to me right now is to talk to builders, because that is what I’m trying to do. Build. If I learn from others, my path will be smoother. It will be easier. And that’s what I want, for it to be smoother. Clearer. I don’t need it to be easy, I have already understood that it won’t be easy. But boy, I want to make it fun. And the way to do that is just jumping into a conversation with random people from around the world and exploring what it takes for us to build the future without having any clue on how it looks like. We are all figuring it up as we go, and that is all that matters. I’m trying my best here to give the best feedback I can, and that’s why I need to hop into these conversations with people.

It will be very interesting to witness how all this process of writing has evolved for me. I have been deep into the maze of my own mind, and now coming out of that maze by realizing which is the way on which I will help the world become more of what it already is. I just need to embody that in a way that makes me feel comfortable, in a way that makes sense. I become more of what I already am by just sharing myself with the world. That’s what I came here to do, share myself with the world, share my thoughts, share my truth. It doesn’t matter how that truth looks like. It just matters that it is. It is being. And that’s the thing. It is being. It is becoming, as I write every word that I write. I tend to fall into this trap of feeling as an imposter, trying to be as good as I can, without ever realizing that everything that I have to say can be valuable. On the internet, people can’t expect to get free feedback in what they do. It just doesn’t make any sense, because the cost of opportunity of people is high. They have to take the time to read and then answer back, and in that, there is a lot that can happen that will make that person not want to respond. Maybe they don’t want to share their voice. Maybe they think that they don’t have anything valuable to say. But that’s the thing, it doesn’t really matter. What only matters is that the thing happens, it is that the word is spoken, however that ends up coming. I cannot think about a better way to learn how to build in web3 than by opening the door to see what other people are doing, and how they are doing it. Thinking that they are doing it because of a reason, and using this as the most efficient curatory of content that exists. The curatory of learning opportunities. By realizing what each other person is doing, and with that, learning more about what you will do. Life is just an eternal feedback machine, with each organism interacting with the one next to it in an eternal cycle of learning from each other. Growing from what each other is doing. And that is the thing, we are just here learning how to do our thing. Just learning what it takes for this thing to be what it has to be. The whole human construct. I’m a feedback machine. I just process what you are showing to me and tell you what was brought into my experience from it. The feedback machine. Thank you for the feedback. Do you need help? The best one I can give to you is my truth. The one that comes from witnessing what is arising in my being as I interact with what you are building. So that you can learn something from it. So that you can become more of it. So that you can free space within yourself of everything that you are not, and with that, become more of what you actually are. That’s the game. Becoming more and more of what you always have been so that you can build from there. So that you can uncover that truth through the act of building. Through the art of building. Of manifesting. Of creating. Building is opening the door for something that was not there before to exist. Building is manifesting your truth and creating an interface by which you can share it with the world. So that you can shape the world from it. Through the act of creation you are bringing something into the world that was not there before. Open up to what that brings. Open up to clearing the noise so that you can explore what is there when there is no more noise. Open up to experience the world from the perspective of your truth. Open up to share with us how your truth looks like. Open up to be yourself, and to manifest everything that you are in the creative act. Leaving you aside, and building something bigger than yourself. That is what the act of creation is about, manifesting something bigger than yourself that people can work with. We are going to explore that more and more in this journey together. That’s why I’m here. To help you become more of yourself. 

To help you manifest your own and particular truth. However that looks like, that is the magic. The magic of being who you are. The magic of allowing yourself to share with us everything that you are. Everything that you have always been. I’m here to explore how it feels to allow that openness to come. The feedback machine, offering my truth to yourself, to the world, GTFOL, it is time to share myself with the world. However that looks like. It is not about becoming enlightened, it is about sharing my truth with whoever wants to listen.
