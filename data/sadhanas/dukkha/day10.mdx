This book is about making sense.

It is the way that I have found helpful to convey my experience, so that it can serve as the means for you to not feel alone. Right now I am in your shows, I’m going through all the struggle that means not understanding what is going on, but feeling from the depth of the heart that there is something that wants to be expressed from there. That there is something that wants to come alive, or wake up, or realize itself. Maybe it is the mind that is telling the stories after all the conceptualization, maybe it is the mind that is telling me that it wants to realize itself, but the mind is already realizing itself all the time as it goes through the process of thinking, and thinking about thinking, and into that eternal loophole. I don’t completely understand where it ends, and if you have read until now you can probably get a grasp on how crazy this whole thing is. I have been throwing towards you words about words and experiences and everything that comes to being in each moment that I sit down to write because it is an important way that I have found to make some progress in the way that I’m relating to this whole process… It is very tough, I won’t tell you something different because it is tough. There are moments where it feels like everything is crumbling, and there is nowhere to grasp, but it seems that those are the moments on which there is more information available.

Yesterday I told myself for the nth time that I would quit drinking. But this time, instead of quitting drinking, I proposed myself to not drink for one year. The relationship that I have had with alcohol throughout my life is very deep, and saying goodbye to it in the day of the first birthday of my daughter is something very symbolic. It feels like a new beginning, today coming to the office to do the work in a more disciplined way. I know what I have to do, but the mind always puts its noise in between and I end up being disorganized. But being disciplined is the means by which I establish the boundaries on which my sadhana will be developed, on which I will be able to use the foundations that I have built for my life until now to create something big from there. It is time for me to create, and the most profound way on which I will be able to do it is by being rigorous with the stuff that I do and how I do it, so that I can create from there. From the place of showing up. The first 5 days of writing here were absolutely powerful, but then came a dip on which stuff in my life started happening, and I was not able to keep it up. I was not able to show up for myself, and come and write what I had to write. It is not that I have to write something specific, it is just that I have to come here and show up to be a witness of what is channeled through me. I just write whatever comes, there is not a clear understanding of the process, it just happens. But for it to happen, I need to take some time to sit down and actually do it. Enter the state of being on which stuff can come. And in the last days I was nt able to do it, but today is a new beginning. I realized that it is very important, both for me and for my family, to give clear messages about what I’m going to d. Not the specifics, but at least the timings on which I will do my work. So today I started with that, and it feels great. I feel much more complete, because I feel that I’m taking care of myself. By showing up to do the work, I take care of myself. I have done a lot of internal work, a lot of stuff to feel better, to heal, but the most important one is the one that is done daily. The sadhana. And my sadhana includes as a big part coming here to do the work. May it be programming, writing, or whatever, but I need to do it to feel good with myself. To bring about what needs to be brought about. And when I don’t do it, I feel like a failure, I feel that there is something that is not in place. SO I better continue as today, doing it, so that the important stuff can come forth. It is only by this that I will be able to bring into my life what I want to bring. It is only by being committed to what I want to do that I will be able to shine.

And you came here, because there is something that resonates with you in this message. There is something deep within you that is calling for something new, for something different, and I’m here right now writing these words for you to know that I’m here for you. All of what I have been, all of what I am, and all of what I have been is here for you. I won’t tell you the clichés of love yourself, you are everything, bla bla blah, because that is the easy part. Knowing it conceptually is the easy part, and the hard one (and most important) is to actually embody all that wisdom. And the only way on which you will be able to embody that wisdom is by showing up to Do The Work. Whatever shape and size it may have for you. But show up, consistently. Consistency is the mother of all the tools that can bring you to success, and you don’t need anything else than that commitment with yourself to see results. You are still young to take that risk. There will always be an opportunity to take the risk of becoming more of who you are. And it is the risk with the higher payment upside that you will find in life. There is no more important work to be done in the earth than discovering the truth of who you are. And for that you’ve got to show up. You have to be on the trenches, and get to know yourself. And the only way on which you will know yourself is by doing the work, because there is where your deepest biases will come up. The samskaras, as we would say in a different languages. All of those are information that is present in our system, and that shows up when we are able to face the discomfort. Each time that you have fear and you end up facing it and you discover that it was not that terrible you will grow your understanding of yourself and the limits of what you can do. And that is an upward spiral, which will bring you more and more of thet understanding the more you walk that road. The more you show up for yourself. Having in mind the power of what can happen, and always giving you the opportunity to reflect on what happened in the process. Life teaches this way, and you are never too young of too old to realize it.
This whole writing piece, this whole Manifesto, as I have called it, is a quest into the understanding of what Dukkha is about, what it will bring into the world. The more I think about it the less clear it is, so the way on which it will happen is by just bringing it into being by being it. To embody everything that is behind the motivation for the project. And that is what I have been doing this whole time, just making my way through the wilderness and finding the means and tools to walk towards the truth. It is all about the truth. The open truth. It is a way of gathering community around this quest, and for us to realize collectively the ways of which that quest is transforming our lives. Because there is an importance of going to a retreat to get a glimpse of what all this thing is, but there needs to be a way on which to bring that about into the everyday life, and that is what matters. At the end of the day, the daily life is what constitutes all of who we become, and if we go to a retreat to end up missing being in the retreat, we end up being deceived from the message that was wanting to be conveyed in it. And the tools for living in the moment are hard to grasp. It has been hard (until now) to live from creative work only, but that is changing. And because of this, the more connected you are from the source, the better you will be at doing this kind of work. The clearer it will be. So my answer to the whole question is building Dukkha, a community of practice that will be about showing up. To Do The Work. And the 21 day intensives are steps towards furthering that commitment, by digging a little bit deeper into the life story of the people that will be part of that journey. So this project is about giving people a frame on which they can rely to Do The Work, a community of practice, and also to build those transformational journeys for them to deepen their capacity to do it. Something like a deep attunement. But all of this are the aspects that will bring about the project, and they are based on my own experience, on what I have found helpful, and on what I want to help people avoid. I am realizing more and more that the ones that need to wake up first are the 18 year olds that are a bit lost, depressed, and unhappy with how the world is looking right now. They feel that there is something different, but in that feeling there is a lack of something that can anchor it to their life.

I can relate a lot of my life story to this also, because there is a constant feeling inside me that tells me that a big part of my life was wasted by being in a place that I did not want to be, doing stuff that I didn’t resonate with. I had a lot of fun, obviously, but that fun doesn’t have any level of comparison with what is going on right now. There is no universe on which it can be compared. It shouldn’t be compared. But what I imagine your life having at least 3 months of Doing The Work before going to college so that you can realize if you want to focus on that for the rest of your life (expressing who you are through the creative act and refining the connection that you have with yourself).

I wrote that and it doesn’t feel appropriate. It is still a conceptual understanding of what waking up is about. And it paints a happy story about it, and it is not at all like that. Adyashanti in the book that I’m reading speaks as waking up as the means the realize the truth, and it being brutal. Not necessarily happy, not necessarily sad. It is just the truth. And from there you can make choices, if you want to do creative work, go to college, whatever you decide to do, but may it be from a place of truth. That is the way forward, and that is the mission of Dukkha, to help this young children in that quest. Are they too young for going into this rabbit hole? Maybe, but the thing related to the way stuff was done in the past is that before you had to go to a specific place to practice, and there was a lot of judgement that came from the outside and that could have put in place a lot of fear. Right now, I’m sure that the communities of practice are going to be held mostly online, and that brings about a whole realm of opportunities related to Doing The Work. You don’t have to care if you are the coolest kid in the school and meditating is ‘nerd’, you can just create an Anon character in the internet and show up. That is all that is needed. No one needs to know what you are doing, because you are just doing it for yourself. Not for anyone else. No one can tell if you are actually doing the work, because it is such a personal thing. And this is the power that the internet brings, that we can connect with people from all over the world and give force to this minorities so that they can be brought up in society with more strength by the people that start actually doing it.

The mission of Dukkha is Polishing the floor for the awakening of humanity. The practices that are proposed now (self inquiry meditation, dyads, creative work, psychedelics, breathwork) are just what is present now as helpful and valuable, but no one can tell is there will be something developed in the future that is more helpful in that process of realization of the truth. Maybe in 5 years we will have a computer program that will be the ultimate truth seeker, and it will be something like The Infinite Jest. In that book, there was a movie that was so entertaining that if you started watching it you could not stop, so you would end up dying. What if that dying actually refers to waking up? What if The Infinite Jest is a film that is so powerful that it has the effect of waking up to your own nature? What if that is the consequence of what humanity is developing now with Artificial Intelligence? What if that is the moment on which computers pass the Turing test?

No one really knows, but what I’m trying to express here is that Dukkha won’t be fixed with the practices that will be done in order to bring about the true self in the 21 day retreats. Each one of those will serve as food for the ones that come later, and each one of them will be a continual iteration. The idea is to always have reflections about what happened, and with them, realize what works and what doesn’t so that we can make all progress together, as a community. The mission is to awaken the world, and there is no place as the internet to build a community of practice. The matrix can hold you and put you down to work for it, or you can step up, Do The Work, and realize the truth of your being so that you are in the seat of the driver. It depends on you. No one can Do The Work for you, but if you start soon, you will already be traveling the road a few months ahead. I don’t really care when you start, I just care to share this information so that it can bring something valuable to you, something that makes you feel wonder…

What would it be to experience life from an awakened state?
Am I good enough for this?
Do I deserve it?

All this questions come from the mind and all its unconscious programs, which tend to help you not feel good. Awakening is about realizing that there is actually no good or bad, there only actually IS. And with that understanding, what comes is freedom. Don’t you want to be free?

I’m speaking from a conceptual level here, not an experiential. I haven’t realized my true nature, so probably that’s why I’m talking from a place that sounds like egocentric. Ego speaks about awakening posing as it knows. But the important aspect of it here is to realize that it doesn’t truly matter if it knows or not, because the important part is that willingness to know that comes from the inside. What needs to be had in mind is that this is a process, on which equanimity is the key. If the mind is relentless right now, accept it and move on. Smile to life and just move on. Don’t blame yourself for being a failure, just embrace it and go a bit deeper into the inquiry of who is the one having those thoughts. It is the spoon that is trying to set you free from jail, and you’ve got to be patient with this process. It won’t happen overnight. You have to Do The Work. That is all that is needed. Show up. Question everything that you perceive as real until there is nothing left. Until there is no one left. Don’t do anything, just be. Just be.

The mind is very foggy, there is a lot of sleepiness going on, and as soon as the eyes are closed to get a better grasp of concentration what comes is a big sensation of wanting to fall asleep. What a curious state that is… Sleeping. Places of wonder that can never be predicted, only experienced. Places of emotions and images that bring about the incredible capacity that the mind has to build up stories with what is present in there. Creating from all the memories something that shows up a message. Dreams are messages from within. What if we learned to tap to that messenger when awake? How would life look life if we were actually dreaming all day long, but with the eyes open? What is life if not a dream on which we have the opportunity to experience what we want to experience? I’m on the process of realizing this right now, because as I write it I’m not sure if it makes any sense. I’m not sure if anything that has been written today makes sense, but it is part of the process. There will be good days, there will be bad ones, the important part is to be here and show up. To share with the page what is coming up, and with that, free space for what will come up later. Every moment is new, every moment is unique.

How do I feel after the first birthday of my daughter? It was great to be better able to connect with the nice people that went to spend their time with us, and give us love. There is something present related to the fact of having been a bit in a rush throughout the day, and not being able to connect deeply with many people. But I had one great conversation, and maybe that is just the important aspect of it. After being the creator of yesterday’s event, I’m better able to realize that the quality is better than the quantity. And that plays for everything. In the interactions in the birthday for example, I had the opportunity to have one very cool conversation that opened up stuff with a person, with which I resonated and could speak my language, and that was very powerful. And it was not present before, because I feel that I can never talk my language because no one else speaks it. So having had the opportunity to talk to her makes everything valuable, and I make peace with the fact that I could not talk to more people in depth. Maybe the goal of the whole thing is not that, is just for people to spend some time together and have fun. Whatever that may mean to them. I enjoyed a lot my little daughter walking in the grass with her nice shoes. She is just about ready to start walking, and it will be so amazing to be a witness of that process. She is so cute… A gift from life. Consciousness unfolding in front of my eyes.

Having the opportunity of building a family is life changer for me. It brings a lot of different emotions, related to my wife, to the family of her, to my family, etc. Yesterday we had a conversation with her in which I opened my heart and told her that the only thing that I needed from her was truth, her truth, and it was very powerful. Because yes, the only thing that I need from her, and from anyone else, is that they are able to speak their truth. Maybe there is people that are wounded for which it is hard, but I know that it is very healing to speak the truth. It is also an integral part of waking up, because for experiencing truth you have to be truth. There is nowhere to hide. And if you are hiding, it will come up in one way or another, and it will make noise until you take that stone out of your shoe. The amount of energy less that you spend is huge. Imagine a moment when you held your truth inside you. How did it feel? Which were the consequences of it in yourself? And in your surroundings? What if you started to share your truth more often, and with that began to realize how good it feels? The biggest boundary that you build for not doing that is thinking that you won’t be worthy of love because you spoke truth. It couldn’t be more away from reality, because most of the times people end up appreciating you for what you shared of you with them. And if what you share with them is your truth, the truth of who you are, how could that end up having long term consequences?

Open up to this freedom, and start speaking your truth, as soon as it is clear. You deserve it, and we all deserve it. The world will be a nice place when we all will have space for our own truth, no matter what it is. That is the future of religion, each of us embodying our own truth, and acting from there. The truth is deep within us, it was buried in there because the greatest quest of them all is the one of discovery of your self. And this quest, no one can do it for you. People can help you with pointers, they have been doing it since the dawn of humanity, but no one can walk that path for you. But we can create a community of practice in which we can share the path of discovery, but ultimately only you can walk it. It is you who has to look within and observe what is going on, leaving the deceiving outside, just staring at what is true. That is all that matters. That is the mission for the next years, to use the transformation that humanity is going through as the means to look within. To explore in the depths of our unconscious and the collective unconscious until there is nothing else hiding. Until there is no one looking. Embody yourself so much that you become no one.

It is time to face my truth. Yesterday when someone asked me what I am doing I answered that I’m creating websites. That is a lie. That is not what I am doing. Why did I speak something different from my truth? What am I hiding? Who am I hiding from? That is a great question, and it is perfect to have witnessed it yesterday. Because it is very hard for me to face that truth, of the difference of what I’m doing from what should be done. But how can I believe in what I’m doing if I’m not able to talk about it? How do I want to bring people about if I won’t tell them from my heart what is being built with my intention? There is a big space for betterment there, and I’m happy to have realized it because it is only by speaking my truth that I will be able to bring it about. It is only by sharing it that people will start to listen. How can people listen if I’m not able to listen myself? My mission is to help in the awakening of humanity, and I’m building a community of practice, gathering people from all over the world that are on that same quest. I’m a magnet that wants to join forces with other seekers, to stop seeking and realize that everything that we were looking for was already here, smiling at our desperate attempts. The seeker needs to give up, and the first step towards that giving up is acknowledging the road that has been travelled until now. Being able to share that with the world, openly, so that people can feel welcomed to join. I don’t like saying that I don’t know something, but now is the perfect time to open up that window and build from there. I only know that I don’t know is the key to success. It is the key to knowing. How can I get some investors for the project if I’m not able to trust in what I’m doing enough to talk about it with someone that cares about me. When is the moment that I start trusting in what I do enough so that I put all my life force in it? That is what I’m doing now, here, by writing down all these words. I’m transforming thoughts and stuff that is going on inside me into something concrete, real, that has an impact because it helps me to better organize everything that is inside. As I write, I process everything. I realize the mistakes that I made, and open up for the possibility of it being different the next time.

What will I answer the next time that someones asks me what am I doing now?

What I’m doing is the most important work of my existing, realizing the nature of my being. I’m walking that road so that I can pave it for the ones that will come after, and I feel that there will be many of them. I’m Doing The Work, so that I can realize my true nature, and with that be an example, a leader, for all of those that will come afterwards. I’m creating a system, a community of people that are in the same path, so that we can help each other in the process. Im building a network of seekers that want to stop seeking, but can’t because their head is on fire. I’m creating the pond with which this fire will be released, and my sense and feeling is that this pond is built upon lighting the creative spark that each of us has inside. I’m lightning that creative spark for everyone that wants to be there for it. I’m making my way the best I can through the present so that I can be the ones that is building the future. And we are all doing our due diligence in that, we are all creating the future. Every moment at a time, each day, with every action. I’m just becoming more aware of my own actions so that I can evolve the way on which I relate to reality, so that I can enjoy it as much as I can. I’m exploring this maze, finding out how cool it is to be alive right now. I’m creating, every second of my existence, more and more presence. Awareness is making its way through myself, and I’m becoming everything that I have always been. I’m becoming the realization of who I truly am. I’m becoming truth, layer after layer of what is not. I’m becoming all what is, and I’m building from there. I’m connecting with people that care. I’m finding places where those people hang out, and I’m enjoying the ride. I’m being a father, knowing about love through the eyes of the mother of my little girl. I’m learning about love by being in love with life, with every circumstance that presents itself, with every feeling, sensation and emotions.

I’m working on my relationship with my parents, so that I can enjoy them every moment just for who they are. I’m learning how to leave aside the conditioning of wanting them to be different. I’m working on understanding my role in my family, so that I can be gratitude, with everything that they have done for me. I’m working on acknowledging this with all my hear, because all of what I am is a consequence of the effort that they did throughout their life. I acknowledge that I am a consequence of everyone that came before, and I’m learning how to embody that gratitude in every one of my actions.

I’m working on my self. I’m working o making everything that is part of my unconscious conscious, so that I can free up the space in there for truth to come forth. I’m working on becoming truth, on being truth in every second of existence. I’m working on narrowing the focus and what I give energy to, so that I can have a sharper understanding of what life is about and where my energy needs to be put it. I’m working on the pathways that carry life-force inside my whole system, so that I can be as efficient as I can with the movement of it. I’m working on building new neural pathways in my system, so that I can be more present with what is, and less present with what should be. I’m working on trusting my voice, so that I an share it with those who want to listen. I’m working on my breath, to realize that every time it comes into y lungs is a gift that nature has given me to experience. I’m working on making sense, and realizing that there is not too much to make sense of, just a lot to enjoy and be present for. I’m working on a book, which will be the manifesto of the community that I’m building. The place where we will go back to, and remind us how crazy the mind is. I’m working on it so that I can make sense of what is going on, and to realize that it feels good just to be sincere. To talk my truth. To share it freely.
I’m working on just being me, without preconceptions, without judgements, without shoulds. I’m working on just being. With all of what I am, with all of what I have been.

That’s what I would answer, that’s what my soul wants to say, but in a moment like yesterday it won’t let it go out because it is not enough. It is never enough. It is never cool enough. It is never interesting enough. I should be earning money. I should be working with more people. I should this, I should that. Those are the stories that are running through the mind as that question comes, and by writing this I make the explicit commitment to be conscious about them, so that I can better realize that hard that I’m making me by not sharing my truth. Both me, and the rest, because all can benefit from my quest of understanding, of my quest of truth. Probably a lot of people won’t listen, it will be just noise, but a lot will, and it will be just what they need in this moments of their life to realize that there is something more than what has been experienced till now.

I’m working on building a system on which all of those will gather. All of those that want to listen. I’m working on developing the means by which I share who I am, refining the message so that it can be better understood. I’m working on bonding humanity, bringing people from all over the world together so that we can truly understand that we are all one. I’m working on developing this true, deep understanding of how we are all the same in the core of our being, and making my best to refine the message to that it can be better spread. I’m working on coming out of the cave on which I have been hiding my whole life. Plato’s cave. I’m working my way out of it, and it feels great out here. There are no boundaries. There are no limits into what can happen from now on.

· · ·

There is a feeling of lightness as all these realizations come forth, and there seems to be a huge correlation between that and the fact that I’m sitting down to write all these words. It is amazingly powerful. How the unconscious works, and how it can become free from all those bondings that won’t let the ideas flow. I’m working on becoming flow. A force of nature. I’m working on becoming unstoppable. From within. I’m working on sharpening the most important tool that we have as human beings: The Mind. I’m working on refining my understanding of the mind, so that I can share it with people afterwards. I’m working my way towards the understanding that everything that has been in place until now will fall, and that there is no way on which this will be stopped. I’m working my way into the undemanding of my role in this whole process, or more than understanding it, just playing it. I’m working to embody my role in the process by which awareness becomes aware of itself. God realizes itself. The universe realizes itself through me.

I’m working on becoming.

I’m working on just being.

I’m working on love.

I’m working on trust.

I’m working on fearlessness.

I’m working on myself.

I’m working on letting go.

Those are things that are present in this system in this moment, and these words are an exploration into that. Into all that is through me. I am a window into the infinite. I am the infinite. I just don’t know it yet. But it doesn’t matter, there is no rush. Time is just an invention of the mind. Space time is doomed, as a wise men would say. There is nothing such as space time in the absolute reality, it is not true. It is just an aspect of being, of mind, and it is not present in the absolute way.

There are so many things that I write about that don’t make sense, but I really don’t care, because it doesn’t matter. There won’t be judgments, because they don’t help at all. They give some keys, which I appreciate, but I prefer just doing and realizing what happened.

· · ·
That is how the universe evolves, that is how I evolve. In the beginning, if a human ate the poisonous berry, they all would know that it was poisonous because of him. Now, if a person makes 1000 mistakes on twitter, he can share what he has learned and you can learn from him. It gets faster and faster, but the pattern is always the same. There will always be stuff that we have to try and make mistakes and then pass those learnings to the ones that come later, that is just part of how this whole game works, that is just how life is arranged, with this iterative aspect of building itself, making and correcting mistakes all along the way. That is amazing. Life is amazing.

I working on being free of wanting to know it all, and focusing just in the fundamentals. I’m working my way to being a human being, it has been quite a challenge.

This is me, this is all of who I am, what I am, and this words are being written with the heart. With the willingness to help, but not knowing completely how to do it. With the willingness that just by being I help. With the acknowledgment of all of who I am. That is all that matters.

Who is the one that is sleepy?

Who is the one that is in a rush?

Who is the one that is rough with his father?

Who is the one that judges?

Who is that noise inside the head?

Who is the one that feels lost?

Who is the one that feels insecure?

Who is the one that is impatient with Mila?

All of those are aspects of that which I’m not. I just haven’t realized it yet, so I feel completely identified with them and experience life as if I am all those aspects. But I’m not.

I am the one that is willing to experience truth.

I am the one that is eager to realize itself.

I am the one that has been looking through this eyes this whole time.

I am the one that laughs.

I am the one that hugs.

I am the one that shows up.

I am the one that Does The Work.

I am the one that is present in the details.

I am the details.

I am.

I am.

I am.

Iam.

Im.

Om.

Ommmm….

I am the music.

All those are aspects of what I can conceptualize as being me. But I’m far beyond those conceptualizations. I am not conceptualizable. I am beyond concepts. I am waiting for you. I have always been.

I am the gratitude.

I am the peace.

I am the being.

I am what is expressed through you.

I am this words, and what is hidden behind them.
