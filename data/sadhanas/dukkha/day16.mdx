Facing a blank page is brutal. There is a feeling inside present as if there was nothing to be said, nothing worth your time as a reader, and a lot of doubts about the process. Am I bringing myself into another void inside my own mind? Is this another way on which I trick myself, imposing me a strict thing to do so that I can be busy on that and not completely present? It is quite a challenge not to become like a robot, even doing this kind of work that is very much connected to my heart. There is that sensation of it being like ‘something that needs to be done’, and that is the one that I will have in mind as the information that I need to make some progress in my understanding of myself.

The last year specifically I dove into a very deep and consistent yoga practice, with the clear intention of evolving my relationship with myself, and it was always hard for me to deal with each class as a ritual. As something that was going to capture the attention of every part of me. I just went for it, I just did it, and a lot of the times it ended up being something mechanic. I hate to say it, because it is hard for me to deal with it. I knew that I did not want it to be mechanic, but I also realized as I was doing it that I was not succeeding too much in that effort. It seemed very hard for me to fully experience each class, not thinking that I was doing something on the long term, and that it was something like a stepping stone towards a particular goal. The goal? It doesn’t really matter, the important part is how my consciousness is set apart from what is going on in the moment because of a fixation on the consequences that what is being done will have in the future.

As I sit down and write these words, there is something shown related to that. I do my thing, end up sitting down and establish the relationship with my work so that I can start. What are the things that surround this experience of sitting down to write that give it the meaning that can produce this feeling of ‘not just doing it because it is what needs to be done’, but doing it because I care? Because there is a deep feeling inside me that one day these words will be read by someone, and that person will find a particular resonance in them that will help her in any way. That is the aim of what is being written, but as the whole process of writing is established there is no clarity related to this being the ‘correct way’ to do it.

And there we go back to the correct way. There is no correct, there just is. But the thing that makes noise in my mind is: Am I just pointing myself and everyone that reads into a direction that is not good for them? I hope not, but it is hard to stop it now. I already created this frame of action for myself and as a help for you so it is time to embrace it and realize that there nothing more important that I should be doing than this. And the word good is there present again, making its announcement that there is something that needs to be compared to. Would it be better to be doing something else? That is part of the shoulds that we are trying to light in here, trying to make them conscious.

There is a lot of sleepiness going on inside here. When going up from the bed there was a deep and intense craving for having more sleep, for giving myself the permission to sleep a lot more. That’s what I will go and do. Sleep a little bit more. This is the moment on which I stand and give myself the permission to be as not as disciplined as I could be because there is a need that my body is expressing to me that needs to be fulfilled. This kind of relationship is something that I’m learning to deal with, because it would be easy to just stay here and push through it, but my mind tells me all these stories about it wanting to rest. Should I stay or should I go. That is the big question. The bed is cozy and warm, but all the stories of success that have been heard involve pushing through times like this, being resilient in the face of what shows up. But going there will be more information to myself, because I will realize what it brings to actually give up that unconditional discipline and just give me the space to sleep. I’m not giving up, I’m just taking care of myself.

(…)

So yes, I went there to sleep for an hour and it was hard to do it. The mind was there, making its noise. I arrived to the bed and there was no more sleepiness and I was like: Really? And now I’m here and it is back an everything is weird and it is tough. I arrived to the bed and my little baby was there and I was like why am I doing this whole thing, why always taking the hardest road possible? Is this really what should be done in this moment? That is why all this thing is being built, because the suffering is just too much, the inability to be grateful for what is and not expect something different is too much, I’m tired of it and I want to get out of this maze and this is the way that my heart is telling me but it is very hard because I don’t know how to make the progress that I need to make in order to feel good and my mind is telling me that I’m alone in this thing but it is not like that because yesterday I had an amazing call with a friend that truly cares about me and she is truly guiding me in this path so I’m not alone, those are only stories that are told inside, but they are not part of the reality.

This is an important moment, and I’m doing what I’m doing to help. It is the most that I could do after everything that has happened in my life. But yes. Am I building another nightmare for myself on which I impose to me that I have to show up in order to evolve or is it truly what I need to do? The mind, more and more, running around with its noise. Always that noise making its appearance. It is never never never enough. Where is the trust? Where is the acknowledgment that what I’m putting out to the universe will be rewarded in any way? Am I doing it because there will be a reward? Am I unconsciously looking for that love that I have discovered is what my soul craves for? Is this my way of seeking love from the universe? It seems like a new way that I have discovered it. A new system. I build for myself love systems, which aim for me to feel love. I’m desperate for that love.

—

There is something that I have been doing this past time sometimes and now it is the moment for me to better realize what it is about, and why I have added all this noise. So I go through my morning meditation, and I decided that I want to share it with the world so that more people can meditate. But just adds more noise into the thing because I’m openly recording myself to broadcast to absolutely no one in YouTube, and I’m bringing in what comes after doing that. Today was the editing of the video for publishing, so that afterwards I could check out how it was recorded to realize that it was not of good quality at all. It was just noise. And I keep doing this kind of things, sharing myself as noise, because of not being able to polish my stuff enough.

I think that this transition that I’m doing to share my voice with the world needs to take into account all these live streams that I have done, and all this sharings with the internet of those videos. Is it worth it to broadcast a video that no one will ever watch? Where am I going with that?

Do people really need to sit down to meditate with me like that? I don’t think that that is what my audience wants/needs, but the problem is that I don’t even know who my audience is. Who keeps coming is depressed people, but are they the ones that will go on and stay with that horrible YouTube video with bad audio for one hour? Why would they do that instead of just shutting down their computer and doing it on their own? It makes much more sense that way. And I don’t want to force anything, but I have this like constant craving to share everything that I do, and all of what I am with the world. I share my breathwork practice so that people can see that I Do The Work. I want them to acknowledge that, and to be witness so that they can be inspired by it.

But that is not what people want. It is just a matter to see the response that I have got from what I have done. There are always 0 persons watching the streams, and the tweets that I put up have very few responses. It is always me trying to force something in people that they don’t really want, and I’m wasting all my energy in that. Even writing this book, is it something that people really want? Am I writing for someone or am I just writing for myself? It seems that I’m writing just for myself. That everything that I have done is for myself. The Open Source Factory? It was just for myself, running around in circles, inside the maze of my own mind. I’m writing to make sense. That is really what I’m doing. Making sense of all this thing that is happening through me. And how can I explain it better than just writing like this? It is what comes up more naturally, with less friction. I could be directing my speech towards a particular person, but it is hard for me to do it that way. I really don’t know how to do it. I just want to express what is inside me, and the most natural way of doing it is just creating this flow of words that comes out as what you are reading.

I know that it is better to write as if you were talking to a specific person, but for me it doesn’t work that way. And I know that it has an impact like this, because there is people that have read it and have found value on what I have done. That is the thing, trusting enough in what you have to offer so that people can find that value from there. I trust what I’m doing, and because of that, I write it the way it comes. That is how I do my thing, and the problem that I have is that I don’t have a particular audience that knows that I exist. I have not done my due diligence properly, and that has me in a place of writing into the void, just throwing stuff out there without making too much sense of it. It is very hard for me to communicate what I have inside in a way that makes sense to people. I create websites and they are not understood. I create gatherings and no one shows up. There is obviously something that I’m not doing properly, there is a lack of connection between me and the people that I want to reach out, and that lack of connection is what determines how alone I am in what I do. But the thing is… Do I want to be connected to them truly? Do I want to listen to what they have to say? Or I’m just in my track of thought here, as always, thinking that my truth is the only truth?

And the big problem related to this is that I have managed to find out THE truth to strive for. Like the ultimate truth of them all, the truth of our existence as human beings. So what is that about? How can I reach out to people while I hold this truth as the means by which I interact with them?

The answer pops up as obvious: The truth is just each truth that exists. There are as many truths as human beings.

I need to take care of them. I need to hold the space for their evolution. I need to be truly interested by them, so that I can grow with the understanding of their world. I need to engage in conversations, to participate in communities, to share my voice. To ask questions. That is what I like doing the most… Asking questions. I need to do that more often, because on the last days I have only taken care of what I do, my side of the thing. What I publish. My content. My writing. And that is not how it works in this world anymore. What I need to do is create a compelling profile and start interacting more with people. Start asking questions. I will set up a goal of 10 questions every day. Show up with curiosity, with wonder, and grow in that sense. That is my mission, and each question that I ask will open the window for that person to come to my profile and be interested by what I do there. That, and only that, is what is going to help me grow and create an audience for myself. Before I went away for travelling I was doing it consistently, and then I stopped because I did not have internet, but now I have to come back to it. Not because of the growth of the thing, but because I really need it. I need to challenge myself in the arena, in the place where people interact, in the place where the stuff is going on. I feed myself in conversations with other people, and as long as I do that consistently I will learn better how to grow as a human being in this modern age.

It is important that I care enough about how I share myself to the world so that I don’t publish all that shitty videos that speak about who I am, but in a manner that is not proper for a good understanding of it. Even from myself. How you see you is how they see you. I see me in those videos as a person that doesn’t take into account how he looks, and that is the message that I’m broadcasting to the world. Because when I sit down to meditate for 1 hour broadcasting it in youtube it is powerful for me, but for the viewer it is shitty. It doesn’t speak quality, and it doesn’t matter how much quality there is in my meditation process. The important part is how people see the message that is conveyed through how I present myself to the world, and it is important to take that into account so that I can grow what I do into something that people will care about.

I can see now that this is a pattern of behavior that has been present throughout my life. When I used to go out more, and party a lot, I didn’t care about how I looked really. I always weared the same clothes, and for me it was ok like that. It was not something that I invested time or energy in. And now I have the same problem, because conveying my message depends on me being able to be clear and concise, and present myself in a way that is appealing to the other person. And I’m not having that impact, at least that is the feeling that I have related to the situations that I put myself in. But I guess that what is showing up as I write this is that I don’t need to be the one that creates those kinds of things, at least not now. It is not the time. I don’t have to invest time and energy in building those kind of things because it is a waste right now. If I create an online meditation and no one shows up, it is because of something. If I create a breathwork session and the only two people that show up are my wife and my best friend, maybe it is because I don’t have enough trust from the people that are being part of the network, and because of that, I don’t have their attention. Trust and attention, that is the game, and I have not been playing it correctly. I’m building this whole thing as a enormous maze, and perhaps I’m jumping over some steps. Because right now I’m working with the breath, I’m training to be a breathwork facilitator, and that is the step that comes at this stage of the journey.

I know the road that lies ahead, but it is important to stay quiet with it. How is my breathwork practice going to be impacted because of me doing the thing that I do? What if I start making one good quality video each week so that I can start building an audience with that and actually adding value? And I say I will write a book and I spend all this time writing the book but I think: Is it really adding value to someone? How is this thing making an impact in the world?

But yes, the doors open from me doing this, there is a deeper understanding of myself as I open up to write a bit more, and perharps that is what I need to make progress. Be able to distill the parts of it that are more appealing into stuff that I can share in different places, and with that, start growing. Start building who I am on the internet. Step by step, but being intelligent. I need to be intelligent, and I haven’t been until now, because I’m throwing an infinite amount of puches to kill my enemy, but it will never work like that. There needs to be a tactical approach to this growth, to this way of doing things, and that is what is being discovered in this writing.

I know that my craft is writing, and I know that the way on which I hone my craft is by sitting down and writing for 4 hours every day. That is the commitment that I did with myself, so that I could bring out of me what needs to be brought out. That is my challenge. To show up and Do The Work every day, to realize what comes, and to explore from there. I owe that to myself, because this is an amazing way that I have for thinking. I have to be sincere. I truly have to be sincere with this thing. Writing is the way on which I think, and opening up the window of the unconscious by letting it all out is just the means by which I’m able to better connect with myself and with who I am.

And I need to think these thoughts, and need to have these realizations, because of everything that I’m going through. I know that my daughter will read these words one day and realize that this was the moment in my life when something big was happening. And besides everything that could be going on in any place of my being, this is the moment on which I decided to write my first book. Holy shit, my first book. I have always thought as myself as a writer, and this is the first time that I actually embody it in a way that makes sense. It is the first time that I commit to do the work enough so that a body of work like this can be produced. I need to honor it. I need to honor this commitment. I have been showing up for 16 days until now, every day Doing The Work, and it is time for me to acknowledge that. Holy shit, it is a lot.

And what comes also is the recognition that this is the beginning of a journey. It is the journey of being able to express who I am and what I care about through words. The big commitment of being open to be whatever I decide to be. Of being myself. Of just being myself. Writing my first book is opening myself to that commitment, and realizing that there is a world of opportunities ahead. Is it a good idea to publish it as a book and not a paywalled Substack post every week? Does it even matter? Nope, it doesn’t matter because I can do both. Part of what is being written here can be translated into a blog post, and I can start building my content around this whole journey of discovery of who I am.

——

I will never know how my creations will look like in the future, I never know what is going to be written in the next line, and that is a great opportunity for exploration. In this moment there is a certain feeling of unsatisfactoriness inside me related to the way that I am writing, and a expectation that in the future, as I go deeper in the craft, that feeling will become something way more expansive, way more connected to my heart. But for now it is the way it is because I’m not fully open in this moment, and it is ok like that. I acknowledge it, I feel it completely, and I move on from there. It is part of the game. I’m beginning to get used to what this thing is about. I remember in the book The War On Art when Steven talks to his neighbor about finally finishing a book, and he answered back: So when are you going to start the next one?

This is an ongoing process, that is just getting started. This first book is only the beginning of something new, something different, a new way of being, a new way of creating. I will acknowledge every thought, sensation and feeling that is present because it is all what is now, and one day it will be extremely value to come back and read the maze of words that I have written today and tell myself: That is who you are. These were the troubles that I was having in that moment to share my voice. To make sense of what was coming so that I could write something that makes sense. I will hold this words with respect and pride, because they are the ones that are helping me become who I will be in the next moment. I hope that they become an inspiration for you also because there is nothing like just being, without caring too much about what happens at the other side. There is nothing like just sharing your creative voice and letting it shine through your object of creation. May it be anything, but just let it flow. Let it be there, let it be manifested, translated from the depths of your being into this reality so that we can all enjoy it and share what doing it brought into your life. That is the game that we are going to start to play more and more, as people are able to open up to what is at the other side of being curious for what you have to offer. For what you can create- For how crazy you are.

Be open to be the craziest person in the room, please. We need it. It is the best gift that you can give us. And your children will also appreciate it, they want you to be crazy. They want to experience you completely.

Today I came walking to the office walking through the garden of my grandmother, and she has a lot of tress and plats that are in the flowering stage. I was walking a bit in a hurry, and then I realized that and started walking slowly, sinking in what was going in around me. The amazing expression of beauty that is produced in spring, as each flower makes its way through the air to reach out for the sun and open up their heart to what is there. Each flower was a different experience, on a different point of their development, and each with its own story. I realized the importance of slowing down and just be a witness of nature, of what was going on there. Of the harmony between bugs, snails, raindrops, sunlight, everything. Being able to appreciate the place where I live and be open to receive everything that it offers is something that I need to remind me about every day, because it is very easy for me to forget it and take it for granted.

How much of what you have in your life you take for granted? How much do you take life for granted? As soon as you go back and start to realize the amount of miracles that needed to happen so that you could be here, what starts coming is a deep appreciation of what is. Or at least the willingness to walk that way. As I wrote that my mother came into mind, and the incapacity that I have had in the last weeks to connect with her in a deeper level. Is it that I take her for granted that I’m not able to give her what she needs from her son? What am I not seeing that makes me take her for granted? She is the one that gave me life, and it is time for me to realize that and be grateful for it.

The consequence of realizing that you take something for granted is gratitude for it being part of your life. It is an appreciation for it being there. What was the last element of your life that you took for granted and you lost? How has that teached you about who you are?

But that is the eternal mystery of being alive. You don’t know what you have until it is not there anymore. That is the theme that repeats itself over and over, and there doesn’t seem to be a clear understanding of how to go through that process. How to not take things for granted. And the answer to this that comes right now is that the way is being present. By being present, you embrace what is with everything that is there, you sink it in completely. It becomes part of who you are in a way that is not filtered by the mind, and that creates a flow of energy that is ever present in you and translates itself into gratitude.

It feels like I’m just talking nonsense here. I’m trying to organize my thoughts in a way that is conducing to create something that has any kind of value to you, dear reader, but it is not coming through. I guess that it is a good moment for offering ourselves a space of silence, of contemplation. Of witnessing what is present in our life that we take for granted. If you didn’t take it for granted, how would your relationship to it evolve? How would it be different?

(…)

The word that better describes this whole proces is unleashing. It is as if there was a small bird hatching out from the egg that has given it the possibility to exist, and each word that is being written is a small crack in the egg so that the resistance is broken. Or maybe that is not a good way of putting it, because what will happen with resistance is not that it is going to be broken, it is going to be understood. Dealt with. I know from the masters that it will always be there, it is part of life, but it won’t be in the driver’s seat. It will be there, making its noise, doing its thing, but being helpful for what is wanting to be achieved. For what is being created. Let resistance be the force behind the actions, because it is what speaks to me about an avenue that needs to be explored. As soon as there is some resistance present, there is an opportunity to show up and inquiry into the information that it is bringing me about myself. Every circumstance is a window into a deeper knowing of who you are. Always have that in mind. Everything that you go through, every moment of your life can be the means by which you deepen your connection with yourself, just by being a witness of how you react to it.

Let this be a continual process. It is not that you will read this and start realizing how everything that you go through impacts you and the information that it gives you, but have it as a pointer. As something that is present in your mind. Probably in most circumstances you won’t even remember this, but as you go through the process of Doing The Work, you’ll start to become more aware, you’ll start to catch these glimpses of clarity on which you’ll say: So this is what he was meaning when he was talking about the resistance. For example, each time that you have a conscious relationship with what the word procastination means, inquiry into what you are avoiding by not sitting down to Do The Work. I’m going through that myself now, as I take more and more time to continue writing these lines. I realize how harmful that is for the whole process, because there is a thread that is lost. I knew what I was talking about, I was giving it all my energy, and now it is kind of lost.

So what am I avoiding by not being focused in here?

What comes up when I realize that I don’t have a particular clue about what to write. Yesterday was an important day, I started sharing my work publicly with an opportunity to buy the book. This means that I have commited to do this for the next months, and it feels scary. I felt like an imposter, charging money for something that is not even complete. I have written for 16 days, but who tells me that I will be able to do it for the rest of them? Will I have something to write about? Will I be running in circles and repeating the same things over and over again? Who knows, but the thing is that the people that sign up for this journey know that beforehand. I told them that this is not ready, and the rules. And they signed up for them, because they trust me.

They trust what I can be, and what can be created through me. It doesn’t really matter what it is, the important thing is that it is. But I’m avoiding those feelings of a failure by procastinating, because that has been everything that I have done always. Pushing me down and making me think that I’m not enough. That I’m not worthy of attention. And I think that those sensations will never go away, because it is part of how my ego defends me. I always remember that story about a famous singer that each time that he went into stage vomited. He was scared as hell. But he still showed up. That is what I’m teaching myself to do here, just to show up, with whatever I am, with whatever I come up with.

And my mission in that process it to help you realize that you can do the same. There is nothing special in myself that tells that I’m a person that can do this kind of thing. That is what we have gotten wrong about creativity. Society thinks that it is about inspiration. It is not. It is about just sitting down and Doing The Work. Being consistent about it. Caring about it. That is everything that matters, because the results will compound over time and you won’t even realize when your body of work will speak for itself.

That is the magic of it. It is accessible to us all. There is no special pill, or special thing that makes one person more readily available for being creative. Yes, there are some people that can afford more of it because they have better life circumstances, but in this world we are having more and more opportunities to Do The Work, no matter how much time it is. If you don’t have enough, just start for 30 minutes every day. Just be consistent with it, and be open to the transformation that will happen within yourself. If you are reading this, I invite you to devote 30 minutes every day to create something that didn’t exist before. I repeat: It doesn’t matter what it is. Just do it. Open up to a better understanding of who you are by doing it.

We have been trained to think that this is not the way, because in schools they used to give us grades for how good our work was. This builds up a notion of comparison that is what ends up being the way on which we value creative work. We think that something is ‘better’ than another thing, as if there was a fundamental measurement device that commanded the whole thing. It doesn’t matter anymore. What matters is the heart that you put in the thing. The amount of presence that you bring into what you are creating. Because it is not about who will receive what you create, it is about how transformed you are throughout the process.
The world will receive it from there. That will be the impact that it will have, because the fact that you are a different person after facing the void of creating from nowhere definetly has an impact in the world. You may not be able to notice it directly, but it will. At least you will have something new to talk about. Do you remember how you felt when you talked about that time that you did something for 10 days in a row? Do you know how it feels to do it for 100? Show up for yourself, and realize it on your own experience. Nothing that any person says can be translated into your own experience, because what comes up is different for each one of us.

We all have our different demons, our different patterns of action, our different ways of existing, and it is important to let all of those arise just for yourself. No one can do that work for you. It is for you to witness, and for you to better understand where you are coming from when you act. The biggest present that you can do to yourself in this lifetime is dive deep into who you are, into the understanding of everything that you are, so that you can experience life from that understanding. It truly is a gift, and as you start travelling that path you are transformed.

Talking about addictions, I think that this is one of the most intense ones that you can have. That craving to go deeper, to get to know yourself better. Do you remember that kid that was staring back at you in the mirror when you were a young? Do you remember those experiences that traumatized you when you were growing? Do you remember all those happy moments on which your heart didn’t fill in your chest? There is a common denominator in all of those experiences: YOU. You have always been present in all your life, and all of the circumstances that you have gone through converge into what you are right now, as you read these words.

I invite you to inquire deeper into that concept of you that you have within, and ask you: Who is the one that feels represented? Who is the one that has been with me throughout this lifetime? Ask yourself these questions until there is no doubt. Close your eyes and witness what comes up. Those memories, the sensations and feelings associated with those memories. What is present in your body right now. Open up to what is present, right here, right now. Open up to the truth of being, which is that the only thing that is real is what is happening now. That is the truth. And it is a mystery that lies deep within each one of us. This book is an invitation to navigate that mystery together.

I want to talk a bit now about the role that psychedelics play in this whole game. I see them as atomic bombs to the self structure, that tear each piece apart in a way that is absolutely different than anything that you have experienced before. They are major pointers, that let you know the way to move towards. If you don’t have any experience with them, or with meditation, or with anything, probably most aspects of what I have been talking about may seem alien to you. I may be talking nosense.

And that’s where the leap of faith needs to come from, because I truly know where I’m talking from. I’ve been there. I know that there is something fundamentally different to our existence as human beings that what we have been used to, and psychedelics open up the window into that realm in a way that is more efficient than anything else. And that is what is needed right now. A shattering of the structures that have been in place, so that we can build more conscious ones. More connected with the essence of who we truly are. More connected to what we came here to do.

It is not about transforming ourselves into something different from what we are, it is about evolving ourselves into what we have always been. Psychedelics show us the road. They are not the road per se, the main thesis of this book is that the way is a perpetual exploration into the self by tools that are part of yourself in every moment, mainly meditation, breathing and creativity, but for those changes to take place there needs to be a shift that may be catalyzed by an atomic bomb. Maybe that is the nuclear war that every one is talking about. It is time to nuke ourselves without mercy, to see what stays afterwards. I’ve been there, and there is nothing more freeing than surrendering to everything that just is. I’m here to hold your hand as you go through the same and tell you: It’s all going to be ok.
