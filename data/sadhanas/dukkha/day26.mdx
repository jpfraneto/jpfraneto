This writing is an exploration into the void. Into what is left behind my thoughts after having experienced the work that has been published to the world by Eric. I came across his work yesterday, and there is a deep resonance present in me related to it. That’s why I read parts of it with intention, with all of what I am, so that I could bring it towards the aspect of my unconscious experience so that it can be brought up during this writing-thought process. I’m giving the command to my rational brain to step apart at this moment, so that the truth can come forth. My own truth. My own digestion of where I am at right now, after all the steps that I have walked in my own experience as a human being.

Every one of those steps is a building block that brings me into what I am right now, and into the capacity that I have for creating reality from that place. Because yes, every word that is written in this moment is an aspect of where I am at right now. It is the translation of the present moment through the lens of this experience. It is how consciousness has shaped reality through me as an individual, and I write in the hope of being able to use that shaping in a way that is conducent to a pure expression of consciousness through it. I leave myself at the side, so that what remains talks.

And yes, that is what is present. The necessity for building systems of culture that enable that flourishing of the individuals through the creative expression. That is something that I miss from everything that I have read. I deeply resonate with the need for building new means of working out our experience as human beings, but how those means are translated into the daily experience of the normal worker that doesn’t even have money for buying the bread to feed his family? How can that individual be actualize so that he can be the means by which more of what we are can be expressed?

I am part of the lucky few. Life has given me the means for me to live at my own expenses, without any material need at all. Everything that I need from that standpoint has already been provided, and that is the place from which I think, from which I design. I have an amazing and supportive family, I have a beautiful and healthy daughter, and from there I’m able to realize that the biggest aspect of what I can aspire to is realizing the truth of my being.

But what happens to the gardener that was put into the hospital the other day and had a surgery on which he didn’t have any piece of opinion because of his lack of education?
What happens to the priest (friend of my grandmother) that commited suicide yesterday next to the church?
What happens to all of those people that are buried into depression and that don’t see the way out?
What happens to all of those people that go back to their poor houses in the metro finding in the eternal noise of facebook an escape to their own pain, to the misery of their life?

How can this healing reach them?

They are the majority of the ones that are alive right now, and it is through them that the biggest changes can happen. Historically, for them religion has been that escape. At least where I live, there is a tendency for poor people to trust in religion as the means for them to be saved. It is like the excuse that life gives them for their misery. And I guess that that has been a major role that religion has played until now. To build those kinds of individuals into the ones that follow the rules, the ones that do their thing because they just have to do it. They don’t have any other option.

But do they really don’t have other option?

What I’m aiming towards with all this questioning without myself is: Do they really don’t have any other option?

How can we co-create that option?

What is most present in me usually is that the means for freedom are inside the word. They are free.

If you want to have better health, east less: fast.
If you want to have a deeper connection with yourself, meditate, breathe.

I’m sure that life cannot be this unfair. Because of having been born where I was, I was able to take a plane to Canada and go to the deepest meditation retreat that I have gone. But how can the connection with spirit be available only to those that can afford that? Of course not. It can’t be. How can it be that the connection with spirit is available only for those that have enough money to pay for it? Nope, it can’t work like that. Life is not unfair. It is showing us the way, and the only way in is through.

I think that creativity plays a major role in this whole game. Most of those people when they are in the train are consumers. They are feeding their experience with what other people are doing, they are just being entertained. This doesn’t bring anything particularly good to them more than noise. Numbness. They are comfortably numb, because they don’t know any better.

How can the connection with spirit be fostered for those who don’t know how to read?
What is the place from which they are the ones that evolve, that become self-sovereign individuals?

We need a shift in perspective to how we relate to reality, and I think that a major entering point to this can be through the people that are depressed. There is a big avenue in them, because they are growing in number, and a big part of those are desperate. They don’t know the way out. They are absolutely identified by their ego, and that makes them think that that is the only thing that exists. They are at the end of the spectrum of identification with ego, and self-sovereign individuals are at the complete opposite. But is it truly a spectrum? Is is truly at the other side?

I don’t think so. What my heart and intuition tells me is that it is more of a moebius tape. I’m certain than the most depressed a person is, the closer she is to awakening. The ego structure is so solidified, so strong, that it is easier for that one to be dropped out than for mine, for example. My ego structure has been bullied a lot by that aspect of me that knows it isn’t true, and that’s why this battle inside me has been going on for such a long time. I know that there is something else, but I don’t know how to look for it. And I keep looking and searching for that realization, and I’m absolutely trapped in that maze. That is what happens when you have enough time to deepen your relationship with this whole aspect of realizing your true self, you end up in this maze, putting all the effort into the seeking. And what needs to happen is that the seeking must be dropped. Easier said than done.

But for this people that don’t have any idea, any clue about this whole ego construct and awakening and enlightenment and stuff, my heart tells me that it is way way much ‘easier’. It is just about realizing the means by which it can be done at a civilization scale. Which is the set of practices that can be developed in order to wake up a random dude that is in the metro going back to his house after a tough day at the factory? That is what we need to search. That is what needs to happen. Because as soon as we reach a critical mass of awakened people, it will become an exponential process. For someone to wake up in presence of an awakened individual it is much easier, so the key will be how to develop this kind of system. That is why, in my eyes, the approach has to be from the ground, from the very ground, up. And that is the major challenge. How can those people wake up? And how can they stay awake? What comes after that?

An explosion of creativity. And society needs to develop the means for that creativity to be used as a means for generating wealth, so that they can make a living out of their new way of living life. At this moment, there is no space for that. We are into the trap of consumption and mass production and lack of quality and all what is present now. What comes at the other side? I don’t think we can build up that system from the outside. It needs to be developed from the inside. If you go to a farmers market, they know how to do their thing. They have been bartening all their life. And here we come, modern citizens from the big cities, trying to reinvent the wheel. How much of that is our own ego of being the saviors of the world? And I’m inside that bag also. I’m very deep in it. A huge part of me thinks that it is my duty to develop the technology, the means of communication, for that transformation to happen. Because of everything that I have been given, it is my mission. For all my self-actualization, it is my mission to actualize other human beings. Am I deep into my own trap? I wonder. I ponder it.

I come into the internet and read all this amazing things that are being developed to heal the world, and then I go back to that gardener and realize how far the way on which he lives is to what is being developed in what I was reading. And I wonder. How is this gap closed? How is this new way of thinking materialized in a way that it impacts the biggest part of the population?

Because yes, creating a new culture is an amazing idea, I’m all into it, but how does that culture impact the person that is watching the news to avoid feeling what she has inside? How can that person truly be healed so that consciousness can arise through her actions? How can we bring healing to the moms and pops of the world? How can I help heal my grandmother, who is a rock which has never shared any emotion with me? How is are all the insights that I have inside translated into a way of doing, of creating, of manifesting, that has an impact in the life of all this people that will never go to a transformational retreat? Are we tackling the problem from the right side?

Those are questions that arise clearly within me, because I truly don’t see how this message can be translated into their language. And I spend a long time with them. I ask them questions, I try to be empathetic with them. But how could I truly know how they feel? How could I truly know how it feels to not have money to put the bread in the table? How can I truly embody what they need so that they can realize that their ego is a construct of their experience as a human being, and that they are much more than what they think?

Which is the way out of that? How is that culture built?

I truly don’t know, and writing this down is just an exploration into that. Into what comes from those questions as pointers within myself.

And it is that it is not my duty. I’m trying to put on my back all the burden of having to fix something, when there is nothing to be fixed. Probably what needs more space for being fixed is the fact that I generally refer as them as ‘them’, generating into my reality a notion of separation that puts me away from who they are in my own life.

There are certain truths about how the world works right now, and at least those come up right now as the means for exploring paths forward. Each city, each small village has people. Old people, young people. There is an aspect of beauty that each of us enjoy within, and that connects us with joy. And that aspect is creation. I remember my grandmother talking to me about the nicest event that she witnessed as a young woman, and it was the party of the umbrellas. Once a year, people would create their own umbrellas and go out to the street and share them with the others. That brught a deep sense of belonging, of being part of the city, that is lost right now. It bonded old people with young ones. The schools with the community. And perharps that is what is needed. To use technology to create the means for this to happen again. In each community.

What if there was a network of stewards in every part of the world who were in charge of building this kind of events? That is what a carnival is about. An exploration into the joy of being alive. Of belonging. That is what people need, a sense of belonging. All the aspects of belonging that have existed until now have been dissolved, and we have less and less places where to anchor ourselves. We feel isolated. But is that even true? Because of the internet, I can meet people that resonate with the message that I want to bring into the world, and that helps me belong. Do I really feel isolated? I’m not sure. What I would like to have is a group of people with which I could share who I am without caring about what they would think, and I have not built that for myself in the place where I live. I have not reached out. I have not created that network for myself. ‘Build it, and they will come’. What am I waiting to build it?

That’s a good question. I just keep throwing the ball to the future. And how could a network of stewards around the world help me gather the strength that is needed to create a local thing in my village that can help the transition into this new world?

What comes now is a small store downtown, which sole purpose is the pursuit of truth. Of the truth of every one that enters. A small store that is an invitation to explore. How can that be paralleled into what a church has historically been? The church is a place for worshipping, for connecting with the divine. To rest in the divine. It is the place where people go to so that they can be free from the burden of being themselves. Is that really it? Is that a burden? Is that something that weights over their shoulders? I’m not sure. I’m just thinking out loud, and probably what is coming is not too connected to reality. But through this exploration I better understand what is inside me. All the judgements. Since I started writing today I have been judging ‘them’. Those are the ones that need help. They are the ones that are closer to realization because they are the ones that are depressed. And when is the moment on which I realize that I’m not far away from that? I may have all the money that I need, but there is a deep need inside me that has not been met yet, and this is the way on which it is expressed.

Yes. That is the need. The need for expression. For having the means for what I have inside to come out, to be expansive. To reach other people. I realize who I am by interacting with people like you. That is something that comes often. We realize who we are by interacting with others. How does modern society help us connect with each other? How is culture built because of the interaction between each other? Is culture a consequence? Is it something static that is built? I don’t think so. It is the consequence of the interaction. Culture is built every second because of the interaction that each of us has with his own life, and with the others.

How can this be transformed so that the building blocks of society are more solid, and from there the generation function, frequency can create systems that are regenerative and more helpful to bring about the truth of who we are?

I have not even been able to have a nice interaction with my father and I’m throwing all of these words outside. What needs to happen is an internal change. One which is in resonance to what is happening in the world. The analogy of the bridge comes in again. Should I shout from the side of the bridge on which I am, or should I go to the side where they are, realize how they are relating to each other and themselves, and from there start building?

Which aspect of myself wants to build the new way of doing things from a place that is separate of them? What happens if I consciously ‘lower’ my frequency so that I can resonate in ‘their’ frequency and through that be able to realize how to better spread my own message? Is there a fear that my message will be lost if I go in there and resonate with theirs? Which aspect of separation is present when I keep speaking about ‘them’, as if they were something different from what I am?

What is present in these words? What I’m not being able to see? Who is the one that is writing?

There is a deep need for helping. But helping who? Helping how?

Which is the role that I play in this whole maze?

Probably the one that is coming through as I write these words. The one that understand that this whole thing is a maze, and that no one has the answer to what comes. There is an urgency to help. But does the world really need my help? I guess that the question to ask right now is:

Where is that help coming from?

Because when I write ‘them’, I’m speaking from a place of separation. How can I integrate that so that I can speak from a place of ‘us’? What are the aspects of life that are present in all of us?

We were all born as a consequence of a feminine and masculine figure.
We all breathe.
We all have a heart that beats.
We all have good moments, we all have bad moments.

The judgement that arises towards myself right now is that this is too simplistic. It should be more complex. How couldn’t I come up with more aspects of what brings us together?

We are all human.

No matter where we are from, we are all human. And each of us is a manifestation from the divine, which is brought into life as we open up the door for creativity to shine through. To create something that didn’t exist before, and help each other in that process. That is something amazing that happens right now. My wife has been this last two days watching youtube videos of people helping her to knit (?) crochet, and that is open information related to how to create. We all want to help others to create. That is what we came here for. To create. And there is a deep need inside us to express who we are by creating. How can that need be manifested in each human being? What happens when each of us allows himself or herself to just create for the sake of it? I truly don’t know, and that is the magic. Working each day with something new, with a new aspect of yourself, so that everything that you are in that particular moment shines through the creation itself.

The religion of the future is creativity, and the creative act is the means by which we transcend ourselves in service of the divine. That is something that is present most of all in artists, but there needs to be means for that to be apprehended in a collective scale. How would the world look life if each human being allowed himself to be creative? Yes. That is what is present.

But now what also comes it the healing part. All of us has a deep need for healing. What if we organized the world to have a healing year? What if all the resources for the world were put in service of this mission? Can we stop the world and devote all the resources towards the pursuit of this mission? How long does the healing of a human being take? How much time do they need? Of course this is a dream that doesn’t have any grounding with reality, but it is a fun exercise to think about. What if we all held the space for the healing of each of us. Maybe we could take shifts. 10% of the population one month, then the other 10%, and so on, until we are all healed. How would that world look like?

It is nice to dream. I mean, not even that nice. All of this what I’m saying is not grounded at all in reality, because the truth is that most of humanity doesn’t even know that there is something as ‘healing’ available to us.

## I started writing today with the intention of digesting what I have read about Eric and the Phoenix Culture project, and all of the Rebirth and Cultural architecture, and this is what has come up. This is the biggest expression of how all over the place I am at. Sorry about that, it is not easy for me to organize in a proper way what I convey as information. It is just a stream of consciousness, with the intention of processing what is inside me through it.

Should I really try to organize all this? Is it even necessary? Because the deep intention with what I’m writing here is not to give answers… It is to raise more questions. All of this is a pointer towards something that doesn’t exist yet, so in that sense it doesn’t matter if I give organized information or not. The important thing is that I raise questions, that can be used as the vehicle for further exploration. Into what? Into the ways on which to achieve the mission that want to be achieved. Which is that mission? The purest expression of who each of us is.

I move closer towards that mission inside myself when I sit down and write whatever comes up. That is the means that I have discovered right now to explore. But what happens later, I truly don’t know. It is part of what is in the void, waiting to be dug. It is dug? Probably not. It is brought forth. Does it even exist? Are the words that are going to be written in 10 more minutes existing somewhere, or they are just a manifestation that comes forth as they are written? Is there even a way on which to apprehend this? The mind wants to know, but it truly doesn’t even matter. It is part of the mistery, and the more you try to understand it, the more it lacks sense.

So the important part of everything that I read from Eric is not the information itself, it is what the information is pointing towards. It is how it transforms the way on which I relate to reality, by realizing that there is someone in the world that is willing to write about that. That that energy is being moved in a particular way. May it be the answer or not, it doesn’t really matter. The important aspect of it is what it brings. That is the important part of the internet, of us to sharing our creations. It really doesn’t matter if it is true or not, what matters is the consequence that it has in the consciousness of another individual. Because as that consciousness is opened more and more through the creative act, there is a window from which more truth can come forth. And with that, the vortex keeps going. It keeps expanding. That’s why it is so important to foster creativity, because it is what brings up the magic.

As more and more people open up their creative brain, more and more of them is expressed through what they bring forth. That is what comes. More and more of the magic of every individual shining through the fear of stuff not being good.

It doesn’t matter if it is good or bad. It just matters that it is.
