Quite an unusual place for me to be sitting down and writing, inside the car stuck in the middle of other cars, waiting for doing the kind of thing that needs to be done in the car so that it can properly move through the world with all the papers in place. Here the emissions are checked, and they give me a paper that I will be able to show the police if they ever stop me and tell them: ‘Yes, I’m able to go through the world with this car because I did what I had to do’. Being here makes me think about all the systems like this that are in place in the society in which I live right now, on which you have to demonstrate something in order to do another thing. I have to demonstrate that this car is good enough to move through the world, and that enables me to do it. But my inside tells me that everything should be questioned, and the thing with this way of doing is that it can be manipulated. I have known about people that just pay for this paper, and that enables them to skip all this time doing this incredibly time consuming chore. Or they have cars that don’t go through each one of the tests, but they pay the people that are in the back and with that they can do it. It’s crazy how much of this happens nowadays, in every place where there is a human being that makes the decision if something should or shouldn’t be. I wonder which will be the time on which this will end up being different, and I’m sure that it will be when everything is automatized. For example, if I came here and everything was done by a computer, there wouldn’t be anyone that I could pay for giving me the paper that will enable me to pass the test or not. It will all be in a computerized system, which will have the information of the cars that have passed it or not.

Anyway, I don’t even know why I started writing about that. It just feels correct as I’m here wasting all this time to ust be sitting for something that could be done differently. And everything that I see in the world could be done differently, and right now it is very hard for me not to think about ways on which it can be better. And actually yesterday was an important moment related to this, because I did my weekly breathwork session and afterwards I started recording a video to the person that the commander of one of the courses that I’m doing and I was telling him so many ways on which the course could be made better and I was just expressing that it was not good enough and it could be better and after I finished recording the thing I realized that it was another expression of my eternal unwillingness to be comfortable with the tools that are in place. So I was there just asking for something more, but not just complaining but offering a solution to it. And that is a big difference, because I’m in the position of offering solutions right now. I can build alternatives, because I have the knowledge, but what I have to be careful of is to overdeliver, and promise to do something that will take too much of my time (without receiving too much in return). It is very easy for me to offer my services for free, not realizing that I need to take care of myself so that I can pay my bills. My relationship with money has made me extremely unable to value my time enough so that I can charge money for it, so in that moment yesterday when I wrote this thing it was very important for me to afterwards stop and actually delete it. I have been in the course for 1 week and I already want to change it. Is that going to help anyone? For sure it wont. What is important is for me to be able to realize which are the ways on which I would build something new, so that I can have them in mind for me building something that is helpful for the world. Not helping other people build their thing just for the sake of it. That’s not what I need to do. And I offer those things, and my time, and all that because it is an expression of my eternal willingness to be loved. I remember walking down the streets and giving cannabis joints for free to people, just to leave a good impression in them. Just to make them feel good from the fact of receiving something for free. But what is the limit to this? When is the moment on which I realize that I’m doing a bit of harm to me because I’m offering too much? Life is a balance between how much you give and take, and most of my life has been unbalance towards the give side. I’m always willing to give a lot, but not able to be mindful that for the balance to exist I also need to receive a bit.

And that is something that I’m working on, as I make some progress in this journey of becoming more and more of my truth. Part of my truth is related to this aspect, but it is important to understand where it comes from so that I can truly find a balance that is healthy in the long term. Right now I’m doing my breathwork sessions for free, because I’m in the learning part of it, but how will it be when I charge for them? How will my relationship with the therapy and each second that I spend taking care of it evolve?

I feel good with it, anyway. Being there for my people makes me have an extra motivation in my own path, it makes me mindful of my decisions, of the way on which I relate to the addictions and stuff that I was taking in before. It makes me be mindful about my own work, and as I go through the presence process it is important for me to stay true to it. In the book he spoke about alcohol and cannabis being inhibitors of true healing, and I’m exploring what comes to me as I go through this process and stay away from those substances for all the weeks that this lasts. I still haven’t been one week without weed and it seems like a huge mountain to go up. There are moments on which life seems really boring, and it is in those moments when I come up and say: Wow, now I could smoke a joint. But part of the presence process is being there in those moments and realizing where do those thoughts come from, and being a witness of resistance. The resistance that is built by breaking old patterns. The resistance that is built from not doing things that you are used to doing. The resistance that is brought from witnessing what comes up and exploring what it means to change. What it means to be a new being. To evolve. And I’m open to that, but it is fucking hard. Because it seems that no one truly cares. It seems that the world is constantly doing its thing, without even caring about bringing more consciousness. But it is part of the game, and the question that I need to ask at the end is: Who am I doing this for? What is what I want to bring into the world, and how? That is the thing. Because each moment on which I work in myself and avoid drinking alcohol or smoking weed, each moment that I sit down to breathe or meditate, is a moment on which I’m able to be more present for the people that I’m helping right now. And those are the people that I care about. Those are the focal point of all my love and attention. I am the focal point of my work, because eventually I’m doing it for myself and my own evolution, but I truly know that because of that I’m helping them and their own transition into a new way of being. And it feels great. It feels important. And motivating. Yesterday I said no to a beer, because I had deep inside the sense that I was saying no to being more present. And if I’m less present, I’m won’t be able to be there as much as I could be for the people that need me. And I want to be there for them. I want to truly help them become more of who they are, and through each of these actions I’m able to embody more and more of who I want to be through the work that I’m doing with them. That is the magic of what is going on. They, without even know it, are helping me to become more of me by being the ones that motivate me to be more disciplined in the work that I need to do.

My first breathwork mentor that I had brought this book into my life, and she told me that the most important work that needed to be done in order to be able to be the therapist is the internal one. I will become a mirror, and the only way on which I’ll be able to do that is by holding space for the evolution of others. And that is the game. That is what it takes. Emptying myself is the means by which I’m able to be there for others, and I was not aware of that enough until now, until the moment on which I opened myself to be there for others, and be the witness of their own evolution through the way on which I help them become more of themselves. This whole thing is about clarity, it is about becoming more present by lifting the fog, and just by lifting my own fog I will be able to be there for them to lift theirs. That’s how the game is played, and that is not something that is learned in university, or brought in by reading books, or whatever. It is just by being in the field, facing my own demons, that I’m able to bring more and more of what I need to bring into my awareness. That’s what every meditation retreat that I’ve gone to has taught me. To be there for my own demons, facing what is brought up by the silence, by the emptiness. All the biases that are in place, all the ways of interfacing with reality, which are built upon one over the other one and end up being the means by which I relate to myself. It is amazing how each ‘way of being’, each pattern, is just a consequence of what has been in place before, of the circumstances that have been present in my life throughout my whole life, and how they can be dropped of, or better said, integrated, through the understanding that they don’t define who I am in this right moment. I’m more than that, and more than all of the patterns that are in place, and that brings about a very deep sense of peace and freedom. The knowing that there is an exploration that is there to be made in order to make some progress towards a better understanding of myself. A better relationship with myself. A better bringing to reality of my self. A better way of expression of myself.

And when that word, better, comes to life, there is a polarization in place. Does it help in any way to think that it can be better or worse? What is the purpose of that polarity? Does it help? If it came right now it is because there is something to be made from that exploration. There is a piece of information that is in there, waiting to be explained or integrated in some way. Maybe the word is not better, maybe it is just clearer. A clearer understanding of myself, a clearer relationship with myself, a clearer bringing to reality of the self. But each of those things is also a comparison with ‘another way of doing things’, that could be thought of as something that is also good. The one that was in place before was also good -holy shit, I’m comparing a lot and it doesn’t seem to stop-, but this one is better. How can language be built if it is not with comparisons? I don’t even know how to relate to this puzzle right now if it is not comparing, because deep inside me there is a comparison. At least right now. Yes, there is a comparison because there is an aspect of division in place. I feel that division in every part of my being, that separation, and that’s where the comparison arises. Maybe what I’m writing here doesn’t make any sense, but it truly doesn’t matter because I’m not even trying to make sense. The sense will come later, will be expressed as more and more of this whole thing comes out. That is what becoming a mirror is about, bringing more and more of this thing outside of me. As it comes. Without judgements. If I’m comparing, and it is not proper, who is the one that judges it as proper or not? What does it truly matter? It is the expression that is being brought forth right now by myself, and it is perfect like that. It is just what it is. It doesn’t really matter. What only matters is that this is being brought out, it doesn’t matter how weird I can be seen by just exploring my thoughts like this in public. That’s not the game. All this people around me are doing their thing, they are just there, bored, or whatever, and I’m also doing my thing. My thing is absolutely different from theirs, and because of that I could be calling attention, but what does it even matter? Should I stop what I’m doing so that I can fit in a world of normality that doesn’t even make sense?

What comes to mind is one of the most transformative experiences that I’ve had in my life, being in a transformational festival in brazil on which I was in the main stage dancing as if the world was doing to end and then I pushed back and went to the back of the crowd and started thinking to myself: What would happen in society if suddenly a hole was created in the middle of this place and all this people would go in there and disappear? How would society look like if that happened? What would be lost? And that was a transformative moment in my life, because it brought to me the importance of those that are different. Weird. That was the moment on which I truly realized that I’m one of those. I’m one of the weird ones. And it feels fucking good to be one of those. It feels amazing to not be up to the normal things that all the people that are around me right now are doing and be here, in the computer, with the headphones around my ears, in my own world, travelling the depths of my own experience as a human being bringing more and more of it into the surface. Probably most of those that are around me wouldn't even understand what I’m writing about, or what I’m doing, but it truly doesn’t matter. Every aspect of myself that thinks that it matters comes from division, comes from an aspect of caring about what other people think of me. How would the world look like if we truly gave a fuck about what other people think of us?

We build our whole structure of personality around the notion that there is someone that should be pleased. We build ourselves around the belief that there is someone external of us that should be pleased by our actions. And that builds into the structure of personality a way of interfacing with reality that is limiting, that brings about a kind of shrinking of our experience as human beings. It brings about the pain of not being able to express yourself. It limits the joy that comes from just being yourself. From sharing you with you. I only know that I don’t know, and the biggest interpretation of that eternal adage comes from the relationship that you have with yourself. I only know that I don’t know who I am, I just experience myself in every moment on which I’m unleashed into the world. That’s why it is so hard to meet old friends after you have gone through a major period of transformation in your life, because there is such an expectation coming from them related to who you ‘should be’ that is built upon the experience that they’ve had of you in the past. And when that doesn’t come about, there is disappointment, and there is a willingness for them to better understand who you are and to compare the expectation that they have of yourself with the actual experience that they are having of yourself. And that is the puzzle, balancing the absolute unleashing of who you are, the exploration of who you are by your actions right here, right now, with the tough sensations and emotions that come when there is these expectation that is not being met.

It is kind of a primal need for us to be accepted, and going to a tribe where we used to belong and share our ‘new version’ with them and being a witness of the noise that it brings into the interaction may be something different to hold on to. It may be hard to realize that you are no more accepted by that tribe. It may be hard to accept the fact that it is not your tribe anymore, but there may be also inmense value on facing which aspect of yourself is present when there is dissociation within the perception that you have of them not being your tribe and the actual experience of how it felt for them to be your tribe before. What did they make you feel before? Which aspect of yourself was present when you were interacting more heavily with them, and where is this aspect right now? Where did your transformation take place, and how does it fit in the overarching arc of your life?
