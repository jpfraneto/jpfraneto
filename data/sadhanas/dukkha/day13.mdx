Dukkha is the great reset.

People talk about the great reset in the economy, and how things are going to change after the recession that will come in the next years. Yeah, probably there will be something deep going on in that sense, but I think that the biggest reset will be related to how we relate to our own existence as human beings. There needs to be a fundamental change in the way on which we experience life, and that is what Dukkha is about. About going deep into the understanding of how to change. On what to change.

And you will be alone in it.

Yes, we will build a community of supportive people around this process, which will help you as much as we can so that you can make sense of all what will happen, but at the end of the day, you will be alone. No one is going to go through your shit for you, it is the game that you will sign up as you accept to be part of one of this transformational journeys. You will have to go though it alone, and you’ll have to pay with all of what you think you are. You have to be willing to be transformed, because this process will transform you. You will become a different person after this, and that is what the great reset is about. It is not about the economy, or this, or that, it is about the fundamental relationship that we have with ourselves. Everything arises from there.

So yes, there will be a reset. And it will come from each person that will accept to be part of one of this journeys. If one person changes, it impacts every other aspect of their reality, including the people that they relate with, the way they do their job, their health, everything. I’m thinking right now about a friend of my parents that is deep, very deep into the hole of suffering. Every day digging a little bit further down. There doesn’t seem to be an escape for him, but sure there is. When there is that kind of polarity in the way of existing, I’m sure that the other one is present, latent and waiting to be experienced. That is what Carmelo told us about the other day.

He was an old worker man that hitchhiked us one week ago and told us the story from where he was in the streets, drinking all day, absolutely lost and ready to die. He had a moment of opening his eyes with a woman that told her about god, and then he went to a forest, fell down to his knees and asked for help. He saw the feet of god, that is what he interpreted, and from there on everything in his life changed. His whole relationship with life was a transformed just by that interaction. So yes, he is an example of how being at the pit of the suffering can be the means by which a bigger understanding of this whole thing can arise. Ge is a clear example of that, and life brought me to him because that is what I needed to hear. He is the master that I needed to meet. It doesn’t need to be the most enlightened master that knows all the scriptures, there is no point in that. What matters is the way on which they relate to themselves, and their life, and Carmelo was a great example of what I’m talking here. Having a particular experience that changes the fundamental interaction with reality of the person.
And this is what people need right now, this is the great reset. There are higher levels of depression than ever, people are suffering like crazy, they don’t know what to do, they are lost in the materiality of life, and there needs to be an atomic bomb of consciousness that comes so that that can change. So that there can be a reset, and a new beginning. And who is going to be there to guide the path on that new beginning? People like men, people like us, who are going to be the members of Dukkha and who will hold the space for transformation, both in ourselves, mainly in ourselves, but also in each other. We will be a community of people just Doing The Work. Just facing the hard truth of how life plays games to us, and always brings something new.

I have written in previous days that Dukkha is for those who are serious in the path to awakening. But who does that let outside? Could Carmelo get in if he wanted? Probably he would not have felt represented by what was being conveyed with that message, because he could not have conceptualized that the way out of what he was experiencing was this path. Probably he would have been in another spot, in another place, and he would have been rejected by this strong message of ‘you need to be serious in the path of enlightenment to get into this place’. Who is talking when I write that? Am I being tender? Am I opening the doors to those who I want to help? I don’t think so. I think I’m being rough, and too extreme. It is one thing for me to be extreme and relate to life the way I do, in that constant quest of evolving as a human being, but another thing is to build something from there with other people. And I want to build for other people. I want to be there for them. I want to pave the road. And it is very important to acknowledge that the road that I have walked is not for everyone. It is mainly for no one.

Few people would go to the forest, pitch their tent, and take all the LSD that they would find. Few people would be at a Ozora, take all the LSD and go to explore what life brings in the festival. Few people would take 6 grams of mushrooms on their own in the room of their house. Few people would become a Kundalini Yoga instructor to deepen their relationship with the practice. Few people would take a plane to go to the other side of the world to be part of a retreat where they would work with Iboga and a lot of meditation and other techniques. And who knows what else.

I’m not like many people, I’m very special in relation to the intensity that I bring into my path, and it is time to acknowledge that so that I can become a better helper for the people that are going to be part of what I build. I’m creating something here, some days I forget it, but in other moments there is a strong drive that helps me realize what I am doing. It is very important for me to keep that in mind, as much as I can, so that I can truly embody what I’m doing and clarify it. Doing The Work is that, actually doing it, and these last weeks I have been in a blurry place related to that. I have not been completely focused on my writing, and because of that, I have not been in a place of clarity. In a place that gives me the understanding that I know what I’m doing, I know where I am heading to, and I know what this whole thing is about. There is a deep need inside me related to helping people, and showing up to Do The Work, sitting down to write, is the creative expression that I need to bring it all out.

Yesterday I thought that writing tweets was something similar to that, but it isn’t. It is not the same to sit down for 4 hours to just write as part of this Manifesto. The whole thing is different, because I’m relating to different people, I’m not focused on what is happening here, and I’m not bringing from my unconscious the information that will be the one that builds this whole project. It is a whole different game that one, and writing this line I acknowledge it. This was what needed to happen in order for you to realize what you had to do. Get back on track. Get back on track. The world needs you on track. You need you on track. All that suffering because of being lost is just noise, it is just noise that is bringing you down. Help yourself not to be brought down. Just give you that opportunity. It is the same as in meditation. You start the practice by focusing in the breath, and suddenly you realized that you are thinking about the burger that you are going to eat afterwards. It’s ok, it’s part of the game of the mind. Acknowledge that you realized that you were thinking, and go back to the breath. This is the practice, always going back. If you fall out of track and you are suffering from the consequences of not trusting why you are doing the work, or what you are doing, as soon as you realize that, acknowledge it has happened, and go back to do the work. In my case, it is just coming back here and writing whatever comes to mind. Just throwing it out of my mind and into this screen. Because it is not a piece of paper. We are beyond that right now. So yes, acknowledge that it has happened, and just go back. It is the same with everything, holy shit. That is the power of meditation actually. It teaches you not to be hard on yourself when you do something that you are not supposed to do. It teaches you that it is ok, and that every moment is a new opportunity to start again. And that eventually trains your system not to be hard with itself. It trains the conceptualization that you have of ‘you’ to not be hard with itself. And that is freeing. Right now, I feel a sensation of freedom. I spent all this time blaming myself and telling me that I’m not good enough because I am lost and I don’t know what I’m doing. It is part of it. It is part of what comes from this whole thing, it is part of Doing The Work. Acknowledge it, and come back. Without judgements, there is no use on judging, or blaming, or whatever. Just accept what is, what truly is, and go back. You are already out of track, there is nothing that you can do about it more than acknowledging it and going back. Always like that, always that pendulum that will teach you that the long term is way more important than the short term.

And this is where Dukkha will start having its momentum. On doing the work. This project will start with artists, that will trust in it enough to go for it all in. That is what is needed, for them to realize the power that this whole thing has. I have not been focusing enough on artists, and those are the ones that I should be focusing because they are the ones that Do The Work. I’m thinking about Noxx, who I exchanged some tweets with, and who taught me about the importance of just showing up to win this battle with the mind. What if I invite him to be part of the first session of Dukkha, and with his help I co-create this whole thing? So the idea that is being shown right now is that the artist goes through all this process, working 4 hours every day for 21 days, and the consequence of that work is an NFT that is associated with Dukkha. Whatever it may be, and it doesn’t even have to be an artist. Whoever can come and work 4 hours every day for 21 days, and create something. It doesn’t need to be something cool, it doesn’t need to be something out of this world. It just is. It is part of it. We are all artists on the true sense of the word, and the problem with the way that we view it is that we think that the creation of someone that has been in the craft for 40 years is more valuable than the one of someone that has been only 21 days. Yes, it may be more valuable because of his experience, but what if there is a banker that has never done a painting and he comes here and does something amazing that expresses a whole aspect of his being that he didn’t know existed? How does that relate to the quality of his craft? I think that there is a huge value on that. A huge value on the creation of something that doesn’t exist yet, and on participating on something like this. And the thing is that it has to be recorded, and it has to be 4 hours in a row. That is the important part of the game, because it is what will teach you what it is to be consistent, to show up, to Do The Work. Really, is it necessary to be like that strict? I don’t think so. It doesn’t make sense. With this, I’m deleting what I just wrote because it doesn’t make sense. I have been iterating the way I do things, and I have realized that it is better for me to work 2 hours early in the morning and then 2 hours after my breathwork and meditation, and it is perfectly ok like that. It gives me the space for growth. It gives me the space, that is the word. It is about doing the hard work first and then being free of it. That is the game. That is what I’m actually doing right now, having written all this today and being 6:22 in the morning. I woke up very early and it feels fucking amazing, and this is the thing, this is doing the work. It feels so good to do the work, and now I realize how much I had been avoiding it because it is scary. It is scary to show up and not know what you will write about, what will come up. Will it be interesting for others to read? Who knows, it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is that I’m able to show up and Do The Work. That is what I’m preaching about, and that is what I’m going to do. This is the moment on which I understand the relationship of the meditation practice and life itself. It is all about giving me the space to realize. To notice. To be the witness of what is going on. Not judging it, not feeling bad that it has happened. Just acknowledge it, and from there, move on. From there build. From there, show up again, and again, and again. That is the creative process. That is what it brings. Clarity. Consistency. Strength. Power. Beauty. Love. Passion. Energy. Motivation. Selflessness. Rhythm. Presence.

Yes, it is all about presence. It is all about being here, right now, and for that it is very important to acknowledge the work that has been done. Nothing else matters. The rest is just noise. Everything that goes around is just noise, which is cleared when there is the motivation enough to come here, sit down, and start writing whatever comes to mind. It may be noise for the reader, yes, maybe, but for me it is just an expression of who I am. It is what needs to come out, to be vomited, for me to become more of who I am. I don’t need to speak about it loudly. I just need to show up. The Work speaks for itself. No need to use fancy words, no need to use lights and confetti. Nope, just show up and do the work. Just be myself. That is all what is needed. The rest is just noise. Every piece that I create is a miracle. Everything. That is what I need to trust my work. Realize everything that is going on and trust. Just trust. Just trust. Things will end up making sense. Just show up and trust. I have not been able to trust completely yet, I’m scared, but it is enough. Not anymore. I don’t need to be scared anymore. I just need to be. I just need to open myself to what is at the other side of sharing who I am completely and absolutely, without filters, and this is the best way that exists for me to do that. Show up, write down whatever comes to mind, and just let it be. There will be people that feel bored about it, yes, but it really doesn’t matter. What matters is taking it out. What matters is creating something new, something that has not existed before, and build it up from there. What matters is just being myself. Just sharing everything that I will become.

A book is being written, day by day, and it is the book of my life. It is the book of your life. It is the book of who you are. Are you letting that happen? Are you permitting the life force to flow through your whole system? Are you letting it out? There needs to be an expression of who you are in the world, if you don’t have it, it is time for you to build it. Build yourself a system that enables you to create. You need to create. We came here for that. We are a creative force of nature, that’s all we are. Embrace it and start creating.

It doesn’t matter what it is really, what matters is that you sit down with the intention of showing up to Do The Work. Think of it as a ritual. Think of it as something sacred. Think of it as the means by which you connect with what is beyond the understandable. Open up for that connection. It’s nice. It’s quite amazing. People throughout history have talked about it extensively, and that is where you connect to the source. What we historically have conceived as God is a void from which all creativity arises, and as soon as you Do The Work of permitting it flow through your system, you have to start creating. It is just part of the game, it is just what it is. I’m absolutely sure that the future holds for us an explosion into creativity, and what will end up happening is that more and more people will realize the importance of the creative act in the wellbeing of themselves. Connecting to spirit is amazing. We are spirit, and we long for that connection which has been lost, shattered, in the modern world. But that doesn’t need to be like that. It is time to wake up, and waking up is realizing that you came here to create. You are way more than what you think.
