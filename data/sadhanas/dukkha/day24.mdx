So what is the end of shoulds? It is the beginning of “are’s”. It is the embodiment of everything that is. It is the erasing of time. Of memories. Of what could have been. It is the end of suffering, through the end of comparisons. The end of expectations.

Enlightenment is the absolute absence of expectations.

The end of shoulds, is the end of expectations. How would your life look life if there was not an expectation for it to be different present? How would your connection with yourself be transformed if this was the case? It is time to explore that, and what I’m creating is an exploration into that understanding. That is built working with others, doing the work. Each one of us has to do the work, of looking inside, and realizing what is in there. To be the witness of the emotions that you will bring in the other people. How do you want to make them feel. That is the whole game, to feel yourself through what you make other people feel.

Put yourself in the shoes of the consumer of your content, of your creations, by feeling how you feel consuming the one of people that you admire. What does it bring into yourself? How does it resonate with you? What is present in that resonance? Where does it come from? These are all aspects of this exploration, because on the minute that we start creating from the heart, for people that will resonate with what we are creating, consciousness starts to lift off into the comprehension of itself. There is a deep transformation that is created within, as this journey of exploration is built into the fabric of what we can do. And when we create from this place, there is not an expectation for it to be different. Better. There is only the creative act, and what is brought into the individual because of this constant exploration into what already is. This is the journey that I am at, and this is where I’m travelling towards.

Dukkha is all about bringing this into more and more people, using the connection to the self as a means of putting the toe inside the ocean of spirit, so that from there creations can arise. From a place of pure connection with yourself. With your source. A key aspect of this whole thing is to have a creative output, and we are going to work on that throughout the time that we spend together. This cohort is going to be about Doing The Work, and my mission is to bring that about for the people that are going to be part of it. I always call myself as a light that shines towards the people that want to be seen, and this project is the closest that I have gotten towards that.

And breathwork helps me move in that direction, because it gives me a tool to help people go deep within themselves.

The only way in is through, and social media as a spiritual practice is the way on which depression is going to end in the world. We are where we are because of all the comparisons with other people, and the only one with which we have to compare ourselves is with ourselves. How are you doing today? How are you doing compared to yesterday? How does this resonate with the people that you are talking to? What does it bring to their experience? How can you refine your message so that it can speak more directly to who they are? Who do you want to talk to? Who are you? Who do you want to be? This are all questions that require a better understanding of what has happened in life until this point, and in the moment that you open yourself to answer them there is an opening. There is a deepening related to your mission. And the breathwork practice is the means to make this opening clearer. To make it happen. Clarity needs to exist in order for you to realize which is the message that you want to convey to your audience, and I’m here to hold space for that to happen. Dukkha will be a consequence of these first explorations.

It is time to trust myself. It is time to realize that all the work that I have done puts me in a position from which I can help others get to know themselves better. So that they can grow from there. No one says that it will be easy, I just say that it will be. It will happen. And what comes after that is something that cannot be known, because it is by definition the unknown. Nothing can truly be known. I spend so much time building my website to generate trust in what I am, without realizing that I already have it. I already have all this people that know me better than I do, and that trust me better than I do. It is time for me to grow towards that, and to educate people in that journey of self discovery also.

As I open myself to help, I open the window to help myself also. As I deepen the understanding of what social media brings into the world, I deepen my understanding of what I can bring into that world, and how I can help humanity thrive because of that. Isn’t it important that each person has the opportunity to share who she is through the creative act?

The thing is that we all think that we need to ask for permission. That we should be someone before we can commit to do something. That is the most basic lie that society has told us, and it is what has us inside this hole. We all feel like an imposter because there is within us conditioning related to having to achieve something before we can become. And what we have been missing is that we already are what we can become. We are in it. We have always been there. The only thing that we have to do is to unlearn it, so that we can move forward from that understanding into what we can create from that place of knowing. From that connection. Creativity is the future, and those that are able to connect to it from a place of clarity, of truth, are the ones that will be able to thrive. And Dukkha will be a consequence of this.

It is not about building it before all the other things are in place, it is about building it as the other things are being put in its place. Only today I invited 4 people to be part of this journey. Just in one day. How amazing that can be. For me to realize the power that lies within me, that I can just open that door for once and for all. The amount of learning that will come from travelling this journey with the people that I will help is the means by which I will be able to evolve. That is the aspect of myself that was waiting to be unleashed, the one that wants to help other people thrive. The one that wants other people to truly connect with themselves. That is the door that is being opened. And through this writing is how I clarify what is inside of me.

Because I have bought the different domains, I have opened those doors to start creating what I want to create, but that is a top down approach. It doesn’t work like that. I need to let this project emerge from what is possible, and what is possible is only discovered as I travel within the limits of what I have done until now. It is only when I open myself to work with other people that I realize the power that lies in the connection with them. It is only by sharing who I am with them that I discover what I have to offer. It is just by giving and sharing myself that I’m able to receive. All this time waiting to do that, from the consumer mindset, and now is the time to shift that and move towards the creator mindset. The creator of your own reality. The true sadhana. That is the life in a festival, that is the life in a meditation retreat. Caring enough about something to stick with it for 21 days, no matter what it is. It can be anything, but just by sticking with it you will transform yourself.

I have been building transformational journeys inside my head, and through my writing, without realizing that I have to start somewhere. With someone. And the people that I contacted today are the ones that will be there at first. Maybe they won’t accept, it is ok, but there will be others that will. It is just for me to open up the door to receive the applications from people that want to be part of this thing. That is the game. To open it up, and let them come in. Have a voyager each day of the week, and through that, learn how to show up myself. It will be food for my understanding of the world, of myself.

What a great avenue for just being. Sharing everything that I am for other person to better discover who she is, and evolve in that process. Bring that person into the discovery of the power of Sadhana, of doing the work. Of showing up. Of what comes when you are able to show up, and give it everything that you’ve got. Some days it will be easy, some days it will be hard. But you will be there, showing up, day by day, week after week, and the effort will compound. The single most important aspect of success in the modern world is the capacity to show up, to be consistent. I will build a machine for consistency. For agency. For helping people realize that they can care, if they put enough energy into it.

That is the whole game that we are learning how to play here, the one of transforming each individual from a consumer to a creator. It is about consuming with intention, to get the most out of it, and from there, create better. It is about giving the energy to mindfully get into the social media of your choice, and realize everything that is brought to your experience because of that. My mission is to use everything that I have been through to help in that process. To help the other person become more of herself, so that she can share that from the heart. The only way on which you can receive is by giving, and this is the most basic truth that is being highlighted from the world that we live in today.

We have not been able to realize it until now, but for example all those people that give their energy 24/7 to Instagram are literally selling their soul to the devil. They are giving everything that they have to share what they are with the world, and go through a process of understanding who they are because of that.

What if instead of doomscrolling through social media you were able to choose the 8 creators that you care about the most and mindfully go through their content, so that you could truly recognize what is powerful in there for you? Not for your kids, not for your partner. For you. Each of us is an individual human being, and in the understading of this there is the power of becoming free. Of wanting to be different. Of fitting. Yes, of fitting, even with the people that are next to us. More with them what with anyone.

What if instead of asking ‘How are you?’ we came into a conversation talking about what that person created? My take on the state of things right now is that social media is an obscure aspect of real life. People don’t tend to talk about what they saw in there, because there is like this shy-ness related to sharing that. And where does it come from? Because we don’t like to be seen as pure consumers. We don’t want people to know how long we spend wasting our time doom-scrolling. And it is because people don’t realize the power of creativity. They have been denied this, because of the way on which we have been living until now. There is this eternal noise inside our heads that tells us that we cannot share something if it is not good enough. It needs to be better. It always needs to be better. So we cannot do it. But it is time for that to share, so that we can more from this consumer mindset to the creator mindset. It is all about mindset. It is about creating the conditions for people to realize the power that lies behind the creative act. It is not just about sharing you and your creations, it is about opening a window of transformation within yourself.

It is about approaching the creative act with intention, and with a deep willingness to discover what amazing thing will come out from there. Always with a beginners mind, with the approach that a child would take towards the world in the steps of first discovering it. “I only know that I don’t know”, that is the essence of the creative act. Of throwing yourself into the void and realizing that it is a feather bed, that is always looking for you, that it is always waiting for you to deep your toe into it. To be transformed. Every time that you create, you open up the door of transformation. And the question that comes now is: Do you really want to be transformed? Are you open to that?

That is the question that someone needs to ask herself before working with me. Because there will be a transformation. I have opened myself to this transformation deeply, with all the intention that is inside my heart, and it is time for me to share it with the world. This is going to be serious shit. It is going to be the means by which I bring everything that I have become into the world. By shining the light on others. By opening the doors of the power of anonymity also. People are too attached to who they are, because they believe that everything that they could be is determined to the image that they have of themselves. What if they opened up the door for this to be different? Life is becoming more and more virtual, and as this transition continues to get deeper, we are going to be less and less attached to our normal identities. Or at least this window is open, because in the metaverse it doesn’t really matter who you have been, it just matters who you are right now. Which is the value that you are adding to the world, right now? If I create an anon account and share something important that becomes viral, the impact of that sharing will be attached to an identity that is different from the one that I have been attached until now. What is the consequence of that? What is the value of that? Are you able to see it? Are you able to identify yourself in that value? Are you willing to go into that rabbit hole? It is not necessary, but there is amazing potential in what can come from that exploration. You can de-tach who you are (because of your actions) from who you have been (because of your history) and that brings eternal freedom. It is the freedom that I have not been able to enjoy because of the way on which my life has been constructed until now. I am a consequence of everything that has happened before, and a big part of me wants to become free from that. Detached.

It is not about denying it, it is about integrating it deeply enough that it doesn’t determine who I am really. It is about discovering who I truly am, beyond all the images that I have of myself in my own life experience. At least what comes up right now from that exploration. Is a lot of freedom. Freedom to explore. Freedom to become. Without the expectation of what people are expecting me to be, without the expectation of me expecting to be something particular, but just by sharing who I am in each particular moment.

That is the most powerful path that I have found myself to be able to walk, and I’m beginning to move towards that understanding of the power of anonymity. Is it a stepping stone into a future on which every one of us is completely comfortable with his real life identity? Is anonymity the step towards full transparency? Maybe. Maybe as we open ourselves to the world through anonymity, we open up the door for truth to come forth through us. And that will bring about the freedom to just be. Whatever we are in that moment. Whatever we can be. Life is an eternal exploration into what is present in that moment. Not into what has been present, or what will be present, but in what truly is. It consists of a perpetual continuum of presents moments, and that is why time is an illusion from the mind. Because it truly doesn’t exist. The moment that we conceptualize something different from what is happening in this present moment, is the moment on which time start to exist. And that is a consequence of the mind. With space is a bit harder to realize, because it is something more tangible. This whole thing is very, very weird. Life is very, very weird, and as we open ourselves to this understanding we go deeper and deeper into the states of being that are more connected to truth. To the truth of what we are, from the depth of what we have been.

Who we have been is a consequence of who we were in a particular moment.

Does what I’m writing make sense? Does it really matter? I’m not doing it to make sense of anything, I’m just doing it explore the infinite. To explore what is next. To explore what is present right now, and to dive deeper into that exploration, moment after moment. That is the seeking of truth that happens inside me all the time, as I open up to the new understanding of what it means to be alive. Of what it means to be a creative force, that is willing to explore into that by just showing up and writing whatever comes to mind. This is the world that I have built for myself, and it is very nice like this. I really like it. As I come here I realize the power that lies behind these words. Before, I was connected to the internet and a little bit stuck into what to do next. So many options. So many streams of action. But coming here and just writing is the best that I can do to better understand what is going on inside me, because in here there is only one stream of action. There is only one word being written at the time, and that is very, very powerful. It is the same as a painter that grabs the brush, and he has only one option on how to make progress. So he just does it. Without thinking too much about the options, about the shoulds. It shouldn’t be any way different from what it is, because this is the only thing that is truly real. What is going on with the brush, in that exact moment. This word that comes right now, and not any other.

Each word is an exploration into the world, into my world, and it feels like opening the valve for it to happen. For it to be manifested. My mission is to open up that valve for more and more people, so that they can start using social media as a means of discovery of themselves, by truly connecting to the depth of who they are in the process. That is the power of anonymity, of connecting to other people from the heart. Of giving so that you can receive, of maintaining this equilibrium in the universe. That is the power of this whole thing, and realizing that is the strength of all what can be.

The retreat center that I’m going to build will have one computer for each person that will go in there, and it will be a transformational journey because it will enable them to truly connect with their creative source. It won’t only be a connection with their depth through meditation, it will be a connection to their depth through their creative act. That is the power of all of what is bring created through me, and I’m moving more and more towards the understanding of what this whole thing is. Open up that window, and let it shine through. Let is be discovered, by the power of all of what has been until now.

The important thing for people to realize is that the creative act is a consequence of everything that they have been until the particular moment on which they start doing it. It is nothing different from that. So that if they are able to delete the ‘should’, and open up to what is, the connection of their truth with the creative act will be established in a clearer manner. There won’t be a mind in the middle expecting it to be different from what it is, there will be only a being that is expressing itself through the creative act. And that is the power of it. Leaving the mind aside, to open up the world for God to create through you. The more disconnected you are from the mind, from time, the more connected you are to the creative source. The more present you are. This whole thing is an exploration into what comes when there is absolute presence of you in the creative act.

It is what comes when you become dissolved in the creative act. When you become pure presence through it. That is the game that we are learning how to play in Dukkha. That is the main mission of this whole thing. To dissolve what should be, into everything that just is. Just as it is.

--

There is a feeling of something being dissolved in the inside, as I surrender to the insights that are coming through. This whole thing is a manifesto about Doing The Work, about showing up, and the information that is being written is very powerful. It is the way through. The only way in is through, that is what keeps coming, and we won’t find a way out of social media away from it. The only way in is through, and the way on which we embody that is by developing a mindful relationship to it, so that we can truly understand what is the power behind what is being shared there. What does it mean that each of us has an opportunity to build a window for ourselves to the world? What would it mean to you if you were able to transform your relationship with that window towards one of opening? Of willingness to share your truth, in each particular moment on which it is manifested? It doesn’t matter what your truth is, the only thing that matters is that you share it with your heart.

That is something that I find amazing about the world we live in. How many marketing experts share what they know for free into the world? How many doctors share tips into how to be healthy? How many people are truly free? Not too many, and my thesis is that it is because there is a lack of connection between what they are doing right now and what their soul wants to express, because they don’t have an avenue to express themselves. They are just being consumed by the day to day activities, without a creative act that brings life to them, by consuming their life force in a way that creates more. The creative act itself is an act of recycling of energy, of building up more through the act of creation. Life itself is just a creative act. Everything that is happening in front of your eyes is a creative act, it is the means by which the universe manifests itself, so that we can tap into it, and with that, become conscious of our own consciousness. I truly believe that consciousness is the most fundamental aspect of reality, and I truly believe that the way on which we can tap into the depth of that aspect is by the creative act.

Yes, of course we have to do the hard work of overcoming our biases and the limitations that have been brought into our experience because of the conditioning that we have gone through, but once that is done, the window for creativity is more open than ever. Are you going to walk through it to realize the full potential of everything that you are? Are you going to be able to manifest what you are through the creative act?

Are you willing to stare to the depth of you being and love what you will see in there?

Are you willing to forgive yourself for not being something that you should be?

Are you willing to give up the seeking, and to start exploring into the depth of what is, right here, right now?

Are you willing to give up who you have been, in order to discover who you are, by just being?

Are you willing to express yourself fully through the creative act?

Are you willing to show up?

Are you willing to Do The Work?

If those questions light up a spark within you, it is just time to do it. There will be never a better time than now.

Welcome to the end of your world. The beginning of all what is.

Welcome to YOUniverse. (You have always been here).

Thank you for reading. Thank you for being.
