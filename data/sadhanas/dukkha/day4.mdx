    That moment on which you decide to engage in a conversation that you wouldn’t have before, just because there was something that you needed to do. And what comes out of that conversation is pure magic, and it makes you feel alive. How can this serendipity be fostered in the digital age? When there is a decision to be made to be or not to be connected? If I go downtown there is not a conscious decision if I meet a random person or not, it just happens. But on the internet you have to decide to go in there, and be part of the thing at first. And that can be challenging to understand how to deal with. But once you realize that you can create new types of serendipity, stuff starts to happen. Random connections start happening. It is not about the moment on which the connection is made, but the connection itself. If you go into twitter, you’ll never know who you will encounter. It is defined by an algorithm that takes into consideration most of your previous interactions, but there still an aspect of randomness there related to you not knowing what will show up. That is part of the beauty of the whole thing. It also happens in YouTube, in Tik Tok, in any social media actually. You’ll never know what you will encounter when you go into it, and that is where the fun comes from. This aspect of not knowing feels good.

    And now what I’m thinking is: Why is that not knowing safe, exciting, and the not knowing what will happen in the future of our lives not? Which is the difference between both of those not knowings? I wonder and I question that within myself. I guess that there is something in there related to the system not knowing if you are interacting with it or not. Or you thinking that it doesn’t know. Because IRL, you get immediate feedback related to your interaction with a particular situation. The world knows what happens with you, how you reacted to the thing. Here, you don’t really know, it is a mystery, and the fact that mystery is in your control feels safe. It is safe to be a witness to what other people are doing and not having to interact with it in a way that they’ll know what is going on. It is safe to be a witness that is not doing anything for the other people to know that you are witnessing. You can behave in any way, not in how it is expected. There are not many expectations, because: How could they know? How could you know that I actually consumed that piece of content that you shared? You can’t, and I use that in my benefit to actually not do something particular. To stay hidden below my shell and not impacting you in any way. It is present everywhere, as soon as we decide to make stuff public for people to interact with it or not.

    And how can that be used in benefit of creating Dukkha in a way that is actually helpful? Is it necessary for some content to be consumed in a particular way? It is interesting to think about that, because of the consequences that consumption has in the way that the content is structured. For example in twitter, there is a huge movement of people that teach ‘how to be successful in twitter’. What are the steps that you need to do. And in that information there is a lot about being consistent, and a lot of engaging with other, being a cool human being. Isn’t that what we all should strive for? Why do I need the reassurance of one of this cool accounts to tell me how I should do it? What are the steps that need to be taken? Because here is where the clickbait counts more than anywhere else, because the attention is needed for the content to shine. You need to get peoples attention, and the way to do that is to follow a particular set of guidelines. Is it selling yourself? Maybe. But you are selling yourself, learning to play a game, in order to have something cool going on afterwards. Right now I’m creating my content for no one, just for the open space. Wouldn’t it be nice to have more people interacting with it, so that it had a bigger impact? Isn’t that what I should strive for? But really, is that what I need? Is that what Dukkha needs?

I don’t think so, because it is easy to get lost in the quest for that attention. But what comes before attention is trust, and that trust can be built step by step by creating something cool that actually helps people more than something that just appeears on their feed. My content deserves more attention, and what I’m willing to do for that attention is more than just creating some tweets and being consistent with that. But maybe I’m saying this because part of my unconscious wants that attention, I don’t know. But the thing is that you spend all this time learning to play the game, copying ideas and content from other people so that you can phrase it in a way that can be appealing and learning how to produce reactions. And the end of the day, it is all about reactions, and how people interact with your content in a way that produces that reaction from them. That is how we feed ourselves in social media, from those reactions that bring up the emotions that are produced when something cool happens with the content that we have produced. Do I want that reactions? Is that what I’m aiming to? I’m not sure, I don’t think. What makes more sense to me is a different way of interacting with the internet, one on which I add value consistently in a way that is more focused, on which people have to spend more of their time in. When they go into social media, their frame of reference is not related to ‘I want to better understand about life, so I’ll go into twitter to find out how to be a better human being’. Or maybe it is, I don’t really know, but I know that twitter for me is not about growing and growing, it is about having an avenue on which to express my thoughts and engage with cool people. That is what I need to start doing, engaging with cool people from which I can learn. I haven’t done it consistently and it is something that will bring value to my life, because it is good to share and learn from other people. But don’t get crazyon the quest of adding followers, because that is not the means on which people will get to this DAO. It needs to be more focused than that.

    And where does that focus come from? What comes to mind is spaces with like minded individuals. Ancient psyuchoneats that want to deeper ex`pre consciousness. The ones that hang out in rowid, the ones that have had a psychedelic therapy and have a experiential understanding that there is more than what they have experienced, and want to tap into that. The ones that want to create a major shift in their life, and who are willing to create a creative expression that is absolutely unique to theirs. The ones that are able to take a month out of their work, their life, so that they can become more and more of what they truly are. That is the mission of this whole thing, to use all these tools to help people to become more of what they truly are, what they have always been.

    The means for this is acknowledging the origins of the word therapists, that in greek mans something like: ‘That who has the power to hold space for other people to heal themselves0. This whole thing is about healing, but healing from a place of wanting to face the strongest demons, and more through life with the integration of that process of being a witness. Each of us is a witness of the own demons that run through the mind of that person, and in the understanding of that as. A reality there is a freedom that comes. There is a particular aspect of human existence that resonates with this whole thing, and that is your soul. Who you are beyond you. What underlies your whole expression. Your core being. Your true self. Awareness itself. You are awareness, wanting to express itsel through the vessel that JP is. That is the amazing part of thins whole journey, how much of this is connected to the past and to the future. If you are able to recognize the past in your present, you will be heading to the future with a strong udnderstanding of who you are, and that will open the doors of any endeavor that you decide to start because presence is the whighest form of intelligence.  It is huge. It is a miracle.

    It is time to acknowledge the miracle and start living from that acknowledgment. With gratitude, one of the most important aspects of the human experience. Gratitude for all of what has been, for all that is. For the truth of what is. For what comes after the integration of that truth in your self. Of being that truth. This whole experience and every one of them will be an exploration into that truth, and how each of our individual human expressions are the means by which it is expressed in the world. It is a window into the marveling for that. About that. Let yourself be in awe, full of wonder, because each moment that exists is a present. Everything that you are experiencing right now is a present that your former self is giving you, and in each aspect of it there is something that could be thought of as joyful.

    It is easy to forget the particular gift that each of us brings to the world, because it is hard to realize what it is. In the morning I was talking to a colleague and she told me about how scarce it is to have people that are willing to hold space. To just hold space for things to happen. And that’s crazy, because for me it is such a natural thing, that I never stopped for a while to realize how valuable it is. If she hadn’t told me, I would have taken it as a must, as something that is present in the human experience per se, and it would have gone like that. But because she told it to me, I came into the realization that yes, it is something scarce, it is something valuable, and I see myself and what I do differently after that realization. So the invitation that I’m making to you as I bring this story up is for you to realize what is that value in you that you are not being able to see. Open yourself to the world, share yourself, so that the world can reflect you back and tell you what that present that you are bringing is.

If I come and ask you: Who are you? Who is the one that is receiving that question? What is that question bringing up in your system? What are the layers that your mind builds right away to explain rationally who you are? What do those layers tell you about yourself and the way on which you see yourself? All of this is information, it is what will help you to realize that you are not the only one that pushes himself down. You are not the only one that thinks that she is not enough. It happens to all of us, and in the acknowledgement of that there is a collective power that can be unleashed. It is very common in our modern society to spend a long time comparing our experience with the one of others, and what that brings is a difficulty in being truly happy for other person’s success. That is something that happens, and it is something that we need to acknowledge so that we can move on with the integration of what were the means that created this as a consequence. Then we were young we were conditioned to believe that our success is determined by the scale that we hold in a particular range of people. If I have better grades, I’m more capable at X than the person that is next to me. That comparison is horrible, it creates a lot of hard, and it is one of the things that will be evolving throughout the Yeats. It is quite obvious right now that the way out is not being independent and having the best grades in class, but being interdependent and finding solutions with each other. I was never told truly how to work as a team, and it is something that I lack completely. But it doesn’t need to stay there forever, because as soon that it is realized as a consequence of what has happened, I’m able to break free from it as a conditioning. It is very deep in my structure and how I see the world, but the brain is constantly evolving and there can be a time on which this conditioning is not there anymore.

    There is a big sensation of sleepiness, which bringing memories of how nice it is to have the eyes closed and just listen to the music. There are memories running through of many different electronic music parties, dancing at the center of the dance floor always with the eyes closed. Not caring about anything that was going on the outside, just feeling and experiencing what the music was bringing in the inside. Such amazing meoments of exploration into just being. Just taking care of that moment, and fully being the music. SO much learning and value as been derived from al of that experience. It is felt as a massage to the brain, as a breaking free of throughs, or more than breaking free from throughs, it is about breaking free from the necessity of controlling them. Just letting them flow freely through the whole system, and now there is a willingness present of just enjoying it. But that same willingness builds up a separation between the muysc and my Self, because it is always referencing something that will happen in the future. One day I will clean this part of the house. One day I will build up the space for us to grow vegetables. It is always related to the future, and how I will be able to control the future in order ro have a beetter life. Always that life conditioned to what can happen afterwards, not what is happening now. That is part of what is being brought up in this process, and it is brutal to be a true witness of that. To see from the inside of my being the way on which the mind works, always telling stories, always being trapped somewhere in that limbo of the past and future. What should have been, what could be. Always dancing in that limbo, but eventually grasping towards the balance.There is knowledge about where that balance is, about where it has been all the time. It is there, inside, waiting for me to realize it and embrace its location. Closer than close. That is the place where the pond of the mind stops having ripples and it becomes clear, transparent. That is where stuff starts getting interesting, because the knowledge comes from a place of truth. Of true knowing. And there is knowledge that that place is related to balance, to getting into that place of stillness within.

    Have you done some of the work that is needed to dissolve the stuff within you that feels uncomfortable? Or more than feeling uncomfortable, that make you feel identified with those feelings. There are aspects of you that identify with those situations, feelings and sensations unconsciously, and if you don’t do the work of making them part of your conscious processes they will always be there, making you feel identified with them. That is part of the work that you have to do, bringing that into the conscious patterns, shining a light on them, so that you can move towards an integration of all those aspects into yourself. This will free up amazing amounts of energy that are stuck in those patterns, and all that energy will be available to be used in the pursuit of something different. Something creative. All your creativity will be fueled with all this energy that will be freed. You came here to just be. Enjoy that. Enjoy yourself and everything that you are capable of.

    There is a certain judgment present related to not being such deep in a state of flow while writing today. There is a feeling present that is more… Passive. There is not too much coming out, and that is interesting because it is an exploration into what happens when there is permission to just write whatever comes up. To report from there. This ends up being the same as that game of self inquiry dyads, of prompting the other person ‘Tell me who you are’, and just letting that person report what comes up. So this is me reporting whatever comes up in this process of trying to write about what it feels to awaken. I don’t really know how it feels to awaken, it seems like I will be all this lifetime running behind something that runs much faster than me, but I can certainly tell you how it feels to run and run and run and not reach it. It is exhausting, but at the same time fulfilling. There is a deep sense that there is nothing more important to do than this. That there is nothing more important than knowing the truth. How could anything be more important than knowing the truth? There is a deep wondering of how can this not be as true for other people as it is for the one that is writing this words with his 10 fingers. What other endeavor could be more important than knowing the truth? Saving the world from climate change? Helping my local community to strengthen their bonds? Writing a book? I don’t really know, but for me, it certainly feels that there couldn’t be anything more important than this. So that’s why I come back to playing this game, of just reporting what comes, so that there can be a process of emptying inside. There is strong need of becoming empty, of all the words that had to be said but never were said, of all the messages that wanted to be conveyed but never were. Of all the people that wanted to be approached but that feeling of insecurity wouldn’t let it happen. It doesn’t really matter now, or it matters, because it is material for doing the process of integration of what is present here. Of what has always been present, in one way or another. Every story is a summary of all of the others. As above, so below, in everything, everywhere, all the time. Each thing that happens throughout your lifetime is a window of exploration into everything that has ever been, and everything that will ever be. As soon as you start realizing this you will be free, because there won’t be a necessity of being in a place different from where you are, so that you can achieve something ‘more’. Everything is here, right now, today. Everything that you need to be is here, right now, today. Realize that, and be free. This is the time for it. This is the perfect time.

    There is a remembering of the words that were written previously. All the time running on the back of something that runs much much much faster than me. That has way more resources. So what if I stopped running? What if I stopped chasing it? How would the relationship with it evolve because of that ceasing? What a nice exploration that is. Stop running and let it just be. That is the key, to stop running. To realize more and more all those times that there has been someone running, and just make it conscious for it to stop. There is no need for you to be running, there is only a need for you to be. A need that comes from within, so that the deepest layers of who you are can be expressed through each action that your being goes through. Each action, each moment, is a window into eternity. How do you want to be remembered? As eternity itself, and for that, you need to forget who you are. You need to lose yourself into what you are doing, and the way into that is not trying. It is just doing. Every action is an exploration into the power of just doing. Just do. Just explore. There are no direct consequences, each consequence is just an invention of the mind, because all that exists is only a succession of moments that are one window after the other one. It doesn’t really matter. It truly doesn’t really matter. It just is. It will always be. Every moment will always just be, and every thought that the mind can generate about it is just that, a construct that comes from the mind and its preferences. Learn to recognize that, and break free from the identification from them. You are not the thoughts, those are just an interpretation of what is going on. But what is going on is going on, and no interpretation is more than just, an interpretation. Each human being has a different interpretation, and it is impossible for each of us to understand what the interpretation of another person is, because it is fundamentally different. You see life through you own lens. Realize that, and become free from the need for other people to understand how your lens looks like. Become free from understanding how the lens of other people look like. Just enjoy it. Be amazed by it. Be in awe. Each life experience is a window into the understanding of human nature, into the understanding of how each of us is built because of its life experiences. Give yourself the permission to be free. Give yourself the permission to realize that you are not in control of the interpretation that other people have of your actions. They have the freedom to build an image of who you are in their own minds, and this is not something that is at the reach of your control. Be free of wanting to control that. Just be free. Just express yourself as free as you can, and let them have their trip. Let each person have their own trip. And enjoy it from your perspective. Be amazed by what they say to you, and learn to see in each judgment an invitation to a deeper understanding of their own journey.

If they judge you about the food you eat, what does that tell you about the relationship that they have with the food that they eat?

If they judge you about what you say, how secure are they about what they say?

If they judge you about your friends, on top of what are their friendships built?

If they judge you about what you decide not to do, what does that tell you about their capacity to say no?

Each interaction is an opportunity to learn more about the human experience. Enjoy the ride. It is quite a fun one. Each of us has its own stuff buried inside. Realize this and be free of the one that you have. It is not your burden, it is just the reality of how things are right now. Don’t be identified by them. Let them just be. They are. Let things be right as they are.
And this is what will end up happening. What you have been witnessing as you read what I write here. Stuff just wants to come out, in whatever form. There is no need to control the form, there is no need to control what actually comes out. That would be related to a particular judgement of things being in a different way from what they actually are. From me being someone different from who I am, but this is who I am, this is everything that I am, and I’m presenting myself with that here, now. It’s time to embrace it and just let it express itself through this words. There will come a time on which I come back here and read what was written and recognize me through this words, but for now, what I need is only to bring them out. To make space inside. For it to shine through.

I always wonder about artists that have lost themselves in their craft. When Freddie Mercury sings ‘Surrender your ego, be free, be free’. Is he singing from a place of non-duality? Has he realized his true nature and he is speaking from that place? Which is the difference from inhabiting life from that place and from the place on which he sings? Does there need to be a deep exploration into all these means that are used for transcending the ego and the mind when the creative expression has reached a point like that? That is a wondering that runs a lot through my mind, as I move towards finding my own way of expressing my voice, of sharing it with the world.

Right now thoughts come through related to the gap that old people have with technology and their lack of understanding of it, and me talking to my parents the other day, trying to tell them about what I experienced in the retreat that I went in Canada, which’s main objective was to generate conditions of no escape for the ego, so that awareness could realize itself and I could become free. I found myself talking to them about all this concepts, trying to be as clear as I could, but knowing that on their mind everything that I was saying was just noise. There is a big gap there, and as I was helping my mother with her phone now I realize that that gap was also there. Is it that they don’t want to open up to the possibility of knowing? Where does all that come from? Throughs like that come to my mind, because there is a need of wanting to help them, but not really knowing how to do it. Let them have their trip, it is ok if they don’t know how to do it. The frustration is more in me, that I know what is possible, than in then, that they don’t know.

If I talk about being conscious and this whole awakening thing, there is frustration in me when they don’t understand what I’m talking about because I know that there is something that they could be seeing and they are not. There is a bigger aspect of reality that they are missing because the frame of reference from which they are interacting with this whole thing is limited. But it is limited in my view, in the projection that I create inside myself about their experience here. It is not limited in their view, because their view is contained in the reference points from which they explore this thing. So these limitations are just built on my mind, not in theirs, and that creates this frustration, but in myself. I am the one that wants them to experience something more. They are not. So when is the point that I truly realize this and become free of the burden of wanting to show them that there is something more?

The same goes for technology, and this is where this parallel starts to make sense. As I see them interact with it, and not understand, and eventually give up, there is a feeling of frustration in me related to what they are missing out by not facing what happens when you try to figure things out. At the end, all this technology thing is an eternal trial and error, on which you make mistakes and then you learn from there, understanding what you need to do the next time so that you don’t make those mistakes. It goes like this on and on. But in the case of older people who grew without it, when they were young a mistake was much more expensive than now. It was not as easy as now to delete it and start fresh. So there is a much bigger resistance in them to expose themselves to mistakes, because they are conditioned by their experience to suffer more consequences from them than what is true right now. And that is the aspect that is interesting about this parallel that I’m making. On my view of them, they are lacking something, they are not living to their full potential, because they are not giving themselves the space to make those mistakes and learn from them. They are missing out of a huge opportunity of taking more advantage of the tools that they have at hand. But that is only in my mind, in my experience, because I am the one that knows the gap between the usage that they are giving to their energy now. I am the one that knows how much space for growth they have. But they are not. And they don’t care about it. They just enjoy whatever limited thing they are doing, and from there they learn how to make the best out of it. They truly don’t care about where that limit is, because for them that limit is already there, at the boundary of what they do. They don’t want to go further down from that boundary. And it is ok like that. But now I’m able to recognize this, as I see myself trying to bridge that gap for them.

I see that they use X percent of their capabilities, both in their phone and in their existence as human beings, and I want that X to grow because I know that there is a lot of space for growth. But they don’t want. So what does this produce in the interaction of us= From my side, frustration because my expectation of what can be achieved in the interaction of them with the technology or with themselves is not met, and in them also frustration because I’m bot seeing them for who they truly are, I’m seeing them through the image that I think that they can become. I see who they can become if they are able to do what I think is good for them, and I put this image between me and my interaction with them, so there is always a misrepresentation between what I see of them, and what I expect from them. And this brings suffering, so the good thing to do would be to just speak their language, and learn from their perspective of things.

They are a human being as valuable as me, and as soon as I open myself to learn from them as they are now, I set up myself for a growth that is not present right now. AS soon as I become a witness from their interaction with a particular piece of technology, I open myself to the possibility of learning how to become a better builder of systems, because I can create something more accessible thinking on the means that they have at their hand. Not what I expect them to do so that they use the whole potential of the thing (their human condition and their phone) but by who they actually are, and the way that they actually interact with their stuff. This is the magic of meeting people were they are, and not thinking that I’m in a different place than them because I know more about myself or I know better how to use a particularr piece of technology. This is a big bias from the mind, wanting to believe that it is in a different place because of the journey that has been travelled, not having in mind that each journey is unique in its own way, and that each moment, each interaction, is a window into a better understanding of oneself.

What happens if instead of correcting my mother for what she did ‘wrong’ in her interaction with her phone, I sat down a bit longer with that willingness to help her and realized where it is coming from? What could I learn from me in that process?

What if instead of wanting them to evolve spiritually in a particular way, I opened myself up to recieving whoever their are at this stage of evolution and let that speak to me about their true self and how it expresses through that particular person in that particular moment.

Always have in mind that time is a construct of the mind, and the fact that I think that there is a particular ‘evolution’ towards something that is taking place is a construct of the mind, because each of us is already and have always been everything that we will ever be in any particular moment. It is just about taking out the sheet that won’t let it be seen between any mind and the expression of reality that is in fromt of my eyes. Open yourself to the true understanding of what is going on in front of your eyes. And more than the true understanding, the full experiencing of it. There is no understanding to be had, just a full experiencing it, with all the senses, with all the body, with all the being. Just open yourself to receive, and be open to what that is telling you about yourself. Always, every moment, with every person, is a window of exploration Ito yourself, as you are able to recognize who you are in the eyes of the other person, in the story of the other person, in what that person has inside. Open up to the possibility for things to be not as you want them to be. Open up to the possibility of accepting everything just as it is. There is the magic. That is the pathless path. It has always been here, just below your feet, in every moment. Take out the shoes of the understanding and open up the feelings and sensations that come just from putting the feet in the ground and receiving what is already there. Everything that needs to be is already. Open up to the experiencing of that as a manifestation of the infinite love that is ever present inside each corner of reality. Each atom is a manifestation of that love.

I can’t write about what it feels to be awake, I’m not there yet, and maybe I’ll never will. Who knows. I’m forgetting about that constant willingness to be in a particular place, and connecting every day more with what is already here. I can’t write about what it is to be awake, but I can write about how life is when you want it desperately. When you really want to get out of Dukkha, because it hurts. The constant seeking feels like having the head on fire, and the only thing that you want to find is a pond on which to relieve that pain. And you are in the middle of the desert, and it feels that you will never find that pond and your head burns and burns and burns. And you really want to get out of it. You really want to happen. And then someone tells you that the only way in is trhgouh. The only thing that you can do for it to stop is stop wanting it to stop. Give up the wanting. Open up to what is there, and accepting it with every atom of your body. Holy shit, what a cosmic joke that is. And it makes all the sense of the world, and every aspect f existence is telling us about it. The more you walk away from something, the clearer it shows up in your existence so that you can face it with all of what you are. It happened to us with the birth of our young daughter, on which we really didn’t want a C section and we wanted it to go as smoothly as it could. But it ended up being a nightmare and we suffered a lot. That is the biggest expression that I have had in my life related to running away from something just to go closer to it, and right now this whole awakening game is becoming the same. I travel the world looking for the answers on how to get out of the puzzle, and I don’t seem to reach nowhere. There is clarity inside that the way on which progress will be made is just by giving up the quest, letting the seeker become exhausted, but it has a lot of energy. It truly never gives up, it is very very very persistent, and it is fuuuucking exhausting. But it is becoming more and more clear than it feels very good to give up. To stop seeking. Those small glimpses that have been had on which the tension is relieved and the seeking has stopped are windows of opportunity that talk about how things will look like when there is an absolute allowance for them to be just as they are. This doesn’t mean to be passive and not do anything, it is quite the opposite. It is action with intention, but without bonding to the particular consequence of that action. It is action with the freedom that comes from not being attached to what happens afterwards. It is action from a place of love, not from a place of ego. It is action from a place of wanting to express, not from a place of wanting to be seen. It doesn’t matter if someone sees you, what matters is that it is out there. That is the beauty of this thing, and I come back to what was written at the beginning of this day, about modern technologies and platforms being kind of a one way repository of material, on which you set something free out there and people can interact with it without giving you direct feedback on what did they bring into their world. We are creating something like a parallel reality, on which we can throw out all of our unconscious in there and leave all of what we are for the material one. The internet is the place where we become free of everything that we are not, so that we can be everything that we are in the open space of how we interact with the human beings that live in the place where we have decided to live our life.

By allowing yourself to be creative just for the sake of it and share it with the world through the internet, without caring about the consequences of it, you open up to the possibility of freeing yourself from what is inside. Enjoy that. It is amazing. Become free of the consequences of your actions. Just do them because it feels good.
