These days of showing up and looking for people that resonate with the message that is coming through me in Social Media have been of enormous growth and understanding. I always thought about selling as showing a product or service to someone, and just letting that person be informed by what was being shown. Like presenting the offer and letting them decide (with me there, as a witness) if they want it or not.

But it doesn’t work like that anymore. I have sent the website of Dukkha to different people, and the problem with sending it cold like that is that I have to offer a clearer explanation of what it is with the message that is sent. For example, if I send an email to someone, and I add it as a PS, it sounds kind of desperate, and I have to try to explain what is difficult to explain. And I’m also basing my communication with that person as a transactional one, on which I want to sell, and that is not a healthy way to build friendships. I’m being too direct with it, I’m selling myself as a transactional object. And that doesn’t feel good. And it is not even close to working. It is the same as trying too hard to become awake. It just doesn’t work like that, you need to give it space. And for sharing my work it is the same, I have been doing it wrong.

The answer and what is better to do is just be myself and care about the other person, without the underlying motto of selling her something. Just connecting out of curiosity, not because I can win something from the interaction (I mean… Establishing a direct communication with another human being IS valuable, don’t get me wrong here). If that is done in a way that captures the attention of that person, I open the door for her to be a bit more curious about what Ido, and with that, engage in a deeper conversation about what it is about. But that conversation needs to start from the other person, out of curiosity. It is part of what it means to be patient, and to respect my work so that it shows itself in the world. That is the game that I’m learning how to play. Not the one of desperately seeking for attention, but the one of engaging and being social, so that I can grow with a new understanding of what it means to participate in these kind of networks.

What am I here for?

If you develop a strong relationship with your mind, you will become unstoppable. All that creativity is waiting to be unleashed within yourself. I’ll teach you how to meditate, be creative and express your full potential. How to be away from time. How to forget that we are embedded in a cultural understanding of life as if there is an aspect of it called ‘time’. With my help, you will begin to melt time away, and realize that there is an infinite expression of creativity and presence that comes from just being in the moment. Using your breath as the anchor that brings your awareness into the experience of now. Of being here. Of just being. All that time that is spent in the mind, inventing a future that will never be as the one that you have hoped for. The ultimate intelligence is the ability to experience the present moment, of being here, now. That is where all true wisdom and capacity for being creative arises from.

The mind steps in the way, it likes being on stage. It likes having an illusion of control, it feels secure. The reason because it works like that is a lifetime navigating life with those patters of action in place. Doing their work. Helping you survive. But there needs to be a moment when there is a realization that there is nothing to be worried about, there is no harming force that wants to push you back and hold inside you all your creative potential. That force is just within yourself, and you are the one that is in charge of establishing a healthy relationship with that force so that You can be in the drivers seat. When I write the word You, who is the one that reads it? Ask yourself this question over and over, until the truth is set forth. Until there are no doubts about it.

Every doubt comes from the mind. It is the thing that doubts. Awareness is just aware, there is no doubt associated to the fact of just being aware. So ask yourself: Who is the one that doubts?

I will point you towards the non-dual. I will pave the road for you, so that you don’t have to do what I have done to play this game. It is much simpler than that, but I have tried so hard to attain something that I’m on this eternal loop, on this eternal rat race within the confines of my own being. That is because of the trying to be free, when what is needed is only just being free. But truly embodying that being free. Just being. Free is a concept, and being is something that is beyond concepts. It just is. So stop trying anything, just be. Realize who you are by the magic of what you have always been, what has been hiding from your understanding all this time, looking for you as you look for something that is there, waiting for being discovered.

I want to talk about something important now, and it is related to asking permission to Do The Work. There is a decision of going in and doing it, there is an opening for transformation, and it is important to help that process by acknowledging what is going to be done. How would it feel to just open up the space for asking my own body for permission to change it? How would the restructuring of my nervous system work if I opened the window to ask for permission to restructure it?

And when there is no asking for permission, what comes is asking for forgiveness. Please forgive me, amazing body of mine, amazing mind that has come to join me in this lifetime, for all the work that I have done, all this time, without your permission. I have embarked in a deep quest of understanding what this whole thing is about, and that quest has for a long time been from a place of separation, from a place of thinking that there is something to be transcended, something to get rid from. I have been deep into a rabbit hole from which I don’t have the resources to go out, and I have been selfish. I have not acknowledged truly everything that you have done for me to get into this point, and now is the moment on which I realize that, and I tell you ‘I’m sorry’, But I did my best.

The same as a dad that is trying to put the little baby to sleep and looses his patience because of not being able to do it, he is doing his best with the resources he has. I also have done my best, and this is the moment on which I realize it. There is a deep sense of humility that comes from that. From realizing these kinds of things. It has been because of the rush of getting somewhere as soon as possible. I need to become free of suffering now, so that I can truly enjoy life. It doesn’t work like that. It is a process, on which you start realizing things in your life, moments, when the presence of mind is making you behave in a certain way that is not connected to spirit. When I come in a rush and I do my thing so that I can then do the next one, that is not connected with the magic of what is transcendent. It is just connected to the ego, that wants to do all these practices in order to ‘perfect itself’. There is no need for that. The only thing that is needed is to be sincere, and open, and compassionate. And the biggest compassion of all comes with oneself, and because of having written this I can realize that I have not been able to practice that in the confines of my own life experience.

It is never too bad, and probably I will forget this realization in the future, but it has happened. When I start a new session of Doing The Work I will have this in mind. Asking myself permission for a transformation. That is what ritualizing the whole thing is about, longing for that connection with the deepest aspect of myself, by integrating everything that I am into the present moment. I write about being in the present moment, but I know that I’m not truly experiencing life from that point. But I am discovering how to do it.

What I’m here to do is to be a companion in your own journey of self discovery, of realizing the truth of who you are. I’m holding the space for your own transformation, with my words, with my creations. Welcome to the next chapter of your life.

I’m not a guru that has answers, I’m just a curious guy that has an infinite amount of questions. They just won’t stop coming. Thank you for opening the space for me to ask them, for me to connect with your experience through engaging in this conversation.

Jorge Pablo Franetovic Stocker. The name that I have been given in my life is what represents me, it is who I have been calling myself and it is important to integrate everything that it brings into my experience. It is important to integrate everything that you have been until this moment, for there not to be any piece or aspect of separation. It will be felt as a flow of energy that comes as warm sensations, the ones of felling an opening. As if you were melting. As soon as you open yourself to be melted into the realization that you have always been everything that you will always be, there is no need to be running anymore. There is no need for being fixated in time, because what you are doing in that moment is a straight consequence of what you came here to do. It is just like that: magical. There is no separation between you and the consequence of your actions, and with the action itself. Mind melts and you just become what you are creating. Life creates through you, and in the moment you realize this and stop living in the mind, you will be free.

From all the suffering that comes from willing for things to have been different, and from all the suffering that comes from building the expectations of something happening. In the future. That is where the noise start coming up, and it is very important to have in mind these limitations of the mind. This ways of operating that only bring despair and depression, and that are which have us in the state on which we are now, with such high rates of depression worldwide. That is a consequence of living in a moment different from what is truly here, and experiencing life from the point of ‘should’. A depressed person has an existential craving for things to be different from what they are. The only way in is through… What happens if that depressed person goes really, really deep and realizes that there is a fundamental level of existence that will bring peace and happiness? How would that world look like? How would that person look like?

That is what Dukkha is all about. Of realizing the truth of what is here and has always been, so that you can build your life on top of that understanding. Or more than an understanding, on top of that realization. It is something beyond understanding, it is something related to experience. It is time to have the experience, to realize what is possible, and change yourself in the process. Become all of what you can become, and truly enjoy every thing that is present in your life. Stop living from the state of being of separation, for you are not separated from anything. What is staring at you from the eyes of your enemy is awareness itself, the same as you are. Awareness is playing a game of hide and seek through each and every one of us, and it is getting tired of that game. It is starting to build a strong craving for realizing itself. Do you want to be one of the early adopters of this new way of existing as human beings? Are you ready to give up all of what you are to realize everything that you can become when you open the door to just be? Are you willing to give up the control of your life and open to the infinite stream of life? Does this resonate with you? When you answer that question, who is the you that is answering? Is that You? How does it feel to be You?

Are you ready? Of course you are ready, you have always been. You have always been here, you just haven’t realized it yet because of all the games that your mind has been playing to You, thinking that there is something to be controlled, that there is a need of defending yourself, that there is something to be achieved, that there is something that needs to be changed. There is nothing like that, things are just perfect as they are. The biggest cliché of them all, but it is true in the deepest aspect of reality. You are already complete. Everything that you will ever be is already here, and what does not let you experience that is your mind. Wake up and realize that you are something different than your mind. Something that can’t be explained. It can’t be conceptualized. It can’t be witnessed. It can’t be seen.

The stream of words that come directly when there is no mediation, when there is no though, is everything that just is. This is just it. There is no need for it to be different, it is only what it is. I accept it and embrace it and move forward with it. With everything that has been. With everything that will ever be.

The ultimate experience that I have had in my life in terms of what I have gone through in a spiritual sense was after having a deep realization of the importance of the word balance in my life. There was a message that was brought to me related to my own balance, and there was a _knowing_ of where this place of balance was within my own system. I knew that I had been there in some moment of my existence, and I knew that I could go back to it, and there was no rush. And then, as I sat down in the cushion, there was a deep realization that time didn’t even matter. There was a knowing that time was just something that was created by an aspect of myself, but it was not everything that was there. It was not what determined what was happening. It was determined by this balance, by this deep knowing. ‘I have been there’, I told to myself. And that was all what I needed to listen. To feel close, to not feel alone. I had never been alone. It had always been here.

There will be more and more awakened persons, and it will be a process that will be exponential because of the nature of it. The probability that someone awakens to his or her own nature in the presence of someone that has already gone through that process is huge, and this is all what Dukkha is about. Bringing this to the collective level. What comes now is a depiction of the roadmap for the project, as it is imagined:

First, there will be an online stage, on which people from all over the world will come to Do The Work together. The first Transformational Journey will consist of 21 days of mixing Doing The Work with Doing The Rest, with the intention for people to tap deeply into their creative potential. (The sun is rising in a strong mist of very orange colors, saying goodbye to a new moon that has been lighting the whole morning with its brightness. Nature is beautiful). The people that go through this journey will be transformed, and the idea is that they become part of the community because of this. A big aspect of being part of the community is to open up a space in their own town to Do The Work, so that they can spread the word locally. So we start online, we keep doing online TJ so that we can get the full power that is needed to spread the word in the offline world. The process of awakening will happen in a collective scale, and the people that are in charge of taking care of these places (that I have called nodes) in every part of the world are the keepers of wisdom. As the DAO grows, there will be the opportunity for funding these places, that I envision as small huts where people can go in and have an intense experience of transformation, especially with psychedelics. I don’t imagine it is a center where people can gather, that will be online, but it will be a place where one person goes to have a particular intense experience. This enables it to be built in the backyard of the keeper of wisdom, which makes it much more probable to happen. This node is envisioned as a place of exploration, and as a spaceship of the future. We have spent so much energy trying to reach for mars as a species, but the most important journey that we need to undertake is the one within. This node-spaceship will be the means for that, and people from all over the world will be in charge of them. Serving as the gatekeepers. As the commanders.

The next stage will be to work in the metaverse, with the MSquared way of creating stuff for the metaverse, so that people can express their full creative potential in the digital sphere. The goal for each TJ will be for someone to create a dedicated piece of art during the 21 days, that afterwards will be sold as an NFT and will be stored in a particular place in (probably) many metaverses. It can be open, and the fact that it is m2 accounts for it to be movable from one to the next. It doesn’t matter which metaverse it is, it matters that the object is in the wallet. So what will be built is a digital exploration into what a temple for beauty is. Something like the CoSM, the Chapel Of Sacred Mirrors that Alex and Allyson Grey built, but on the digital realm. Just for the cultivation of beauty itself. This thing will not be productive in any sense, it will just be an exploration into what can be. There won’t be a productive aspect _per-se_ of this whole thing, but it will be just an exploration of beauty. Just creating for the sake of it.

In parallel, what is going to be built in different places of the world are bigger retreat centers, on which people will be able to come and go deep into their practice. The first one will be built in Chile, and it will open its doors as a place of deep exploration within, and a strong fostering of the consequences of that exploration that comes from fostering the creative aspect of every one that will be part of one of the retreats.

The mission of Dukkha is to help you go deep within, so that you can connect to the source of creative action in there, and from that transform the way on which you experience reality by being able to express everything of who you are through your own creation. Each and every one of us is an individual human being, each having something particular to add to this world. Dukkha is about opening that window, and letting it open forever so that we can thrive with the magic of what it means to be alive. Human beings are the means by which God creates stuff in this material realm. It is time to start Doing The Work, to realize that and start creating cool stuff.

The meditations are getting deeper and deeper, and there is a sensation present that I’m beginning to realize how it is to just let go of the letting go. It is connected to the full acceptance of what is present. I went away a lot of times, thinking, or witnessing the thoughts, I don’t really know, it is hard to differentiate, but what was present was a sense of acceptance of that process. I was being aware that I had gone, and I was not judging myself in the process. Instead, I kept asking myself: Who is the one that is thinking those thoughts? And that helped a lot during the process. It helped me to realize that there is not ‘right’ way of doing this thing, there is only doing it. It is what my teacher told me a while ago, when we were talking about what a good meditation is. It is one that happens. Every day that you sit in the cushion you some kind of progress in the realization of your own nature, on the understanding of your own mind. Each step is a step that goes towards this understanding in a way that is not predictable, because each time is new. That is why Socrates said ‘I only know that I don’t know’, because the most wise way of approaching life is with the beginners mind, realizing that every moment, every second is a new opportunity to witness what unfolds in front of your experience. It is always a new discovery. For me, for example, as I write these words, it is a new discovery each time that a word is written. I truly don’t know what will come out, and I don’t really care. I just write, and become surprised by what happens.

Today is a big day in that regard, because until now I haven’t been able to polish my work. I had just written everything that came, and left it there, unresolved, unfinished. I have a strong tendency inside me to not finish properly what I started and today is the day on which I acknowledge that and transform it into a new way of doing things. I proposed myself to organize my 4 hours of deep work of today with 3 of them being the vomit of words and 1 of them being the reading and polishing of what was written. Only then I will feel that it is something that I could say is complete. That is what I have been missing to openly share this work with the world. It is very interesting, because I have shared a lot of my work openly, and I don’t really care about it being how it is. I just share it. But in this moment I’m realizing that the biggest aspect of me not trusting it is not about sharing it, is about polishing it. Making it really good. At least consuming it myself. Every time that I have done a podcast, I just publish it, and never listen to it again. Or when I record a video, I just publish it, and never see it. Or when I write a piece of my blog, I often just publish it, without too much reading and polishing. That is because I don’t trust my work enough, I don’t love myself and my creations enough for putting everything of what I am behind it and really be caring about what I do. It is just a vomiting of stuff. And the world sees you as you see yourself. How do I want my work to be appreciated if I don’t even appreciate it enough to read it and polish it? I can’t expect that. And this is the moment on which I realize it. That’s why writing has been so powerful for me, because as I write down whatever comes to mind I end up realizing important things that are going on inside me, important traits of the person that I have been and the person that I want to be. It is just about caring enough to be that person. Caring enough about myself. Trusting enough about what I do. This is a huge thing. I feel a strong sense of peace inside after having realized this.

That’s how the whole thing works. You sit down, you Do The Work, and let it be the means by which you dive deeper into the exploration of yourself. I just ended my meditation, and the last 10 minutes were a nightmare. I really suffered with them, there were a lot of things going on in my being that were uncomfortable, and there was a burning desire to give up and go out of it. But those are the moments that teach you the most, the most important ones, and it is very important to continue being part of them, continue pushing through. Always have in mind: This shall pass too. Everything shall pass. But what you learned by going through it will stay with you forever, there is no way of taking it away. What I just realized related to the care that I put into my work and how it expresses by me not being willing to consume it and polish it, will ever stay there. That is the means by which I evolve in my craft. There is no one that can come and tell me what I’m doing right or wrong. I mean, there can be teachers that give you the particular pointers that will make you not suck at what you do, but at the end of the day you have to go into the trenches and realize by yourself which are your own particular biases, your own particular ways of doing the thing, so that you can become accustomed to them and work your way in through them. The only way in is through. That plays its role in every aspect of life. It is always present.

That’s why I invite you, dear reader, to define in which realm of action you will start Doing The Work. It doesn’t need to be anything particular, just try out something and if it doesn’t work change. It doesn’t matter. Give yourself the opportunity to explore, to make mistakes, to grow. As you go through each iteration you will learn better what works for you and what doesn’t, and that will give you a deeper understanding of yourself. That is the whole game in here: getting to know yourself. And there is no better means to do that than sitting down to be a witness of what is going on in meditation, and then transforming those insights into a creative act. You decide which one it will be, but give yourself the permission to be consistent with it. Stick with it, and put your heart and soul into it. It doesn’t matter how good it is, because what is usually accounted for good is just a consequence of the amount of time that you have accumulated doing that particular thing.

But in this world, there are no good or bad, there is just doing it because time is an invention of the mind. So comparing something as good or bad is also an invention of the mind. The only thing that matters here, is the amount of presence that is transmitted into the object of your creation. The more present you are as you are doing it, the deeper will be the imprint that it will have from all of what you truly are. That is everything that we need here. Don’t care about it being good or bad, we are trying to get rid of those polarities. Transcend the polarity by just Doing The Work. Sit down and just do it.

Open up to a complete transformation of yourself in the process, as you go deeper and deeper into the layers of what takes you out of the trance, or flow on which you will enter. If you are in it and you start thinking about the lunch that you are going to each tomorrow, acknowledge that you are thinking about that, smile deeply about how crazy the mind is, and go back to where you were before. It is just like that, every time acknowledging what is already there (in this case, that you were thinking about your lunch), and moving on with what was happening before. This ends up being a game, not one of chasing after thoughts, but one of just accepting what is there. It is the ongoing process of just being aware of what is there. Letting it be, and focusing on your thing.

Always remember: Give yourself the space for what you would categorize as doing it wrong. ‘I got lost in thought and ended up staring at the blank space’. That’s perfect, as long as you are still doing the thing. Even if you grab your phone and end up answering to an email, it is ok. As soon as you recognize that you are doing that, remember that you were Doing The Work, go back to it, and continue with what you were doing before. This will train your whole system in a way that I don’t completely understand, but I know it works, because I’m going through that same process as I write this book. Each time that I sit down to do it gets more enjoyable, and the burden of not doing it correctly is dissolving itself in the waters of equanimity. In the space of acceptance of everything that is.

I used to blame myself for being eating as I was standing up, for example. Or by feeling anger when I saw my father. Or whatever. My mind is very tricky. But now I realize that all of that blaming was just a consequence of me doing something different from what I should. There was always this ‘shouldding’ present, talking to me on the back of my head, and telling me that I was not good enough. ‘You are not healthy enough because you are eating as you are standing up’. ‘You are a bad person because you feel anger towards your father’, etc. Always that little voice in the background making its noise. But now I know that I’m moving towards a deep understanding that that voice will probably never go away. I’m evolving my relationship with that voice in a way that makes me feel free. Because every time that I realize that I’m caught in those thoughts or feelings, I acknowledge it, and come back to what I was doing before. Or I just go deep into the thoughts or feelings, without caring too much if it is what ‘should’ be or not. It is just what is. And that acceptance is everything. It truly is. I hope that you are able to start experiencing your reality from there, because I also want you to be free. If I’m able to help in any way in that mission, I feel grateful and happy. Thank you for opening me this window.

Holy shit, I feel that it has been a very important session and day. I feel lighter. How do you feel? Who is the one that is feeling how you feel? I invite you to ask yourself that question, over and over, until there is no one asking it. You will begin to ask yourself: ‘Am I crazy that I have all this chattering going on inside myself?’. Congratulations, you are a step ahead into the journey of becoming a more conscious human being. You are beginning to be aware that you are thinking, that you are experiencing life, and that is what you need to do in order to have a better relationship with yourself and the stuff that you do. You will probably begin to ask yourself questions like this often. You will find yourself asking yourself: Who is the one that is inside there? I want to let you know that you are not the only crazy one. At least each person that will read this will start exploring into that inquiry, and we will all become crazy on our own way. It is said that it is no degree of sanity to be used to an insane society.

I guess that the way on which that insane society transforms itself into a sane one is by each of us becoming a little bit crazy, or at least each of us acknowledging the crazy part of ourself that is very deep inside us. The unconscious mind is very wicked, exotic, pathological and yes… Crazy. And as soon as we acknowledge that and start making all what is in there conscious, we will start to know ourselves more and more, and the consequence of that will be a freeing up of space for becoming more of what we truly are. Not the noise that is present inside because of all the experiences that we have gone through in our lifetime. Nope, that is just the noise that won’t let yourself shine through it. By making the unconscious conscious you free up the space for that noise to go away, for the pond to become quieter and quieter, and with that, you open up the space for just being. That is what you came here to do: Just be. Everything that you have ever been, through that body, through those eyes, with that voice. Just be that. Give us the gift of experiencing you as a creative force, as a slope of water that comes from the source from which everything arises. Just give yourself that space, and open up to what will arise. Be amazed by it. You will never know, you can’t know, because it is something that manifests itself as it goes.

Life manifests itself as it goes down the road. You cannot predict what will be born from your creative endeavors in 2 years, because it will be a consequence and a gathering of everything that will happen in these 2 years (and everything that has happened before) filtered by the amount of presence that you are able to bring into that creative act. That is the amazing part, and that is what is filled with wonder about this whole game of being alive. We don’t really know how things are going to look like, and it is fucking amazing that way. Open up for that possibility, of being a witness of your own transformation, and start Doing The Work. The sooner you start, the sooner you will realize how much it will transform you. The only thing that you need is consistency, is showing up, and that is free.

The future is free. Each one of us has the opportunity of being consistent in any particular domain, and that will pay off. That will bring about what you need to experience to grow, to evolve. To be transformed. The sole act of being consistent speaks about an amount of love that is expressed through actions that is very powerful, because you are showing up for something that you don’t know how it will end up. You are trusting, and it is an act of faith. You don’t know what will come out of it, but if you trust, something cool will. That is the game that we are playing. That is the adventure that we are beginning to explore in this day and age, on which the whole world is realizing the importance of doing creative work. In business, more and more creatives are entering new companies because their view of life is what is needed for being a business that is able to evolve fast with the demands of the market. As I have been talking about before, being a creative is surrendering into what can come, without controlling it. It is about being a witness of what shows up, and developing the internal means for being there when that happens.

It is about being a master of transforming reality, as it is. Remember: Always as it is. This involves developing the capacity for being present. For being there, when things are happening, as they are happening. For becoming one with what is happening, so that you can interpret it without your mind, and explore what to do from a place different than the one from which thoughts arise. This is a level of intelligence that is closely related to the one of nature, and it is the higher level of intelligence. Presence is the highest form of intelligence, and it expresses itself through the creation of reality when it is not mediated by the mind. The mind is the servant. The master is presence. That is the killer combination, through which true genius arise. And every one of us has that level of intelligence available, it is not related to being good at math or at language or whatever. As I said before, all of those ‘levels of intelligence’ are a consequence of your life experience. The capacity for being present, the capacity for being aware, is always there, no matter what your life story is. You don’t need to be a monk, or a very special human being, to go into that rabbit hole. Nope. What you need is just the openness to be present to what is, and the compassion with yourself to give you the permission to not do it. To forget. But always remember. Go back to the breath as an anchor into the present moment and remember. You are aware. You are here. You were doing something. Put your whole heart in it. That’s how this game is played. We came here to have fun. We came here to create. We came here to polish every second the understanding of who we are, so that we can have the wisdom to give up everything of what we think we are and just be. Give yourself the permission to just be. You will enjoy it more than anything in your life, because it is the expression of life itself, running through your veins, looking out from your eyes, listening through your ears, touching with your skin, being aware of awareness.

Open up to the possibility of living life at its fullest. This is the most amazing gift that we have been given, and each moment is a new opportunity to learn how to live more present. Or, as I wrote yesterday, to forget how to live in the illusion of time. There is not right or wrong… There just is.
