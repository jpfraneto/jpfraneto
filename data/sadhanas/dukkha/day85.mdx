Witnessing what is happening on the internet makes me feel very nervous, anxious and without clarity of which are the next steps that come. Yesterday was a very important moment because I committed to do something new, something that I haven’t done before, to a new road, but today I come back to these feelings of not being enough. And that’s why recently I read “Discipline is freedom”. Because today I have not been able to be disciplined, and it is very late and just now I came to do my work. This is the moment on which I have been able to sit down and engage in my creative work, which is what I truly need to feel good. It’s something that has ended up building inside myself as a necessity, and today I have not been able to provide space for that necessity to be transformed into something real because I have been all over the place. Doing stuff that feels not important, but that I have to do anyways. So that’s what has happened with me, and this is the moment on which I overcome all that noise and just sit. Just sit with what comes. That’s the thing. That’s what I bring into the world. The capacity for being consistent. The capacity for showing up. That is what is very scarce, and I want to bring more of that. It is very easy for me to forget it, but here I am, bringing more clarity to it so that I can understand what is here. What is it that I will end up building. This is the creative act that I’m going through right now, and it is in this that I’m able to recognize which is the path forward. I’m here, raising my hand, asking for help. For the help that comes from being the one that will carry forward my mission.

I still can’t break free from the idea of participating on the internet anonymously. I see everything that is happening in the web3 community and most of those people are doing their thing without their real identity on the back, and I ask myself: Is it that that is the way on which I should do things also? It has been something that has been running on the back of my mind all this time, and I feel lost. Right now, in this moment, I feel lost. There is no clarity in me at all, I just want to continue walking this path of being free, and I truly don’t know how to deal with this thing. How to manage to act in a way that makes me feel free. What is it that I’m building? What is it that I’m bringing into the world? What is it that I’m in pursuit of? I see the challenge ahead as something difficult, but that is because I over complicate things. Always that tendency that I have inside for over complicating things. I have everything clear in front of me, I’m truly helping people do their thing, I’m truly being in service for 4 people right now that I’m working with and I’m helping a lot, and I’m kind of diverting all my energy into something that ends up being more and more noise. Is it noise, though? I’m not sure about it. I’m just doing my thing, and by walking this path I clarify what I do. It is just so hard for me to see the value of doing the things that I end up doing instead of sitting down to do the work. It is just so hard for me to put the boundaries. I tell myself that I’m disciplined, but am I really disciplined? I don’t have anything else to do that build my business, so am I really being disciplined or am I being lazy? That is the thing. I tell myself that because I wake up at 4:44 am I’m not lazy, that is the story that I tell myself. But is it a true story? Does it account for something? I don’t really know. I just explore what it brings. Because there is this big aspect of myself that tells me the story that I’m lazy because I’m not earning money, and because I spent the morning doing stuff that now I can’t remember because it wasn’t as important as it should have been. What if I did something more important like writing before and then I did the rest of the stuff? Wouldn’t that have been more useful in this journey? I don’t know. I just know that what is in my heart is still there, building something in this new decentralized way, to help people realize their true nature. To help me realize my true nature. I’m tired, you know? I’m tired of this thing. I can’t stand it anymore. There is a noise inside my whole being that tells me that there is something more about this human experience than what I’m dealing with right now, and I feel absolutely trapped in the way that I’m experiencing life now. And it is exhausting. I keep doing the work, I keep showing up for my meditation, for my writing, with the hope that there will be something that will come later as the means for better explaining what is inside me. To myself. I’m here, trying to explain this thing, to myself. And I’m tired of it. My head is absolutely on fire, and there is so many things going on in there that I can’t even understand. There are moments on which I feel very weird movements of energy that make me think that there is something wrong in there, and then I end up just witnessing them because I can’t do anything else. Just trusting in what they bring. Trusting that there is a rewiring taking place, one which will bring a new way of experiencing reality. That’s the problem of having all this intellectual understanding of the process of awakening, because it has inside me all this hope for this ending in one moment in a different way. I don’t know how to deal with all this thing. I’m just trying my best, but I truly don’t know how to deal with it.

I’m telling myself the story of building a place for those that are going through the process of awakening, but I don’t even understand how to deal with it myself. And it ends up being noise, you know? I don’t feel very comfortable dealing with the noise of many people. That is something that I have realized more and more. It is not my thing. My thing is to work 1:1, and have those transformative conversations as I talk to one person. It is hard for me to navigate an environment on which there is more people, one that has more noise. And that’s exactly what I’m trying to build. Is that an intelligent move? It doesn’t feel too right now. And also, I think: Why should I make it faster? It is just that I feel that I have to share everything that I do, and that’s because there is no a particular distinction between my personal life and the way on which I work on the internet. In this moment I feel deeper in the maze than ever before, and it is crazy because you could think that because of being in the day number 85 I should have figured my shit out. Nothing further than the truth. Maybe I’m even more lost than when I started, and it is just something that needs to be acknowledged and loved. I just need to love myself in this moment, and practice that. That is something that came to me yesterday as a message from a friend. She shared with me the recording of a little boy talking about: “What do you practice?” What you practice is what ends up being manifested in your life, so it is a good thing to ask you: What is it that you practice? What is it that I practice? What is it that I have practiced today? Giving love to my little daughter. I slept hugging her, and then I played with her when she woke up. I stayed with her because my wife had one of the most important moments of her life, and I practiced caring about my wife by giving her the space to have all the time that she needed for going there. Instead of coming here and complaining about how lost I feel, what if I practiced embracing the importance of the moments that I spent this morning? Talking to my mother about the Christmas gift that she is going to give my father, talking to the daughter of my brother that is on her first birthday today.

I lost the train of thought because my wife called me and I used that moment to tell her that I was a little bit sad for not having taken enough time to acknowledge the importance of the steps that she has taken. That came up as I was writing, and this is a way on which I’m able to understand the impact that it can have in the world to realize that I can talk openly about what is going on inside me and with that communicate with others. It felt good.

And what is present in me is this tendency and willingness that is inside me of jumping the steps ahead so that I can go as far as I can as soon as I can. For example, I’m just being active in the web3 space and I want to go all in with it, creating a DAO that will transform the world without even knowing where to start. Without having any connection, any knowledge. I’m just trying to navigate the world and I feel lost in it. And I wonder. Should I hold back? Or should I progress? It is not clear for me at all. I’m just trying to understand, and raising my hand so that life can help me by showing me the way. Life, are you there? Can you show me the way? And I’m sure that I have been shown the way, it is just that I’m not able to see it yet. I’m not able to experience what it has brought because I’m too focused on the complexity of what I want to build. But how can I get out of there? There is this narrow line between the genius of creating something completely new that did not exist before and the fact of being completely lost inside it. AAGAHGAHGHGHAGA. It’s the first time in this whole writing that I do that. It’s like yelling to the sky: HELP! I’m here, asking for that help. Waiting for it to come in some way. I don’t know what else to do. Just show up. And I have been showing up. Every day. Today I recorded my meditation live and shared it with the world. What if it was more professional? What if the way on which I shared it was more appealing to the world? But that’s the thing. Who cares about that? Which is the percentage of the world’s population that sits down to meditate for one hour straight? Who are those people? I don’t thing they are enough so that this can have a good impact. I’m shooting arrows that are not going to reach anywhere, and I know that. I’m hiding behind that not knowing of where to make progress to. I’m hiding behind the complexity. What if I started the day with a 8 minute guided meditation? We could start every day like that. Instead of doing the 1 hour crazy meditation, just start with the 8 one. Much better. Much more sanity. And the impact of it can be much, much bigger. I mean, it is just people tuning in with what is going on in that moment and from there exploring the other side.

And yes, I went into twitter and got lost into the rabbit hole of consuming. It is just so interesting what is going on in there. I just can’t help it. So yes, I’m just trying my best here. I’m just exploring where that best is. But today is definitely not the best day. And that can feel kind of disappointing because of the journey that I have walked so far that has me in this moment here, writing this, but it is just what it is, you know. I need to make peace with the fact that the writing of today sucks. I need to make peace with the fact that I’m not in my best day, and accept it as part of what is. And that is one of the challenges of being an independent and entrepreneur, because you don’t have any clue about how your days will look like. And there will be ones that suck. And what do you stick to when that happens? In this case, what is present for me is just being with what is. Accepting what is present in this moment, and doing the work in spite of it. I’m going to write for 50 more minutes, and I know that something will come out from there. I know that there will be an impact in me because of doing this thing. And that is all that matters. That there is something that is transformed. That there is a renovation of the energy. Something is being brought out from my being as I write these words, no matter if they are as bad as they feel. It’s just part of it. It’s resistance doing its thing, the resistance that has all this time being here, so clear, making me feel those sensations of pressure deep in my head. There is a part of me that tells me that I can’t hold it anymore, and there is another part of me that tells me that I can. It’s just part of what is. I’m here to make peace with the fact that I can hold it. By navigating what shows up. By witnessing and allowing it to just be. I’m here to let it be. I’m here to better understand where I am going, so that I can make the progress that I need to make from there. And what is that progress? How does it look like? I don’t have any clue. I don’t seem to have any clear direction about where to move afterwards.

But when is the moment on which I stop and witness what is going on? I’m working with 4 clients. None of them is paying me, but I’m doing something good for them and it is time to acknowledge that. I’m helping people evolve. I’m evolving through that. On Thursday I have a very important meeting with the people with which I will build a community for people that are going through the process of waking up. An online place where they can gather to just have a safe container where they can explore what is going on inside them. I’m going through my breathwork course and I’m getting along with the people that I’m working with. My family is amazing, my wife today had this very important day and my daughter is the coolest person that I have seen. Today I woke up next to her, listening to her breath and enjoying her warmth. She is one miracle of the world being unleashed in front of me. It is time to recognize that, to embrace it, and to acknowledge that there is a lot in my life that I can be grateful for. Actually, everything that is happening in my life is something that I can be grateful for. It is incredible, but there is truly nothing that I could say is going in a way that is different from something positive. And I’m not able to see that. I’m not able to acknowledge and feel true gratitude. I’m not able to express that gratitude with my surroundings, with the people I care. With those that love me. And with those I love. I have been away from my house almost for a month now and I haven’t talked to my grandmother or aunt since then. Those are the people that I should be grateful for the most, and I’m not even able to talk to them and ask how they are going. It is part of the things that I keep saying to myself that I will bring into the world and I don’t. When is the time that I get my shit together and start doing it? That’s the thing. It is never too late. It is just time to start. It has always been time.

I’m witnessing myself deal with this whole maze of web3 without truly realizing which is the power of it, but now I can see it with more clarity. The fact that you don’t have to put in your credit card, or personal information, to log into a website, and you just can click the wallet and be in it, is very, very powerful. There is a lot of friction that is built in the internet because of having to connect with the different systems with the personal information, and everything that that entails, and in this case it is just you doing your thing with the information that your wallet has. The power that is behind that is incredible, and it is just that I have not been able to clarify my position in the ecosystem that I have been running around not being able to build consistently in it. But I will. I know I will. It is time for me to do it. And when I do it, there will be very interesting stuff happening. So how can I do it? What’s in it for me? What is it that I’m going to build? I keep dreaming about this thing in the otherside, where I will build a temple to where people will go and heal. The church is not anymore the place where people go to just pray, but they go there to heal. And to be present in the process of healing of others. That is the thing. If I go to twitter and become lost in what is going on there, I lose the perspective of where I’m walking towards. I forget about it. Because it is fundamental that the perspective of what others are building is not part of what I’m going to build. Of course it is going to be enforced by what I do, but the main part of it is not going to happen there, it is going to happen in another place. And that other place is the one that I have to build for myself, the system that I will use to Do The Work. To show up and do what I have to do. To experience what I have to do with everything that I’ve got. That’s what comes. That is the mission that is in front of me, and it is time for me to acknowledge that mission and embody it fully. It is time for me to become what I have always been, and in that, become free. But boy, it is very hard. I don’t know where to grab myself from. I’m lost in this maze. I’m just exploring everything as it comes and goes and it is very, very hard for me to understand how to navigate this thing. Which is the compass? How do I create with that compass in hand? Where am I going with it? I truly don’t know, and it is part of the explorations to come to see what it will end up looking like. How do I expect the world to understand what I’m doing if I’m not even able to clarify it for myself? How can I truly recognize the power of my ideas if it is not clear at all inside myself? I’m deep into this maze, and there doesn’t seem to be a way out. Where is it? I guess that the first step towards finding that way out is by acknowledging that I’m inside a maze.

I just came back to the bed where I grew up a big part of my life, the one that I used as I came back from school and took a nap. I would love to be able to go back and tell that young guy that there are many things more important in life than partying and playing soccer, which were the two things that took my whole attention back then. It’s crazy how the perspective of time changes, because I really feel that I was much more able to do stuff back then than now. And I mean do the kind of stuff that requires time. Was time slower back then? I don’t know. And when I write this there is a necessity inside me of recognizing the part of me that tells that story, the story of me not being enough right now, and not being able to do too many things. I have been consistently meditating for 1 hour for many, many months. I have consistently been programming for a long time, now writing all this words. I have done a lot of things, and if it is that I’m not able to share it with the people that are next to me, or even with myself, it is because of that lack of clarity in it, but the part of myself that speaks to the universe is sharper than ever. It is just that I haven’t found the way to express that part of myself in the world in a way that makes sense to others, and that is why I feel lost, incapable, or whatever I may be feeling inside. It is just that I still haven’t developed my voice enough, which ends up having me feeling lonely, but it is out there, waiting to be expressed. It is just part of who I am, you know? This is who I am. This is my truth. I have been sharing with the world my truth, with no one listening, but myself. I’m here sharing my truth with myself, exploring how it fells to be myself. Exploring who is the one at the other side. Exploring what it means to just be me. Exploring who is out there. Who is the one that is out there. That’s me, having an experience as a human being, and trying as best as he can to understand how to have this experience in a meaningful way. Where is that meaning coming from? Did I derive meaning from guiding the breathwork session yesterday? Did I feel good with that? I’m not sure. But what I’m sure is that I love humans, I love the capacity that we have for experiencing emotions, and I just love human nature. There may be crazy people that are looking to harm the world, but I truly believe that those people are there because of some big harm that was brought into their life when they were young.

And now the sleepiness comes back, maybe I’m doing everything wrong with my whole body and all these sensations are just of a body that is tired of fighting such a stubborn mind. Maybe it is just that, and I’m running out of the energy that is needed to continue with what it takes to feel good. Maybe I will never be free. But I write that and it is absolutely contradictory with what I have been writing before, about depression, about pain. Do I understand what the pain that people go is about? Can I truly empathize with them? I don’t think so. That’s why the best thing I can do is just learn how to ask good questions so that I can guide them towards a place where they can find answers on they own. I think about all the people that are going through hard episodes of depression right now and it definitely feels overwhelming. And I am committed to finding an answer to that. Maybe it won’t be directly in the sphere of mental health, maybe it is more than that, I have the feeling that that space is not enough. There needs to be an atomic bomb for the ego in place, and that atomic bomb is what I’m trying to build with there journeys that I want to create. With the transformational journeys. For people to get out of the hole. Because I’m at this maze in my own mind, but these people are in an absolutely different place than that one. It is a fundamental difference between being very deep in the quest of truth and being hopeless about all existence. They are kind of absolute opposites, and that’s why I think that there is such a strong relationship between both. That’s where the power of this thing lies. The power of just being who you are, because no matter which part of the extremes you are at, you continue to be a human. You continue to exist. And there is hope. There is always hope.

There may be people that will lose the battle, but that is the thing, at the end, we will win it. I will try my best for that to happen. For people to have a space where they can feel heard. For people to know that there is a place where their voice and problems matter. Maybe that’s what is needed more. More 1:1s. More people talking to each other, and from there, exploring what comes. More people just sharing their truth with one another. To see how it feels. That is the power of the self inquiry dyads, on which you just open the space for the other person to say whatever comes. To just let it out without the filtering of the conditioned mind. There is a lot of wealth and power in that, and it is time to explore it. It is time to bring more of it. People need to talk to each other, 1:1s are needed, and it is time for that.

I’m just ranting nonsense, the writing for today has been a mess. There is no clarity, there is no trust, there is a little bit of fear, with everything that is going inside. It is enough. I’ve been through enough. I don’t know if I will be able to hold it anymore. The be here with you anymore. I feel like I’m giving up, I’m tired of this maze. I don’t know how to deal with it, I don’t know how to enjoy. I don’t know how to feel gratitude. That’s the thing. Am I forcing it? Am I trying to be grateful in some way? Because that’s not how it works. You can’t force those kind of things. You have just to accept them. I have just to accept that gratitude is not part of this moment of my life, and be grateful for that. What is that teaching me? How do the moments of your life end up being everything that you need to evolve? I don’t know. I’m just trying my best here, exploring what is, and coming up with more of what isn’t. I’m just here, waiting, for life to make the next move. I’m just here, exploring, for me to explore the next move. Which is the next move? Just going on with this writing for today. Putting out whatever feels like, so that I can just let the time pass. Having in mind my little daughter, and the wonders that she brings into my life. The beauty that it is to have someone like her, to show me the road, into a more pure way of being. Let’s just know that we are loved, let’s us just know that this weirdness is just part. Of all part of the action. The action that comes from within. From the heart. From knowing that there is a new step ahead, one that will entail wonders, fear, excitement and compassion. Towards myself, and towards all the aspects of me that are not integrated yet. It is a hard day today, and it is time for me to embrace that. I’m not feeling in my best moment, I close my eyes and I’m close to faint. I’m tired and I haven’t gotten anywhere, more than just ranting about something without end. Without beginning, just walking around, allowing the craziness to come forth. Just letting it be, here, together, so that I can embrace whatever comes. It is just part of the magic, feeling lost, without knowing anything else. Life is much more complex than what it seems, but in the simplicity there is the distillation of this complexity. It is much easier than it seems, it is time to let myself embody that. It is all about reaching out to people, and letting them help me become. Who I have always been, more and more, of what will end up. As a consequence of this evolution, as a consequence of showing up. That is the important part, having in mind the long run. It is not a surprise that today sucked, tomorrow, will be another day. One that will surprise me with the wonders, of what it means to be alive. And more than another day, let I just explore what comes. In this afternoon together, with everything that is, and that will ever be. I’m just here, exploring. Navigating. Making mistakes and correcting. That’s the act of creation. The eternal teacher.
