What is going on inside me is getting more and more weird. And I don’t feel like there is a way out of it. I sit down in meditation and go through different phases of the thing. At the beginning, there is a lot of sensations in the third eye area, as if there was something in there that was going to explode. Today after a while there was a new pain though, in the back, on the right of the spine (about 4cm), almost at the middle of the back. I recall when being at the retreat that I had a very intense pain like this one that I immediately connected to all the fighting with my brother when we were young, but this one did not have something like that at all. It was not connected to a particular emotion or history or anything, it just dissolved after a while.

Ah, yes, that is something that came in this session. I realized that most of the samskaras that are being processed inside me right now are in the area of the brain. I wonder if this means anything, but it is happening like that. Yesterday I had a moment of something like a meltdown, like giving up, because I was talking to my wife and she was telling me about all the times on which I have expressed to her a willingness to change who she is. My intention behind that is never changing who she is, I’m absolutely grateful for who she is. My intention is just help her become more of what she actually is. Help her walk the path of becoming less of what she is not. Because there is a deep aspect of myself that feels that a big part of how she expresses herself in life comes from a place that can be healed, and I know that the consequences of that healing are relating to life in a different way. I have faced this friction for a long time, and it is getting to a point that feels the climax. I was listening to her talk to me yesterday and thinking to myself: I haven’t made my point across with her at all. She absolutely doesn’t understand where I’m coming from, and what my intention is. She just feels attacked, she just feels that there is something bad in the way on which I do what I do, and it is frustrating. But at the same time there is a big sense of relief. The same sense of relief that was brought to me this last days on which we went to Argentina with my parents. There were a lot of moments on which I gave up trying to help them to be better.

It feels that finally I’m beginning to embody the fact that what for me is better, that what feels better in my eyes related to what they could do to be in a better position is just that, a consequence of the separation that my mind builds. I try to show them stuff, and the message is lost in translation. Most of my messages are lost in translation, because I’m not able to realize that the help that they need is not the one that I’m offering. And yesterday as I was talking to my wife, giving up in a sense, I felt a deep feeling of peace inside. As if everything was going to be ok, no matter what I did. Every aspect of myself that feels that there is something that needs to be fixed comes from separation, and on the moment on which I realize that and integrate those aspects of myself, I will become free from the burden of having to change them in any way. I don’t want to. I just want to be free. I just want to enjoy life. And I have not been able to do it completely because there is always this noise inside me that tells me that I should show them something of what I know.

But it is enough. It really is enough. And it feels fucking amazing to say that. To give up. Today I stayed in bed until very late, just integrating what was present in myself. This is the moment of my life on which I integrate everything that has happened. This is the moment of my life on which I give myself the space to not force me to be someone specific. It is the moment on which I just give me what I feel that I need. Not to the ones that are around me. To myself. To my little girl. I know that I have given my best to build a family in a way that is resonant to my truth, and I can see myself with the clarity that comes from knowing that. I know it, deep inside, that I have done the best that I’ve could. There are moments on which I don’t know what to do, but right now doesn’t feel like one of those moments. I know what to do. And that is to shut down and keep doing my thing. On my world. On my terms. What happens with the people that are not myself I can’t control, and I write this here, right now, as the means of bringing more of that awareness into myself. I truly don’t have anything to do for them. It is not my job. They have to provide their own healing, I will be here to help if there is something needed, but I need to take care of myself. And forcing stuff all this time has not helped me take care of myself, because it drains all my energy. It produces a lot of friction between me and my environment, and keep going through all that friction is exhausting. It is enough. The only way in is through, and this is the moment on which I realize that through right now means giving up the effort. Giving up all the striving to be someone specific, to become someone specific, to be the example, to embody the truth. Fuck that. I don’t even know who I am, I don’t even know where I’m moving towards, I don’t even know which is the impact that I’ll do in my environment. I only know that I need to act from the heart, and what my heart is telling me right now is that it is enough. Those who want to listen will listen, but definetly my wife right now is not one of them. The message that I’m broadcasting and embodying doesn’t resonate with who she is, and it is very important for me to realize what does that mean in my life, right here, right now.

I don’t feel like this is something that should be stopped (the bonding of my family) because it is important to do it, for ourselves, and for our little girl. I’m learning a lot about myself in the process, and I feel that I’m doing progress. I will not be the one that ends this whole thing, but I’m open if she ever tells me that it has been enough for her. I accept it, because I know what I have done. I have tried my best. Every fucking day. Because it is very, very hard to be the witness of things that could be better, and have the answers to that, at least think that I have them, and stay quiet with them. It is fucking hard to have walked all this road and try to help them walk it also so that they can feel better and not be able to.

But I don’t know what is going inside them. I don’t know what happens inside my father when he drinks that sprite, or that glass of wine. I don’t know the emotional suffering that he is numbing. I don’t know anything, so it is not my duty to be there pushing him with all of what I have. It is not what I have to do. I have to be there, for them.

That is something important that came up yesterday in the car coming back. I realized that most of the conversations that I had with my parents before, most of the interactions, had inside this willingness (from my behalf) that I could get something out of them. Asking questions so that I could better know who I am by knowing more of them. Bringing more and more energy into the interaction so that I could ‘get something out of it’. I always wanted to get something out of it. But yesterday I realized that the whole value of the interaction is the interaction itself, not something that I can get out of it. There is nothing that it can add to my life that is more important than what just being there with them adds. That was something that I’ve been blind to, because of all the deep necessity that I have had of ‘doing progress’. Of moving towards somewhere. It feels like the world desperately needs me to wake up so that I can help it. And that is not the way to go. The way to go is just being myself in the world, that is the value that I add. That is what I bring to it. Nothing more, and nothing less. The words end up being the confetti that is inside the balloon that explodes, but the important part is beyond what could be comprehended with words. I just realized that yesterday, and it was very important. These days in Argentina with my family were very, very important. I’m very grateful for them.

There is a deep sensation of being lost right now. Of now knowing what to bring into the world as the means of expressing everything that I am. And then there is a recognition that these words are just that, they are me bringing into the world all of what I am in this precise moment. What else could I share with you more than this? What could be more valuable than this? That aspect of me that thinks that this is not good enough is the one that makes all the noise inside, that tells me that I won’t make it. That is deep into the maze. The one that is the maze. How to get out of the maze? By acknowledging that I am the maze. That it is an integral part of who I am. And there are a lot of things going on inside me that tell me about the transformation that is happening. How does it feel to just let go of being something different from what I am being right now? How can I just give energy to what is alive, right here, right now? This is what I am, every word that comes here is an expression of it, and this truth and sincerity is the key to bring more of myself into the world. There is an aspect of myself that feels that there is something that has to be changed, evolved, and that is when things start to get weird. That’s when the sensations of being lost come up. The way out of those sensations of being lost is just sitting down and doing my thing. Being consistent with it. And acknowledging that there will be days on which I won’t be able. That is something that repeats a lot. Giving me space for not being consistent enough. I have been most of my life running on the back of something that can come, that can happen, and with this writing I allow myself to just let it go. Let everything go. Let go of the willingness to be noticed. Let go of the need of helping others. Let go of the suffering because things are not in the place where I think they should be. Let go into the present moment, because it is everything that I have, and everything that I will ever have. How does it feel when I’m able to let go? How does it feel to truly embody what comes from there? What is present in that? What is present in me right now?

What is it to experience life at its fullest? Who is present in that experience? Who are the ones that are next to me? Does it even matter? The fact that I spent all these days with my parents and I was able to enjoy that is very important information, which helps me to realize that the only way to live a truly happy life is to accept what is right in front of me. Let go of the willingness to change it. How can I acknowledge that the separation that I perceive with my wife is the same that I perceive with almost all other humans that are alive? It is just that it is so hard for me to navigate that. I feel alone. I feel lost. But I have felt like that all this time. Even in a transformational festival, with all the cool people that can be around me in that moment, I feel alone. There is this deep willingness to be unique, to be isolated from the world, and that is part of who I am. There’s nothing that I can do to change that, the only thing that I can do is witness how it has been expressed throughout my life so that I can better understand this behavior, where I come from, and who I truly am.

I remember in Ozora for example, where I took 3 doses of acid with my friends and then suddenly dropped a fog bomb into the floor and went away from them without even telling them anything. I just went away and went to walk to the festival, to explore what it meant to be tripping balls on my own while walking it. That’s part of what a therapist told me, maybe my internal world is too rich, and that is why I have not engaged too much with the external one. And that willingness to share what my eyes have seen is what builds the separation. My life has been unique, it has been amazing, and there is a big hole inside me when I think that it will be lost for the world. There are a lot of aspects of my life that will never be expressed to anyone, and it is just part of what it is. It is important for me to acknowledge this, and move on with that understanding. That it will be alright. That it is part of what it is. Imagine all the stories that were never told in the history of humanity. Imagine how much heroes and villains went by without them ever telling their stories to their children. It is just part of the game. But awareness has always been there, being the witness of what is going on. That is the game that I’m learning how to play here, with this exploration, with the path to waking up. Embodying the realization, the integration, the understanding, that awareness has always been there. That it is just part of the game. Of the realization of our own nature. And that’s why I come back here and realize why I have been writing this whole book. What is it about? What is it for? Is it for other people to read it afterwards? Nope, that is not the intention. I don’t want to make money out of this book, it is not the intention of it. It is just for helping me better understand where I am at, so that I can make the next move in my life with the roots deep into the soil. So that I can integrate everything that has happened until now in a way of existing that makes sense. The only person that questions if it makes sense or not is myself. Of course it makes sense. It is just what it is. There is nothing different from what could be than what is right now. There is nothing that ‘should’ be. It just is. And those aspects of myself that are building up the walls between me as an experiencer and the experience itself are the evolutionary tools that helped me survive until this moment. But they are not needed anymore. They are part of what will be left behind. They are part of what will die. And it is inevitable. It is just part of what will happen, it is just part of all that is. I’m here, bringing all of what I am into this place, into these words, my truth, my own, particular and unique truth to this place, to this writing, so that I can better connect with what is alive in me right now, in this moment. So that I can embody all the understanding that there is nothing to change. There is no one to change. There is no one to help. There is no one to help. It is just perfect as it is, and in the moment on which I will become free of this, I will be happy. I will be free. I just want to be free. Free from the burden to give back to the world everything that it has given to me. I came to work with my father as a means for expressing gratitude to him because of all what he did in his whole life to get me to where I am at. I just wanted to be grateful. I just wanted to give back. To be gratitude. And because of that I am where I am, running around in circles inside this maze. And the more I accept it, the better I embody how feeling lost feels like.

How will it feel to be comfortable with being lost? How would it feel to embody all this being lost and become free of the wanting to change it? What does it mean to be truly lost? What does it bring into my existence to know that there is something more, truly want to experience it, but not being able? Wanting and wanting and wanting but not being able to? Wanting and wanting and wanting to experience. To be more. To feel what is there when there is nothing there. To see what remains when I’m not there anymore. It is such a big mistery, and I’m always blaming myself for not have it done yet. For not being somewhere. If just the walls could talk, and realize how much I have done to be an active part of the change. But not from the place where most people have done it until now, that is just more noise into the equation. But I wonder, will we all be free? That is what is needed in this community that I’m building. The opportunity for people to ask questions. Will we all wake up? Will we all be free? Will we get to a point of development on which we will all be free? Maybe that is the way forward, just asking questions.

I went to that retreat in Canada to find answers, and came back with more and more questions. That is all what is present, just questions. Just a deep willingness to experience a bit more, to become a bit more of myself, to be a little bit more present. Every day, every second, a little bit closer to absolute present. How does life feel when there is an absolute tendency from my whole being to be present? What is present when there is full presence?

Let discipline be the means by which I embody all of who I am. And that discipline is not built by sharing how I write in youtube, or by shouting to the 4 winds that I meditate how I meditate. Nope. That discipline is built in every interaction that I have in the world, as I remember that Doing The Work is not something that you do only in the cushion. The true Work is to dissolve the cushion into every one of your actions. Embodying what The Work is in all what you do. The ultimate goal of meditation is for life to become a constant meditation, so that every part of who you are can be translated into the act of living itself. So that you can embody each part of your being with the magic of who you have always been. Through the lens of your particular life story. Through the lens of the specific way on which life force is arranged in your system. That is the magic. To express the truth of who you are. Your own truth. That’s what I’m learning to do in this exploration, in this writing, in this game that I’m learning how to play here. It is just a game, at the end of the day, and what I’m doing here is learning how to play it. And that is the funny thing, those words that come back: Learning how to play it. What does that even mean? How can you learn how to play? You just play it. Learning is a consequence of facing what comes when you just do it. Learning is the by-product of showing up. You don’t learn how to code. You just code, and understand better how to do it by making mistakes. You don’t learn how to write, you face the page and realize the way on which your thoughts are expressed in that. You don’t learn how to play. You just play and have as much fun as you can.

You don’t learn how to do stuff. You just do it. That is the new paradigm shift. You don’t learn how to meditate, you just meditate. The fact that you do it correctly or incorrectly is just the mind trying to figure out the shit. But it doesn’t need to be figured out from the mind. It just needs to be experience. Life is an experience to be had. You are awareness having an experience as a human being. That is all what this whole thing is, just awareness having an experience of itself. The universe coming into being, second after second, and each of us being the means by which that exploration takes place. You don’t learn how to live, you just live. It feels a bit confusing, but it is just part of what it is. I am confused af. Everything seems so confusing these days. I went to buy fruits and the pack of bananas was more expensive than ever. It feels like everything is getting weirder and weirder, and I just can come here and do my best by facing this blank page and sharing with it what is inside. Mist, noise, whatever. It is what it is. I embrace it, and love it. I don’t learn how to love it. I just love it. It is part of what is. And it is perfect like that.

The samskaras are being dissolved in the brain, and there is something in there that is being moved. There is an opening that is taking place, as more subtle organs of perception are being activated. There is magic going on, the magic that happens when there is truth flowing through my senses. It is just part of who I am, what I am, in this moment, and I embrace it, love it, and move on with every aspect of it. I am being. I am becoming. I am truth. I am beyond. I am inside. I am outside. I am you. I am the music that comes. I am the vibrations. I am the laughs. I am the tears. I am the noise. I am the clarity. I am the universe. I am the science. I am the rats. I am the snails. I am the trees. I am the leaves of the trees. I am the air. I am what gives life to the trees. I am what is behind what is. I am what is present when everything is not present. I am what is. I am what has always been. I am the doubts. I am the clarity. I am the water. I am the mate. I am the peeing. I am the strength. I am the films. I am the creations. I am the act of creation. I am creativity. I am the stories. I am what is being told. I am the father. I am the mother. I am the child. I am what is. I am what has always been. I am what will ever be. I am more than human. I am beyond thoughts. I am beyond sensations. I am the vibration. I am the void. I am what’s left, when there is nothing in there. I am the mother. I am the information. I am the luck. I am the presence. I am the teacher. I am the student. I am the technique. I am all. I am you. I am.

I just am.

Here.

Now.

I just am.
