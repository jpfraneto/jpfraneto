Which is the most important resource that you have in your life?

The answer for me is time. The manifestation of my life force that is expressed by my interaction with reality, and that ends up being built into that construct that is spoken as time. But as I write that there is a small element of tension present, as if writing it would bring into my experience the anxiety that is built when I’m not ‘using my time properly’. When I’m not doing with it what I should be doing. That’s the thing, that anxiety is always built upon an understanding of something that I should be doing and I’m not. There is that anxiety present, which opens up the possibility for me to doubt myself and my actions because I’m not being as efficient as I could with my time. And that is a particular sickness that is one of the landmarks of this day and age, where there are so many tricks in place for ‘being productive’, for being efficient with time, and when I don’t act upon those principles I feel bad. That happens a lot to me. There is a lot of that anxiety present when I’m not able to do what I had to do in a particular moment.

I remember the last year, when I was building the open source factory and my goal was to build one project every month and work 4 hours every day programming, and those days on which I did not wake up early or those days when I did not achieve those 4 hours I felt horrible. There was like a feeling of deep misery going on through myself, blaming me for not being able to be up to the challenge that I had posed to myself. It was very tough, and right now I’m working on finding that balance, because there is a very thin line between being lazy and not Doing The Work and just giving myself the time to do it in a different way. Just allowing me to build that space for myself. And that is the game that I have been playing here, the one of building the life that I want to live but not becoming too lost in it so that I don’t have any flexibility. Actually, yesterday when I was having this argument with my partner she told me that I was full of rules. And I asked her, can you name me one rule that I have? Something that I haven’t broken in the last months?

Because in her eyes I’m rigid and too extreme if I do always the same thing, and on my eyes if I’m living from the other side I’m being mediocre and lazy. Because of course it is easy to criticize those that are disciplined and that work to find that balance, but that balance for me is built upon being consistent with what you do. It is so easy to fall into the trap of laziness, of being lost in that eternal flexibility of ‘finding balance’. But I can just speak for myself and what comes up as a consequence of that is that I don’t want to define myself by any rules. I want to be the most able to Do The Work, but also be flexible enough so that I can break that commitment when I feel like. But when this is said: Is it resistance? I don’t know, because what I do instead of Doing The Work is also showing up for my family, which is something that brings a lot of emotions into myself and it is still doing emotional work. I don’t know, I’m kind of lost in this game because it is so tricky. It is incredibly hard to push through life without an external figure that is telling you what to do. That’s why it is so easy for people to have a regular job, or to follow the path of going to school then to university and then to a job. You don’t have to expose yourself. You don’t have to think for yourself. And of course if you act like that it ends up being easier. I mean, the type of challenges that arise are completely different, and life ends up being different. I cannot imagine me living that kind of life. The freedom that comes up from being able to manage my own time is something absolutely valuable for me, and here I am, writing this whole book so that I can understand what to bring to life so that I can earn money with this kind of lifestyle.

I look back and in the previous years I haven’t added direct value to anyone that has paid me any money for it. That is crazy. I need to be able to create the means by which people will be benefited directly for what I do, and I know that the exploration towards that comes from the experience of the radio that I’m building. All of this is to better understand which is the project that I will bring into life, and the one that has resonated the most is the radio. And within the radio, I can have the schedule of it so that I can bring to the schedule the programs that I want. I truly want to build something amazing, and here I am trying to do it as good as I can. You can’t imagine how hard it is to have the world open, with each door wide open, and to have all the money that you need for survival. All my basic needs are met, and each time that I ran out of money there is a new deposit in my account with more of it. It is as if life was telling me over and over again that money is not my issue. That I don’t need to take care of it. But it is tough, you know, when all the world revolves around the notion of money. When everything is built so that you can express the value that you bring into the world through the money that you earn. But, you know, eventually this whole thing that I’m talking about is the construct that I have inside me. It is the sum of ideas that I have inside me and that I blame society for bringing in. And because of that, I’m not being responsible for myself. I’m not being sovereign of my own path. I’m blaming the world for my failure. I’m imposing in myself a way of living that is built upon money, and blaming the world for that. I’m mirroring my own problems into the world, not realizing that it is just me the one that can do something about this whole thing. Who cares if I keep crying over and over? No one is going to come and save me. It is my mission to get out of this place of being the victim and start building a new way of bringing value to the world. The money will come afterwards. It is important to think in the long term. Which are going to be the consequences of this way of being? What if I worry more about the value that I bring than from the money that I will get from it? I already told myself that I have all the money that I need, but that is just an excuse for not doing something productive with it. I already spent the last 20k usd just by living, and right now life threw me one more of those into my experience. Am I just going to live through it, waiting for life to magically bring a way of earning money to me, or am I going to be intentional about it and eventually invest it in something that will bring more revenue in the future? It is the important to shift the frame of mind by which I have been acting, so that I can build from there the new way of living that will bring about the life that I want to live. It is important to transform my scarcity mindset into an abundance one, and that shift starts by opening up the door of my own wounds. I keep telling myself that the problem that society has with money is my own problem, and I’m not able to realize that it is my problem.

And maybe bitcoin is the way out. The realization that a new money is possible. I have always been resistant to the way on which things have been happening in the past, and for the first time there is something that is seen and built as a resistance to what was in place before. That is the thing. Before this wave of thought there was a resistance taking place but it lacked the spirit behind it for being powerful enough. Bitcoin has a lot of backers behind, and those backers are the ones that will bring about the information that is needed for us to thrive. What if I bring more and more of this into my life? What if I’m able to build upon it? I’m just working my way through this understanding, but it is something that brings more and more clarity into myself. I have this deep issue with money, so why not devote a big part of my energy for saving it? But then I go back to all this people that speak about the problems that it has, and how more and more people are just scamming others, and yes, what is present now are those women that I listened in the podcast that were speaking about their savings and that they did not have any and they were speaking about the person that is always talking about that in the parties and how that person’s name is always the same as mine. So I felt identified by it, and it is something that always makes noise inside me because I feel that there is a judgement towards myself from society. What if I gave a fuck about these judgements and I just devoted my time to build from the understanding of the underlying problems that this thing fixes?

I have always limited myself because of how the society of the place I live in can point me with the finger and speak about me as the person that is wealthy and rich and living on his own dream because of that. And there is a deep judgement inside me towards myself related to that. I have been living the life of a rich person, without working for anyone in the past years, living from the wealth that was built by those that came before. Doesn’t it make sense? I don’t know, but the sense that it makes for me is that I’m building my whole reality by living outside the mainstream story. I don’t have an impact in the world because I have living away from it all this time, and that is my biggest asset. It is just so hard for me to embody it as a reality. I have been given the biggest gift of them all because I’m just here, in the house that I was given as a gift 5 years ago in on of the most amazing places in my country. It is just too hard to understand. To describe. What life has given me is just too much. And I’m not only talking about material stuff, but also related to the experiences that I have lived. I don’t really care about all this stuff that I have, and that is expressed by the way on which I live. A very simple life. I remember those 2 months that I was walking through the streets of india, and I was not caring at all about the clothes that I was wearing, the food I was eating, etc. I was just being, just exploring the surprises that that amazing country had to give me.

So yes, I love saying that nothing of this wealth defines me, but then I come back and realize that it defines everything that I am really. On an unconscious level, I have been living this life that I have been living because of it. I have been able to give my small daughter the attention that I have given her because of having lived in this place, with the amount of time that I have available, and it is time for me to express gratitude for that. Life deserves it. And what comes at the other side? Which is the expression of life that wants to come forth as the means by which I embody this gratitude into what I do every day? That is the exploration that is taking place as I write this words. As I act every day, moving towards where I’m moving. There is no pure clarity about it, but I know that I’m moving towards something that is the embodiment of all of what I have been. That’s the radio, bitcoin, blockchain, music, breathwork, psychedelics, etc. Depression. I’m desperately trying to fit the whole array of pieces together, so that I can build something that has sense with all those pieces inside. I’m not sure what it will be, I’m not clear where does all of this ends, but I’m just going to keep the exploration. Just showing up to Do The Work. That’s the thing, just Do The Work. Just come up with what comes. I’m so focused on this thing that I need to do something creative, something focused, that I forget the big picture. And which is the big picture in this case? Where am I walking towards? To a deeper embodiment of my truth. And what is that truth? How is it expressed? By what I give my energy to. By what I decide to do. By what I care about. It is just a matter of realizing that the strength comes from the place on which I have been all this time. I have done everything that I have done because I wanted to unconsciously move towards a place where I am at now.

I love psychedelics, and what they mean in our experience as a human being, and because of that I ended up building my meditation practice, so that I could live in a psychedelic state my whole existence. I want to be psychedelic. I am. I just haven’t realized it yet. How does a psychedelic book look like? I’m pretty sure it can be like this. Like me, every day, exploring what comes from there. Like me being the witness of everything that I can become when I sit down and Do The Work. That’s this book about. It is a deep and clear reminder of the importance of sitting down and Doing The Work. In the future I will come and read it, one day after the other one, for 88 days, and during those days I will be building whatever it is what I’m going to build. Life can’t stop, life won’t stop, and it is time for me to erase every kind of tension from my experience of it. And the only way on which I will be able to do that is by being sovereign of my own crystallized life force, which is money. The only way on which I will be able to bring about all the strength that I have inside is by perfecting my relationship with money, and that will happen when I’m able to define truly which that relationship is. It is not something that I need to make deaf ears, or shut my sight towards. It is something that I need to face with everything that I have, with everything that I am, so that I can understand more and more what this whole game is. And the fact that my father worked 30 years in banks is a huge element of this whole puzzle. There is an immense amount of information in there related to what is the role that money plays in society. Banks are the places of society that move money around, and I need to extract as much information from him as I can so that I can better understand what is the role that they play in society. Ask him questions. I always tell myself that I’m good at asking questions. Which are going to be the questions that I ask? Who is it going to be the ones that will be listening as I ask them? I need to walk that path, and get myself into the community so that I can start adding value to it. It is only through that that I will be able to learn more and more about this whole game. The game of life. The game of money. Money is the biggest driver of our civilization nowadays. How am I going to decide to play that game? It is time for me to be intentional about it, and this new kind of money, this new way of being of money, seems like a good answer to it.

Since a long time ago, I can’t even remember when, I have had this feeling that I have been lied to my whole life. It seems that all the systems that are in place have been put there to fit a particular narrative, a particular way of experiencing life, of dealing with it, that has at its focus something different from what I want to bring to it. The problem is that I have been so identified with this separation that I have not been able to fit in the way of doing things that is present right now so that I can build a new solution from the inside. I was doing this masters in innovation in the most prestigious university in my country and I decided to drop off because it didn’t fit my needs. I did not feel comfortable with what was happening there. And now I’m here, trying to decide what I’m going to put my energy in, and it is fucking hard. There is always this burning sensation inside me of wanting to get the most out of what I’m doing, so that I can use my time wisely. But it is better to start and fail than to never start, and that is the thing that I’m doing here, exploring what comes from the identification with that starting point. I know that I want to build something, it is just that I don’t know what yet. I don’t know what is it that I’m going to put my energy in. I’m remembering now the founder of a company that was telling the story of what they started doing, and it is something radically different from what they are doing right now. Is it that I’m just wasting my time waiting to start? Should I just do it and bring it on? And if I had to start a company tomorrow, what would that company do? Which would be the motivation for it?

What comes to mind is the relationship that I have seen between the healing work and bitcoin. It has shown up to me more than once in the work that I have done with the breath. When I have gone deep in there, I have realized that it is something very important that can happen in there. What if people can come and share a big writing with everything that they are going through, and the system transforms that writing into the recommendation of who they can work with? What if I’m able to bring in healers from all kinds of things so that they can hop into a zoom conversation with these people? What if all this worked with a membership that people had to go through? You can do group of personal stuff, who knows. It is part of the options that can be offered. But the thing is to have these options, and let people decide which is the one that is going to be the most useful for them. Or let the algo decide, really, because people don’t even know what to ask for. They just have a budget, and a thing that they want to work on. Everyone wants to be better nowadays, and the mental health thing is in the floor. Everyone is depressed, and it is time to work on that. And the good thing about the healing arts is that a big part of them can be done through zoom, with people everywhere in the world. Connecting to one another. That is something very valuable, that I have to use as information to build what I will build. All this money that I have been given is just the seed that I will use to plant and to start creating what this will be in the future. And another option that comes to mind right now is the app for prompting ‘tell me who you are’ with people from all over the world. That is another thing that has come up very strongly lately, and here I am, trying to understand more and more what is it that I have to build. Because I also think about building something normal in my town, so that I can have that important connection with the people that are there. Just the music store, where people can come in and get the finest audio equipments that exist. That is also something that fills my heart with joy, and I can start doing that right now because I have this office as the place where I can explore that avenue. I can start creating in here a music store, in the memory of my grandfather, and the music store can be the IRL thing and the radio station can be the internet thing. Why complexify everything? I think of myself as the savior of humanity and I want to build the thing that will fix all of our problems, but what happens if I give up that motto and I just focus on living a good life here, where I live? Isn’t it that the impact needs to be done locally so that it can bring into myself that humanity that is so important? The amount of wealth that is brought into me because of the interaction with other humans is just too important for me to give up, and it is time for me to acknowledge that and transform it into a reality. What if I allow myself to just be the witness of the process that comes from having a store in the city? In memory of my good friend Leo, building the coolest store in town. I don’t need to have the most complex thing of them all, I just need to have something that works. That is all that matters. I’m here designing the life of my dreams, not knowing which is the next step forward. So many options, so many avenues, and it seems like this is another expression of Dukkha. The not knowing how to progress, the not knowing of which is the path ahead. The trying to fit everything in, and the complexity that is built upon that. I just need to bring more simplicity into the equation, so that I can truly become more and more of the value that I can bring into the world. What better way of being a proponent of bitcoin than having a store that accepts it as a means for payment? How would that look like? I have always dreamt of that store. How would life look like if I transformed it into a reality?

The number of options is just incredible, and it is so hard to decide which is the way forward. Will this sensation of it not being enough disappear some day? Will I be free of this? I don’t truly know. But what helps as a means for better developing these ideas inside me is to witness what comes to me when I do one of them. For example, right now I am already working on the breathwork sessions. They are already happening. I am already a facilitator, and that is bringing new energy into myself. I’m exploring what comes from there. And with it, I’m learning more about myself. It’s crazy, because as always, I’m doing it and I am already thinking what I will do next. And I have always told myself that I can do anything I want, it is just a matter of committing to it. Why do I have to commit to everything that comes in front of me? Isn’t it that by wanting to commit to everything I end up committing to anything? Isn’t that how it works? Isn’t that the message that life is giving me? You can spend your whole life building these complex systems that will change the world, but which is the prize that you will pay? What if you just decided to bring your whole focus into one thing and started building from there? And the interesting part about that is that I am already doing it. I’m already in this path of becoming a better and better breathwork facilitator, so why not push it with everything I’ve got? Isn’t that a more intelligent approach, instead of trying to make everything more and more complex? What if I gave up the complexity that I have been building inside my experience as a human being since my early childhood as the means of differentiating from my ‘too-basic-to-be-true’ parents and I just opened up to the simplicity that comes at the other side? Why do I want all this complexity? Which is the purpose that it serves? I don’t really know. I could be doing everything, but in that sense, am I not doing anything? What if I focused all my energy, all my life force, into truly helping those that are around me, those that I can reach, and from there I can expand outwards? Isn’t it that by connecting with others I grow? I go into Twitter so that I can connect with the whole world, but I end up having an impact that is diluted and no one listens. Or not? How true is that? In one hour I will have a meeting with a person that I met through there, and the fact is that the more you put in the more you get out. What if I decided to put even more in? What would come at the other side?

I went to that retreat in Canada to find answers, and I ended up with more questions.

I’m writing this whole book to find answers, and I’m ending up with more questions.

Which is the means by starting to answer those questions? Exposing myself to the world, and witnessing what comes from there. That is the game that I will start playing. That is the commitment that I have to make with myself. Consistency pays off, and the intention to build a better world will manifest through anything that I decide to do, no matter what it is. It is time to focus, and all this writing is the magnifying glass for that.
