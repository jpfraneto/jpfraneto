There were doubts present inside me yesterday, related to the whole meditation process, to the breathwork, to the writing, basically with everything. I was feeling the anxiety that is brought up when there is not a roadmap to follow, when there is no one telling you if what you are doing is correct or not. But what does ‘correct’ even mean? That’s why it has been important for me to develop the capacity and consistency to just show up, and trust that eventually it will all make sense. That’s the way I exist, you know. I don’t meditate following the books, I just sit down and am. With whatever is present. I don’t write as if there was a particular guideline for me to do it in a proper way. I just sit down, and write. Whatever comes up. I let it be. Without judgements, without preconceptions, only with what is present. I just breathe. And let it be.

And it has been showing me something the last days. Because there is an aspect of myself that tells me that I should be following a particular lineage, or listening to a particular teacher, or moving towards a particular direction so that I can connect with something that can serve as an anchor in the path. And I’m not doing it. I keep gathering resources from every place, but at the end, just trusting on my own instinct. On what I have inside. And it has been perfect like that. I mean, it may not be perfect because there is this pressure in my head that signals an alarm that there is something that may be wrong about what I’m doing, but overall, I deeply feel that I’m walking towards the right direction. And that right direction is the one of my soul. The one of listening to what is within, and moving towards where that compass is pointing me to. I’m trusting the process, with everything I’ve got, and for that, you’ve got to have a process, you know?

I have been developing this process all this time. The one of showing up, consistently and regularly, to allow the change to happen from within. And that change has been hard to deal with, there are moments on which I feel lost, I feel lazy, I feel that I’m not giving my best, but there is also a willingness to hear to what my system is telling me, and just be with it as clearly as I can. It is just the exploration on which I’m in, and life is doing its thing on the background. I’ve gotten people reach out for the breathwork sessions and the voice is going to start to spread, my writing here has a lot of valuable insights that I will revisit afterwards and will feel like magical. I’m just going through it, navigating the resistance, and being with what it brings into myself. The whole Doing The Work thing is just a means for building something that will have you in the future looking back and realizing how far you’ve gone. But it is hard to realize it as you do it, at least for me it has been hard, because the results of it are not clear. I come here with the intention to open myself, to be transformed, and that transformation is not directly clear.

At least that is the story that I’m telling myself. Because I can tell another story. Yesterday I was walking with my daughter on the chest, listening to an amazing podcast about NFT’s and my mind was building up all these stories about how what I’m doing can be transformed into a reality that can transform the world as I know it. Because I have Done The Work, there are unconscious aspects of my being that are working when I’m not writing, and those are the ones that eventually end up building the ideas that will come up as the stuff that is going to transform my relationship with reality in the future. The Real Work starts when you stop Doing The Work, and you go out to the world with awe, with curiosity, with wonder. It is what happens when you allow life to do its thing, when you give up the control, when you just trust in whatever the consequences of Doing The Work will be.

And it is invisible. But in this era of the internet, those network effects are stronger than ever. I’m thinking that this unconscious can be perceived as the internet itself, which is working for you when you are not there. You come up with an amazing piece of writing, with something great to say, and you share it with the world and then go on to play with your little daughter. Or your dog. Or whatever you go to do, but in those moments the internet is working for you. Stuff is happening, without you even being aware of it, and that is the miracle of the way on which we live. It seems to be that the collective unconscious is more connected than ever, and the internet is the means for that connection to happen.

So yes, today, more than ever, the important thing is to just sit and Do The Work. Build some time for yourself so that you can navigate the dark waters of how it feels to show up, with the intention of manifesting the deepest truths that exist within you in the world. Through the act of creation itself. The endgame, the goal, is to be able to dissolve in the act of creation. To melt your whole being in it, so that the deepest of your truths can be manifested. For the unconscious to come forth as something that may not be conscious, because it happened through you. If you create something without even realizing what it is, it may end up having the consequence of cleaning your unconscious of many aspects of it that have been stored for long, long time. And that freedom is one of the best ways to live, because it is not conditioned in what other people may think of you from what you are doing.

Creativity is a consequence of the genius that is inside, and the purest expression of it comes when there is no attachment with the consequences of The Work. You just sit and do it for the sake of it. For the joy of doing it. You allow yourself to be transformed, and to navigate the uncharted waters of the unknown. In that sense, the artists are the ones that build up the roadmap for humanity. The creators are the one that are building out future, it is just that we are not able to see it with clarity yet. But that is what coming now, as AI becomes more and more prevalent. The need for people to express themselves in a different way, in a more sincere way, so that their unique spark can be brought up into the world. I may be biased with this because it is what I’ve been saying all this time, and it may be that I’m just repeating myself over and over. Without even embodying. Because I write about the act of creation being something that transforms you as an individual, but as I write that I’m very tired, even after sleeping all the time that I slept yesterday, and I’m not sure if I’m being transformed by what I’m doing or not.

Am I sure that I’m not? The answer to that question is also unclear. I mean, there is an aspect of myself that says that it is me playing the victim again, because I’m obviously being transformed. I’m opening the door to a new understanding of myself, one that comes from the exploration of everything that I have been, and everything that I am. This writing is the climax of my life, it is the way on which I manifest everything that I am in the world, and in that sense, it is time to be responsible with what I say and do and acknowledge that I am being transformed. It is just so hard to see. I meditate as I do and I don’t see the results in the material world. I breathe and I don’t see those results. But that is also me being the victim, once again, because I see the results. People are being helped by me. Maybe no one has read what I have written, but the unconscious consequence of what I’m doing here is being manifested through each other action that I bring into the world, and all those actions are pointing me towards something that is being shown. I have received amazing feedback from the people that I have guided through the breathwork sessions. I have been showing up with more and more clarity, and that is what is needed from me. Each one of these deep work sessions on which I sit down and write what is present is another way that I have found to anchor my consciousness into the present moment, to learn how to be, here and now, and that ends up having as a consequence that my being knows where to go towards. I’m training myself in presence, and it is in that presence that my deepest truth arises from.

I don’t know which is the ultimate truth, I haven’t reached that point and I don’t know if I will ever do, but what I know is that I’m walking towards a state of being that enables me more and more to be able to manifest my own truth through each one of my actions. And that truth is my presence. It is the transformation of all the experiences that I interact with into something new, something that arises from the depth of my being. It may be a creation, a set of words, an answer, a smile, whatever. But the work is to connect with whatever is, and have is a the thing that informs the answer with which I’ll decide to respond. I’m here to walk towards being more and more responsible for the consequences of my interactions, and for the interactions themselves. That is the road of consciousness, of being more and more aware. The one that is built on top of the understanding that it is only my reality that I can shape. It is only my relationship with life that I can explore as an avenue for connecting deeper and deeper with what is, right here, right now. I can’t change you, I can’t change anyone that I encounter, but I can only change myself through the act of becoming more and more of what I am. Or less and less of what I’m not. And what is it that I’m not? The doubts. The fear. The thoughts. The sensations. The feelings. I am what underlies all those things. I am what is behind them. I am the one that experiences them, and that is informed by those experiences. Nothing more, nothing less. And in this work that I’m doing here I’m walking towards something that is not an understanding. It is an embodiment. It is a manifestation. I’m not here to understand who I am. I’m here to be who I am. To express it to you. To transform myself through that beingness, because the more I do it the more ‘me’ I become. And that’s the ultimate bliss. Becoming myself.
Being myself. Realizing that I am myself. Loving that. Recognizing that I’m worthy of love, of attention, of caring. That just because of being I deserve it. I don’t have to do anything different than just realizing that. That I have always been loved, it is just the noise inside the head that won’t allow me to feel it, or experience it on my own flesh. It is so easy to think that the way on which love is brought is just by experiencing it in relation to other human beings. I receive love, therefore, I am loved. But I don’t think it works that way. I just am, and that is why I am loved. I’m not even clear with what I’m saying here, but I do know that there is a strong resistance within me to love myself. It has always been hard for me to love myself. And there has always been a need for me to demonstrate something to the world so that I can be loved. And all this time I have been working on that, so that I can become free of it.

Yesterday in my night meditation I had the sensation that there is something inside me that wants to be manifested, but it is as if it was a stream of energy that is bigger than the pipe on which it is trying to flow. And that difference brings up the tension that I feel inside. The pressure. And it was also clear that the way for relaxing that tension is just to give up the trying to fit it in there. Just allow myself to be, so that in that beingness all that tension can be dissolved into wat comes at the other side. I don’t know what it is, but I know that each day that passes there is a deeper understanding in myself that tells me that I’m doing things in a way that is conducing to be more present. And that is the way on which I’ll be able to integrate all this pressure into the full expression of my beingness. That is what comes as the information that I need right now. Give up the control. Each time that I think that what I’m doing is not working, that is an expression of me trying to control the outcome. I want things to be in a particular way, and that’s why I’m acting towards that way with what I say or do or write or try to manifest. I’m controlling, always, and it is time to give up that control. Use every outbreath, every circumstance on which I’m part of, to give that control. It is one of the most challenging things that I’ve encountered, but it is ok like that. It is part of what is. I’m learning each day how to give up. And it is not in doing something specific. It is not that I will learn ‘how’ to give up. It is not a how. It is just a beingness. In the beingness, there is a dissolution of the willingness for something to be different than what it is right now. It is in the beingness that my whole system will be able to dissolve this tension into my pure presence. It is in the beingness that I will be able to integrate everything that I am to transform it into everything that I will become. It is in the beingness that I am. And that I am is not dependant on the state of myself, it isn’t sleepy, hungry, sad, angry. It just is. All those other things are aspects of the polarization with which we have been living for all this time. The are just manifestations of something that needs to be integrated, so that the polarization is not there anymore. For it to be transcended. That’s the way on which I evolve, and you also. By integrating who you are through your actions. It is not something that you can think. You can’t think your way into this integration. It doesn’t work like that. The only thing you can do is actually integrate it, by just being. By just sharing with the world your truth, your own and particular truth. Whatever shape or size it has. Each one of us has his or her or it own truth. It will never help us evolve to think that my truth is more valid than yours. That is an aspect of division, that will end up generating something different from what the universe wants. It just wants us to move towards the pure expression of creativity through each and every one of our actions, and in that spirit, what is needed is for you to connect with your truth and live from there. Which is that truth? How does it look like for you?

I recall the other day when I was walking in the street and a guy started talking to me about jesus. He had found his truth in him, but he was trying to impose it in me without even expressing a bit of interest in what my truth is. He just asked me: Have you experienced Jesus? And from there he started preaching me whatever truth he experiences life from. And the problem there was that he was trying to convince me. That’s the thing with words, that’s why they are tricky, because there is an aspect in them of trying to convince someone that is very hard to hide. Am I trying to convince you about something now? Probably. But the biggest aim of my trying to convince you if for you to not need me anymore. My goal is that you stop reading this book, as soon as you can, and you go on and start creating something. What has worked for me is an intricate path of psychedelics, yoga, meditation, writing and having random conversations with people, but it may look completely different from you. I don’t know. It is part of what you have to discover, but what I want to tell you here is that the important part is the exploration. That is where all the joy comes from. From that opening that ends up bringing about the insights that are the information that you need to take the next step. And most of the times, that next step is closer than close. Think about how many times you have planned something that you will say in the future, when you meet someone. Then you meet that person and you absolutely forget what you were thinking of before. Or something that she says transforms your perception and you need to say something different. That happens a lot. You go through all these stories inside your head, thinking about the multiple different scenarios, just to open up the disappointment that you will feel when you encounter the truth that the other person also had something to say and everything that you prepared kind of melts away and fades as the other person starts being in front of you. Or even without another person.

It happens to a me a lot that I’m inside the process of meditation and I start going through all these stories of what I should do, and the actions I should take, and bla bla bla, just to end up discovering that at the end of it I don’t remember anything and all that time that I spent being distracted was just time that I was not able to give myself the amazing gift of being present with the truth of my being. Right there. I’m not in my truth because I’m riding the river of thoughts, of impermanence, of everything that is not real. And that’s why the power of these techniques is so important. As you walk the path of becoming more and more present in the act, your consciousness ends up being anchored to it. You become it, and in that becoming there is the deepest joy of life.

I don’t even know what Advaita Vedanta is. Or non-duality. Or whatever. I truly don’t know, and anything that I say comes from an experience of repeating like a parrot what someone else has said. I don’t have experience in these teachings, I’m just a random dude that has decided to explore what is real by jumping inside of his own experience. I don’t know how to point you towards anything, because I can’t explain it really. All of what I have done lately in my life has been exploring what feels right in the moment. Not what feels easy, or comfortable. What feels right. And right now, in this moment, what feels right is doing my breathwork and meditation sessions, and this writing. Who knows what will feel right in the coming weeks. In the coming years. It is crazy to think that there is so much ahead. I mean, maybe I’m doing me the biggest harm of them all and I’m just killing myself by standing with all that energy inside, but it definetly is worth the try. The amount of information that I’m getting of myself, of my relationship with life, with reality, doesn’t have any kind of comparison with anything that I had experienced before.

There are aspects of my being that are always active and making their noise, expressing their voice, but I’m getting closer and closer to the acknowledgment of those aspects and to the integration of them. And that integration looks like having an answer to give inside, and realizing that it is my command to take that answer or not. That is what being conscious, or responsible, is about. Realizing which is the consequence that something had on your being, and answering to that consequence with the mind anchored in being aware of it. Not just reacting to what was said with an unconscious pattern of action, but just being able to bring your truth into the table. To the conversation. That is what being conscious is. It doesn’t mean to be a guru meditating on the top of a mountain for many lifetimes, it is just about how can you have a better life by giving the ones with which you interact a pure expression of who you are. That is the game that needs to be played, and it is the one that each of us needs to play in order for us to evolve. Being witnesses of what is going on, and engaging in that with presence, with care, and with love.

What came to mind is the picture of all of humanity gathering to witness the unfolding of humanity from a perspective of not identification. This is something that is beyond me and you. It is beyond what we conceive. It is us, but in the broader sense, we are evolving. And we can’t even know how the process will look like. A baby when she is in the womb doesn’t know how it will look outside. There can’t be an understanding of that. It is the same for us, right here, right now, as we encounter the mysteries of what is to come. As we explore them. Not wanting to understand them, that is what creates friction, but just willing to experience them fully. Being present with whatever is present for you. And being truthful to your truth? When was the last time that you were truthful to your truth?

--

And what does that even mean? Being truthful to your truth? The understanding that I have right now in myself is related to being able to experience how it feels not to be truthful. I like the via negative, the approaching of the experiences that we go through in our own lives from the perspective of what is not. So here, it makes sense. I can speak about the sensations that come up to me when I’m not truthful to myself. There is something in there that wants to come out, and I’m not allowing it. So it stays there. Because the truth wants to come forth. It wants to be expressed, because it feels good. It feels natural. It feels like the way to go. And when it is not expressed, it rots inside. And it is infected with what came out that is not the truth. If I have a conversation with my partner and I’m not able to express my truth with her, what ends up happening is that what came out makes more noise than the one that the truth would have made. And the whole goal of this thing is to bring that noise down. Let the experience flow from a place of no-noise, from a place of space, of openness. The truth feels open. If I share with you my truth, I’m opening it so that I can live from there. If I don’t, there is a closing that goes on, and it ends up being not conducing to the pure expression of your being, in whatever you are doing.

And that is the world in which I’m living as I write these words. One on which people are not living from their truth. They are living through the truth that has been embedded in their experience, the one that they have been told is true, but they have not been able to dig (their) reality towards the understanding of how their own and particular truth looks like. I don’t like doing this kind of thing here, I feel weird. It doesn’t truly help, because it is criticizing. And each day that goes by I feel less inspired to criticize for the sake of it, I just want to talk from my own experience so that I can take it out. That was a thought that came to me clearly in the morning, as I was thinking about this people that generalize in society and tell that ‘we are like this’, ‘they are like that’, etc. Yesterday in the park I met a guy from Cuba that started telling me that in Santiago people are not as open as in other places, because it is a big city, and bla bla bla. I wonder: Why is it that people enjoy so much creating these labels for the places to where they go? Which is the role that doing that plays in their psyche?

I remember when I was travelling around the world on my own and suddenly I met someone after being in Split (Croatia) that asked me: How is the people Split? As soon as I got that question, I realized that I can’t even answer it for the neighborhood on which I was born. How can I have an understanding of it if it is not something fixed. It is something that depends on the experience that you have in the place, and that experience is always changing because by definition it will never be the same. It is always dependent on how you approach people, who you approach, what happened today for them, etc. So I think that when we place these labels on places we eventually end up harming humanity at large. Because we close the door for exploration. If I ask you: ‘How is the people in New York?’. The only thing I do is to bring into my field of awareness an expectation of what I should experience when I relate to people there, and that bias will end up informing the way on which I experience that place. I think it is much healthier in the long term to ask questions that don’t end up building fictional labels on top of people that don’t deserve it. Because there will always be an outsider, in any place that you can categorize as full of ‘bad’ people, there will always be one that has more tendency for ‘good’ than the others, and if we label the whole group as bad we lower the chance of this person to bring her magic into the collective so that it can be transformed from there. I truly believe that labels are harming society, and that’s why I fight so hard in myself to not label me as anything. The only label that fits me is the one that comes from each action that I do. When you label me you fix me in time and space. I cease to be a verb. I cease to exist as I like existing (as pure beingness) and I become what you want me to become. This feels constraining, and I don’t like it at all. It feels good to at least have the willingness to move towards a different direction, and that’s what I did yesterday when I went to the park. I just opened myself to whatever it brought me in the image of people that would approach it, and in that sense, it was perfect. There will always be people that will make you smile and others that won’t. Who are the ones that you are going to decide to give your energy to? It is your choice, you know. At the end of the day, consciousness follows attention, and if you keep giving your attention to what is not helping you evolve, you’ll keep being stuck in the same patterns of action that we’ve always been in. Open to the unknown, just by exploring how it feels to go to a place that you know nothing about.

Writing that makes me think: Why is it that humans love biases so much? If someone goes to New York, most of the times they want to know what to do there, what to expect. There goes the expectations, you know? People tend to want to go to places because they build in their own minds expectations related to what those places will bring into their experience. That is crazy. All these expectations doing their work to build up the experience of reality that we end up sharing as a collective. Is it that culture is built on top of expectations? Is it that culture is the sum of how we expect each other to behave? I don’t know, it is just a thought process. I don’t have enough information to ask this question seriously, but I definitely have enough experience in my being to talk about what I’m talking about.

I have been in the unknown many, many times.

I booked my tickets to india to the city where they were the cheapest, and I arrived there without knowing anything about the city (Hyderabad). I went out of the airport and took the first bus that I found, without even caring where it led me to. I just wanted to explore. I just wanted to throw myself into the unknown. And it ended up being a feather bed, you know. Everything that happened in that trip was a feather bed, one that did remind me how amazing it is to not have expectations. To let life surprise you. Over and over again. Just by exploring how it feels. Now that I look back, those moments where almost empty of expectations. I mean, I did experience them from the perspective of duality, there was definitely a separation between my perception of ‘I’ and the rest of the universe, but within that separation there was unity. There was a belonging in myself that was built through each person with which I interacted. Each smile that I came across. Each sound that the street brought into myself. Each smell that I felt. Those were all cues that connected me to what was going on around me, and I truly felt connected. Inspired. Open. Willing to explore the void. And it spoke back with clarity. With the clarity that comes from knowing that everything is going to be alright, that I’m in the right place, in the right moment. So many good memories in those places. I don’t feel comfortable with telling stories, and I definitely think that those stories would also end up being something that build up biases on your experience. If I tell you what happened, it won’t escape your mind, and if you ever go to India part of your experience will be informed by what you have read here. And I don’t want that to happen. I want to invite you to become free from the experiences of others, and build your own and unique experience. That is the game that we are playing here. That is the game that is being explored. The one of trusting, the one of being open. The one of taking risks, the one of becoming friends with the unknown. That is the source of pure joy. The unknown. The absence of expectations. Help yourself to become free from them, and allow life experience itself through the wonders of what comes when there is no expectations. When there is only willingness to live. Through your eyes and the eyes of others.
We are awareness having an experience as human beings, that is what the parrot that is writing tells myself all the time. It is easy to say that without having realized it. It is easy to be the parrot, you know. It is easy to say stuff without embodying it, because no one is judging me. At least right now. I don’t have to face what comes from being judged. I’m not exposing myself, and it feels safe. Of course it feels safe. It is just part of what it is. And I want it to be, more and more, by stop running in circles. That is what I have been doing all this time, just running in circles, over and over again. Repeating the same message in different words. The same and simple message that has been told in the history of humanity in different ways.

Know yourself.

I only know that I don’t know.

It is all just part of the same equation, of the same exploration. It all is part of the same exploration, it is what comes at the other side of opening for that exploration to happen and witnessing what is present when that is done. I’ll keep saying that the tools that I’ll be pushing forward – meditation, breathwork and the creative act – are the ones that make more sense to me, but I’m open to change wherever I want. I’m not fixed. I’m not static. I’m just a force of nature that is finding his way through the infinite maze of what is going on in the world, and that force can be transformed into whatever shape or size or form that feels like. I’m a chameleon, and the only thing that I cannot change is who I truly am. I cannot change my truth. I can only polish everything that is related to the way on which that truth is displayed and experienced by myself so that it can then be conveyed with more clarity to others. As you may guess, that is probably the biggest challenge that I’m facing right now, in this moment of my life. Clarity, and the capacity to reach people with a message that is concise. Focused. With the fog lifted. Truthful. I’m done with not being truthful to myself. I’ll keep walking the road towards not changing that, but experiencing life from the other side. From how it actually feels to be truthful.

Changing what is wrong is a process that requires a different kind of energy than building the new. I’m tired of criticizing, I’m just open to build the new. I’m here to do that. To bring everything that I am into the creative process. Not the critic process. The creative one. I’m here to learn how to perceive with more clarity what is within my domain of action, so that from there I can push forth whatever feels complete in my understanding of the current means for action. I’m here to build, not to destroy. Let what is wrong be rotten by the worms of inaction, of it not given more energy to. Let the new world be built on top of giving energy to the new, not giving more energy to the old. Let us build the new world by offering all our gifts and offerings and wonders to what is going to bring more joy and connection and love to the world, instead of eliminating what is bringing depression and despair and all the other crazy things that can be seen everywhere.

Are we going to live in a world on which duality is not a part of the way on which we decide? How does the world look like when we are all awake? Which are the foundations of culture? As above, so below, so I truly wonder how does the perspective of those that ‘got it’ inform the answer of these questions. Who are we when there is no duality in the perception that we have of reality? My guess is that we are pure creative expression. As robots automate all the tasks that are done repetitively, more and more of us are enabled to manifest the uniqueness that we bring into the world by allowing our creative expression to flow through us. I’m being over biased here maybe, but that’s just how I feel. There are moments on which I feel that I’m living in the future, that I’m just experiencing life from the perspective of someone that has had the privilege to ‘see’ where we are heading to, and that’s why I put this kind of emphasis in the tools that I consider the most important ones for the process of evolution of humanity.

As we show up to Do The Work, we end up opening the possibility for new things to happen. For life to be manifested in the consequence of the work that we do. For the universe to show itself through whatever we end up creating. And that consistency is what ends up building what is needed as the means for the internal alchemy that will show you what you need to see, that will make you experience what you need to experience, in order to become more of who you have always been. Each one of these sessions is an encounter with the depth of your being, it is an openness into what is there when you are not there anymore. When you allow each aspect of your being to shine forth, through the act of creation itself. For me, that process unfolds through writing. Bringing into this page every word that ends up being a story that speaks about what is present, right here, right now. It is just by being myself in these sessions that I allow the openness to come. It is just by connecting with my truth, whatever it may look like, that I become more of what I have always been. It is just by letting it flow through my actions that I better understand who I am.

I discover who I am by interacting with people like you, and that’s precisely what I’m doing here. Interacting with someone like you, without knowing who you are, without caring too much because it is just what is. It doesn’t really matter what is. Anything that I could say as something that matters related to what is is a conceptualization related to what should be. And that’s the whole goal of everything that has been written until now, you know: To eliminate that word from my vocabulary. Nothing should be. Everything just is. And it is perfect like that. The one that perceives it in a different way is not who I am. It is the one that I’m not. There goes the parrot again, trying to trick myself into thinking that I’m something that I’m not. Running through the maze. Going round and round and round in the maze. It feels good down here, and it is getting weirder and weirder. But I like it that way, I’ve always been kind of weird.
