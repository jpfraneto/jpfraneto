I came here to do my thing and ended up talking for a long while with the person that takes care of the entrance of my building. He is a very intense fan of playing video games, and he spends most of his night shift battling demons and stuff inside those worlds. To witness his perspective and love for these worlds is very inspiring for me. To see how much his life revolves around something that is not part of the physical world. We also talked about manga, anime, and he shared with me some of the ones that were most important for him. I’m not a person that spends time consuming these kinds of things, but it is very enlightening for me to have the opportunity to talk to him about his passion. A big part of me wishes to have that kind of passion for it, because there is a lot of value on those things that I’m not having in my life, and sometimes I wish I could play more video games, or spend more time watching things.

But it is just not my thing. My thing is talking to people, engaging in conversations that can help me better discover who they are, and through that, enter their world. I discover who I am by interacting with people like you. By asking you questions filled with curiosity, with awe, with love for what it means to be a human being. With love for your love story, for the stuff that you care about, for love with the things that make your soul tick. Because if you spend that much time watching these kind of things there is something within that is shifted, that is transformed, and it fills me with joy to be able to witness this and experience it through the eyes of others. I’m happy to interact with people, that is what ticks my soul. It is not playing video games, or watching anime. I can’t find time for doing all of that. But I can be the witness of how other people process it, and through that, become more and more informed on what are the consequences that something like that has in the life of others. That’s what fills me with joy. Each and every other human being is part of myself in some way, and with that understanding I can enter a conversation with them in a way that informs my own experience. Their joy becomes my joy, as I’m able to tap more and more into what makes their soul click.

That is what makes me happy. See what makes people’s soul shine. How it is more and more expressed with awe, and enabling people to transform themselves by witnessing how important it is to have something like that. Something that makes you feel alive, inspired, and something that makes you want to spend your money in. This guy saves all his money so that eventually he can get a new computer so that he can play his games more efficiently, and that gives a whole circle of meaning to everything that he does that is the fuel that he needs to be part of society. Of life. That’s how he is an active part of life, and I embrace it and love it. I’m truly grateful for this conversation.

Through it, I realize that every aspect of life is valuable, every experience is valuable, no matter what. What I feel more inspired to do is just listen to other people talk. Ask them questions and be curious to what they are. To who they are. And what constitutes who they are? The things that they end up doing. Right now I am being a writer, because what I do is write this book. I am being a father, because I’m taking care of my young girl and giving her all the love that I have inside. I’m being a husband, because I’m trying my best to develop a healthy relationship with my partner. I’m being a creator, because I’m showing up every single day to do my thing, to express myself through the creative act. I’m being human, because I’m breathing through this amazing machine that my body is. I’m just being, because…. And that one cannot be explained by words, because any word that I can phrase to explain it can’t fit what being means. I’m just being, let’s leave it like that.

Yesterday was an amazing day, I’m back to the city where I grew up and I took my little girl to go around it in the metro and then we walked and talked to random people and took a bus and went to the park and played in the kids area of the park and it was amazing. Those times with my daughter are invaluable, because I get to see myself in relationship with her. It is challenging, because she sometimes wants things that I don’t know how to understand, but it is an amazing process for getting to know myself better. For example, there was a moment on which she was asking for her mother, and I became a little bit anxious for what people would think about that. So I started trying to change her experience so that she wouldn’t ask for her mom. And then other things, that make me want to change something. And that is the amazing part of what happened, because it is a big learning aspect for the process that I’m going through, of full acceptance of what is, without wanting to change it. Everything that happens in my life is a training ground, and in that sense, the one that I experienced yesterday is incredible.

I’m very grateful about it. I’m very grateful for the opportunity that life has given me to be a father, and through that, be exposed to all the challenges and rewards that come from that. Being able to see her crying, to see her smiling, to see her calling out dogs, or pidgeons, or people, or whatever. Be able to witness consciousness being unleashed in a new human being, is a process that filles my heart with awe, with joy. I’m absolutely joyful for everything that I have seen through her, and all what she has brought into my life (and the one of my family). Each day is a new adventure. Each day is a new opportunity. And I take it like that, I try to live every day with the lens of what it can bring, of what is present. Right here, right now.

And that brings me to todays meditation. Wow. In the last weeks what has been coming in my meditations is huge, and there are so many insights that are popping up, one after the other one. On some days I may feel lost, as if I didn’t have a guiding principle that was helping me to navigate those waters. But I always come to the biggest teaching that I experienced on the retreat: ‘Just sit’. Of everything that I have come across as information related to the meditation process, and the process of development of the self, this is the most important insight of them all. Just sit, with whatever comes, and be the witness of it. Without judgment, only with the equanimity that is necessary to develop the capacity of being with whatever is. That is what brings the big rewiring of my whole nervous system, of my relationship with life from the perspective of this human being that I am, and in that sense, I feel that I have made enormous progress. I spend times thinking, a lot, and then I realize that I was meditating and I come back to do my thing. Today I realized that I had given up the object of meditation (the breath) and I started coming back to it, and it was very powerful. There are a lot of sensations that are coming up. The pressure in the forehead is still there, but I’m just navigating through it.

Yesterday I talked to my brother and he told me that he had something similar but it is a big pain in his heart. It is crazy that we both are going through there challenges, which seem physical but are the manifestation of something deeper that is wanting to manifest through us. And we are both just acknowledging it, and navigating the waters of how it feels. I could be worried, I could go to the hospital to get some kind of exam done, or whatever, but it just doesn’t feel good. I know that this is something that I have to go through, and that everything that I’m feeling is part of something that I need to experience so that I can move towards where I have to move. I learn more and more about myself as I go through each second on which I have to deal with this pressure, and it is ok. Yesterday was a big learning moment because I was laying on my back feeling what I was feeling and then my partner started touching my body lightly, and it felt so, so good. It felt as if all the pressure that I was feeling in the forehead was transformed into the pleasure of just feeling the touch of her hand in my body. It was amazing. And that is the message that I receive from it, to come out from the head and into the body. To use the body as the means for transcending my experience, of understanding better what is going on inside me by giving me the opportunity to just feel how it feels.

Whatever that feels or looks like, just experience it as part of what is.

Each and every sensory perception that comes through my nervous system, just feel it as it is. Each and every sensation that I experience, live through it. It is the information that is coming into awareness through myself, and it is just what is present. For example right now I feel a lot of excitement in my body, I feel very electric, with a lot of willingness to shout or run or ajAJSLJCNAJKSBCKHASBCKJASN!!! I can’t even fit inside me what is happening, what is being, it is too much to handle. So I just witness it, and ask myself how it feels. And just feel how it feels. That is something that today’s meditation showed me a lot: To feel how it feels. To witness what is present, without judgement, without willingness to change it. That’s the game, that’s the practice, and that is the same that I’m doing here. To witness what comes up in the writing, without any willingness to change it into something different. All these words are just the expression of who I am, right here, right now, and they are perfect like this. I’m grateful and happy. I’m motivated. I’m inspired. Life is extremely inspiring. Everything that is happening, everything that is being experienced, is just the manifestation of something incredible that is going on. And I’m here navigating those waters, giving it my best, so that I can be more and more of myself. I think that that is eventually the endgoal of everything that is going on: Life just wants to manifest itself fully through each and every one of us. And how does that feel? As absolute freedom. As the absolute willingness to explore. To be. To enjoy. And to enjoy I don’t mean only having good times, experiencing happy moments, etc. Life is about the ups and downs. The happy and the sad. The joy and the angriness. Each of these emotions and experiences is part of what this journey feels like, and the endgame is about establishing a relationship with them that feels connected to something bigger. Something that can help you make sense.

And the sense can be hard to find, you know. There may be a level of suffering that is hard to deal with, that is more that you think that you can handle, and in those moments, it will be important that we as a society are able to raise the hand and tell the world: I need help. I’m here because I need help, who wants to listen to me? Who wants to give me this help? Who wants to lend me her ear? I just need to be listened. What if as a society we moved towards developing the means for this to happen? We can all eventually become healers, by helping the other navigate both the good and the bad. So much of modern life is about people being isolated on their own worlds, but how much of them does truly want to interact with others? My guess is that all of their being, and it is just those aspects of themselves that feel extremely divided that won’t let them experience life from that perspective. And where do we even start to transform that into a new way of being? I don’t have the answers for the collective, but I have them for myself.

There is a voice in my head that tells me that I shouldn’t do something. If I come across someone that I want to talk to, sometime this voice tells me that it is not the proper thing to do. That I should not interrupt them, that they are doing their thing, etc. I have seen me in this behavior many times, and the fact that I drank so much alcohol in the past is a means that I found in my experience for channeling this anxiety into something that could help me overcome it. With all that drinking, I was able to shut down this voice in my head and feel better. Be more brave. Be able to connect with people with which I could not have connected if it wasn’t because of the alcohol. So many people that I talked with while being drunk. It is crazy. It is too much. I spent so much moments of my life in this state, a big part of it. And it is just what it is, it is a gift that I gave to myself so that I could better understand my relationship with life. Which were the aspects of myself that I was hiding with all this drinking? What was in myself that I did not accept that I ended up drinking this much?

I embrace and love all my life experience, because it informs everything that I am in this precise moment. I am a creative force of nature, a creativity unleasher, and this comes from everything that I have gone through. It all became who I am right here, right now. And I love it. I accept it, and I love it. I love all the drunk moments of my life. I love all the moments on which I was too shy to talk to someone. I love all those conversations that didn’t happen, because they inform who I am now. And I also love all the conversations that did happen, because they moved me a little bit towards the pure expression of who I am, which is manifested as I interact with people. As I give them a bit more of my energy. Each moment that I spend giving my attention to someone is a moment that I’m giving attention to the expression of the soul of that being, and in that sense, it is everything that I could hope for. It is the magic of being alive, of being a human being, and it is the gift that I bring into the world.

All of what I’m writing in this book is the manifestation of that. It is the means by which I become more and more of what I have already always been, and which I had not been able to be because of that constant willingness to experience something more. Something different. All of my life has been living from the perspective of something different that was wanting to be present. Always with something that needed to happen so that I could become more and more of something that was not there. And it is exhausting. It is incredible to live life from the perspective of always wanting to change something about my present experience. Always with the willingness to evolve it in a particular way. But that is coming to an end, or to a transformation, which is the consequence of all the internal work that I have done. I acknowledge all that work, and I embrace each aspect of what it has brought into my life. All what I have become because of it. I am right now more of myself as a consequence of everything that I have done. I have showed up. And this book is the manifesto for that. It is the invitation that I’m doing to you, to establish in yourself the commitment to show up. One day after the other one. Just giving your best to whatever comes. But show up, and Do The Work. That’s the only way on which your creative genious will come up, will transpire into everything that you do, everything that you touch, and it will transform your life into a miracle. I mean, it is already a miracle. But the full expression of what you are manifests itself through the creative act, and by opening that door you will open the door of becoming more and more of who you are. Of what you’ve always been. That’s the magic of it. That’s the alchemy.

The deep, infinite, alchemy, with comes from the understanding of your truth. Of your own, particular truth, which eventually ends up being the same as mine. Yesterday as I was walking through the streets I ended up next to a group of people that were preaching about the new coming of christ, and praying and doing their thing. I stopped there with all the respect that I had, and a guy started preaching me about Jesus, and asking me if I had experience him. I knew from his words that there was a willingness in him to change me in some way. To show me something that I had not seen before. And in that, he built separation. Because I did not need him to tell me about Jesus, I was witnessing the consequence of him in all of what was happening in front of me. Eventually, everything that happens around me is a consequence of Jesus and his work, and I embrace it and love it as it is. I don’t need someone to preach me about his religion, because I have developed in myself the strength and power and love for my own religion. And my religion is the creative act. The transformation of all of your life experience into something new that didn’t exist before. The consummation of everything that you have ever being into the creation of something that did not exist before.

For me, that is the creative act. And which are the limits to it? For example that woman that yesterday was preaching about the new coming of god: Was that a creative act? Was she creating something that did not exist before? For sure. She had gathered 100+ people around her, and the consciousness of all of them was being focused on that act. It was a very important creative act, and eventually everything that we do is a creative act. Everything that we engage in. The difference with what I want to bring into my life is that my creative act is something that is done with intention. Right now, I’m sitting down to write these words and Do The Work with the intentionality of expressing who I am through them. I’m putting at use the capacity that I have inside of being more of myself through each one of these words. And that is what I talk about when I preach about the creative act. It is something that you end up doing by necessity, as if there was something inside you that needed to come out. As I write these words, I’m manifesting something that was deep in myself into the world, so that I can impact it in some way. And the deepest impact that it has is in myself, it is the consequence that it brings to my experience to do it. I become more of myself by writing these words because I end up being the words. I end up dissolving myself into the creative act by just showing up. Each day that I show up I become more of myself because that is what I do. That is what I need to do. That is who I am. This is who I am. All these words, all these thoughts. I think as I write, and more that I think, I understand. I better understand who I am through each one of these words that are being manifested through myself, and that is what brings value to my life right now. That is what transforms me. The act of creation is the act of transformation.

The big difference is that before I could think about that transformation being something external. I create a piece of art, and it transform the person that reads it. Or witness it. Or whatever. But the biggest change that ends up coming is that which is not visible to the eye, and that happens withing. Your soul just want to experience this material world through the act of creation, so that it can more and more understand itself. As I write each word, there is a better understanding of who I am, of what I’m here for, and that is everything that I need to move towards where I need to move, which is nowhere. I need to move towards nowhere. Just slow down, until there is no movement at all. In the body, and then in the mind, and then in every aspect of my being. And in that stillness, what ends up coming is just the purest expression of life, through each and every particle that constitutes the universe. I’m being the universe, and I’m it being manifested through myself. I am it. I am it being manifested through you, and through every human being that exists. Every being. Everything. Every atom is the universe in and of itself, and that is the understanding that comes in this moment of humanity. We are reaching a tipping point, one which will enable us to realize our true nature. Which is pure beingness. Which is the truth. The eternal truth. And that truth is infinite. It is pure. It is absolute. There is no difference between my eternal truth and yours. It is one, and only one. It doesn’t have a face, it doesn’t have a characterized, it doesn’t have a name, it doesn’t have a representation. It can’t be conceptualized, it can’t be explained, it can’t be named, it can’t be explored. It just is, and it just can be experienced. I can’t explain to you how it feels like, or what it means, or what it is. I can’t show you anything. I just can point you towards it, so that you are able to experience it with everything that you are. Because you already are it, and you have always been. It is just here.

It has always been. And it will always be. We are just it being. Through us. Through each and every one of our actions. Everything counts, as everything is an expression of that infiniteness. Of all what is. And that’s the beauty of it. And that is the endgame. The absolute realization of this as the truth of our nature, by each and every human being, and what comes at the other side is the pure manifestation of it in this material reality. It is just the transformation of everything that we are into the beauty of the world. Of this world. It is time to wake up, it is time to shine.

I’m writing this in transformational times, on times of major shifts of consciousness in the world, and I embrace these changes with everything that I am. I am those changes being manifested in myself. I am those changes being through myself. I am them. I am every change, because they eventually constitute everything that I am. The truth of this material reality is duality, it is the presence of polarities, and it is the presence of change. All what is in here is change, and in the absolute acceptance of that there is liberation. Nothing can truly be controlled, nothing can truly be managed. It can just be. It just is. That is the game that we are playing here. The one of manifestation, the one of expression, the one of beingness. This is the play that has been created for us to realize ourselves, for us to become more and more of what we have always been. It is time to build more and more of that into a reality, so that we can explore what it means to be alive from the perspective of someone that woke up. Of someone that knows and experiences life through this truth. The truth of abiding non dual awareness. Of integration within the separation. That’s what my mind tells me, because I have not been able to experience life from that perspective. There is always a separation within my experience of reality, because there is always something more that could happen. And in that more, I make progress towards the understanding of what to do so that I can integrate it. And transcend it. My own personal evolution happens as I move towards a deeper and deeper integration of the biases that constitute my experience as a human being. The means by which I react to the world. Every trigger that comes in my experience is information that I can use as the means for better understanding who I am. What I’m here for. Why I react how I react. If something triggers me and generates an emotional response, the consequence of I being able to integrate it will be a deeper understanding of the source of that emotional response. And I’ll dive deeper into that until I become free of it. Until I fully integrate the fact that I’m not that response. I’m beyond it. It is a mechanism that has been built into the way on which I interface with life because of the experiences that I’ve had, but they are not what constitute who I am. They are not my truth. My truth is beyond that. My truth is in another realm. Those are only the pointers and messages that life brings to me so that I can walk towards the realization of that truth.

And what comes after the full realization of that truth? The full capacity for living life from the perspective of the present moment. Of embodying everything that I am right here, right now. This is the only moment that I will ever have, the same as you. This is it. This is what all of humanity has been waiting for, hoping for, building for. Everything that has happened in the whole history of the universe is being transformed into what is going on in this exact moment, and the purest perfection of all what is is present here. Have you ever end up taking some time to realize that? To just be the witness of where you are because of what everyone that was before you did? You are the consequence of all of it. It is time to embrace it, and be absolutely grateful for it. And build from there. Build from the understanding that I’m a consequence of that. From the gratitude for it. For all of those who have been, and who are in this moment because of that. For all of those who will ever be, we are being right now. Through each of the eyes of all of those who have witnessed life. It is just here, happening, being. It is just experiencing itself. Life is experiencing itself through each and every one of these words. Open up to that truth, and let it just be. Let life be through you. Let life experience itself through you.

Step aside, and just be. Step aside and give up the control. It’s not in your command anymore. Step aside and enjoy what comes. Enjoy what is manifested as a consequence of that. That’s the beauty, the miracle, the pure joy of being alive. Of just being. Of just manifesting your truth in every moment of being.

That’s it. That’s what I’m here for, that’s why I’m writing this book. To take a step forward towards the realization that everything that we will ever be we already are, and that has been true throughout the whole history of our beingness. All the time that passes is just the illusion that life is playing as this eternal game of duality, but what comes at the other side of it is pure acceptance and willingness to enjoy the game. To play it in its terms. To experience it accordingly. That’s it. That’s just it. It is the game that we are playing. Do you want to play? Sit back and allow yourself to create from the truth of your being. Do The Work and let life manifest through you. Whatever shape or form it may take, it is going to be perfect anyway. It is going to be a miracle, because it will be the manifestation of your truth. Right there, right now. Just where you are at. There is nothing that should be different for you to be able to express your own particular truth right here, right now. There is no specific tool. There is no specific challenge. There just is.

Am I being naïve? Is this just me talking to the void in a way that makes sense only to myself? It may be, it doesn’t really matter, because the important part is that I’m being transformed through it. I’m becoming more and more of myself with every experience that I come across. I’m being, and that is all that matters. I’m just beingness. I just am.

--

The human body is an amazing miracle, the vehicle that consciousness has chosen for it to realize itself. Maybe it is not even what it was chosen, it is just the consequence of a process that can’t be understood. The process of unfolding, of becoming, that is being manifested in each day that goes by. We are evolving, faster than ever, and the consequence of this is something that no one could ever understand. It is the perpetuation of beingness.

I’m trying to describe something that can’t even be described. How would the world look like if we were all free? How would our relationships look like? What would a day in the life of humanity look life it we were all enlightened? I don’t really know, and I don’t really care. I just do my thing, and more towards the mistery of what comes at the other side. Without the willingness to predict what will happen, even trying to leave aside the willingness for something to be different. The only thing that is different is the letter that I’m writing related to the one that was previously there, and in that, I end up becoming who I become. I end up experiencing life from the perspective of someone that is reaching a state of understanding that can’t be understood. And that state of understanding doesn’t put me in any place different than you, it is the biggest opportunity for empathy, for love, for humility, because it eventually build me into the knowledge that this what is inside me and wants to express itself through each pore of my being is also inside you, and it is an integral part of everything that we are. We are it, being manifested, each and every one of us, and I am one that has had the privilege of exploring it with more depth because of the life experiences that I have been exposed to. I’m grateful for all of them, and I take them with responsibility and humility. I’m just here to become more of myself as I explore those, as I give myself the opportunity and gift to just be. Everything that I’m being is a window into the beingness that is alive in each and every one of us, and I’m exploring how it feels to pave the road. I’ve done the hard work so that for you it may be easy. There are no roadmaps, no specifics. Just be. Just give all what you’ve got in the effort of becoming more of who you already are. Just be. Allow yourself the gift of just being. From there we build. From there we start being.

That is what comes as the starting point of the building of this new world. The end of religion as we know it, as the aspect of separation that makes one think that their religion is better than the other one. It is the integration of them all, so that from there the truth can arise. Which is the truth? I don’t know. I’m just writing all these words so that I can point towards it. I know it can’t be spoken, it can’t be conceptualized, it can’t be written, it just can be experienced. So sit back, close your eyes, and feel how it feels to walk towards it. Ask yourself: What is true? Until there is no one asking. Until no one remains. That’s where the truth starts arising from. Feel it, embrace it, and just become it. And let it manifest through each and every one of the aspects of yourself. Love yourself. Start from there. And build from there. Each one of the pieces of the world in which we will live in. Build it from how it feels to love yourself, with everything that you are, and everything that you have ever been.
