There is an aspect of this game of writing a book, and the way on which I’m doing it, that is very similar to the self inquiry dyads that I practiced in the retreat at the Samadhi Center. In them, you sit across a person, stare deeply into her eyes and prompt her with the inquiry: ‘Tell me who you are’. The idea is for that person to feel everything that is brought to her existence, right in that moment, from that inquiry, and just report what is going on inside. For me, coming here to write, is kind of the same. There is an aspect of me that each time that I think about what I will write, realizes that that is a thought, and lets it go. I don’t want to overthink ‘what I will write about’. I just want to come here and do it. That’s the way on which I have been doing this work, and it feels good to do it like that. It is bringing more and more of my sincerity, of my truth, and that is what I need to do to bring out what is hidden deep in there.

Today as I started my morning meditation there was a thought in there related to having eaten chocolate yesterday. My body felt bad because of it, there were sensations of nausea and other ones that are not comfortable, so there was the judgement present as always. So I just witnessed the thught and let it go, realizing that it was part of what was present, and allowing it to be. Not giving it more energy than it deserved. And it felt great, I was able to move through with other things, and the meditation got deeper and deeper. I was not able to do the full hour in one sit because I had to go to the toilet, but it was a great one anyway. Today is the birthday of my wife, and what is present in me is to consciously make the transition towards not complaining more about the decisions that I make. Be ok with them, embrace them, and move on with them. If I decide to eat something and then feel like shit, so be it, but don’t complain (with myself and with her) about it, because the only thing that I’m transferring to her is insecurity.

Which are the decisions in your life that have had the biggest impact? Do you regret them? This thing about the whole spiritual movement makes noise inside me most of the times, because they say that everything happens for a reason and all that, but: Is it really what I needed to go through? It is easy to say after the fact that everything happens for a reason. But was the reason worth it? Was what I have gone through worth all the pain that happened because of it? Maybe it doesn’t make sense to think about it because it is part of reality, but it is the noise that is around my existence at this moment, and this is the way on which I acknowledge it.

I was not able to write more today, and it is ok like that. This is how I make peace with that fact, with that reality.
