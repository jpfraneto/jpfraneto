New journey of exploration into the self, now at a new time of the day. I don’t often come to do my thing in the afternoon, at the end of the day, because I’m tired and with my energy in a mood that brings me closer to be with my daughter or just cleaning the kitchen or reading a book or doing something in the house. Something that connects me with the mundane, with the simple things of just doing what is needed to maintain the house in order.

But today was a very special day, an important one, and I could not come here earlier. I did a breathwork session that was one of the most intense and important experiences that the person that went through it had had in her life. She brought that kind of feedback to me, and that connects me with the importance of what I’m doing. To the impact that it is having. It is amazing, and I’m inspired to become better and better at it because it is something that is bringing clear benefits to the people that I’m working with. And that means wonders to me. And for them. And for the world. She told me that she didn’t know how to pay me for it, and I know that the most important way on which she can do it is just by allowing me to do it. Offering me the opportuinity to have someone like her to trust me, and with that, engage in that process with me. Because it is a process, we are just 2 sessions in, and it is likely to have a lasting impact. I mean, that is what I’m bringing to this whole thing, and my willingness is to open the door to transform people into more and more of who they are. Who they always have been.

That’s what the session was about, about becoming more of who she has always been. About embodying very aspect of her being in her whole being, and with that, live life at its full potential. I’m convinced that with all the unconscious patterns of behavior that people have in their experience as human beings there is a lot of energy that is wasted on perpetuating them, and the most important work that we can do is to make each one of those behaviour conscious so that all that energy can be used in a new way. Towards the absolute expression of creativity. Of beingness. In whatever you are doing. It doesn’t matter what it is, the only thing that matters is that it happens. Just allow yourself to be creative, and it eventually becomes a necessity. I had not been able to come and write today, and I felt that a big part of me was missing. There is something that needs to be brought out of me, and here is where I’m doing it. This is the place that I have built for myself to do that.

And part of me makes me think that that is a story that I tell myself. That I don’t actually enjoy too much the process of coming here to write, but I do it anyway because it is the prison that I built for myself. I don’t know, that’s part of this eternal maze of my own mind on which I’m in. But I know that it feels good to look back and see everything that has happened. All what has been built, created. All the words that have come up. All the experiences that have been manifested as a chain of words that end up making some sense. Or not. I don’t know, it has been a long time since the last day on which I read what I write. I prefer not to do it anymore, I just let it out and see what comes at the other side. That is the game that I’m playing right now, and it is ok. It is working. I know it is.

But in spite of all the words that I can say related to ‘it working’, there is still a small doubt inside myself. Because what I’m going through is incredibly intense, you know. Right now, as I write these words, there is a pressure inside my forehead that makes me feel as if my head was going to explode. As if there was too much energy present in there that doesn’t know where to flow to, how to move. There is an aspect within myself that knows that that energy is the most intelligent one of the universe and it knows where to flow to, but there are still doubts in place because it is so brutal. What is going on is brutal, you know. But here I am, giving my best. I know in the bottom of my heart that everything will be alright, because life is giving me messages.

Yesterday I went to the wedding of a friend with which we have many, many common friends, and the way on which I approached every interaction makes me feel that I’m doing well. The moment that makes me more happy was one on which the father of a friend, which I respect a lot, passed by an tapped by back and told the other guy that I was talking to: ‘This is a great one.’. And he said that not because of the image that he had of myself, not because of what someone had told him about me, but because of the interaction that we had had before. I was genuinely interested on his story, and asked him questions that reflected this. And those questions made him feel emotions, and that is my mission here. To help people go deep, to help people experience emotions. To help bring out what has not been able to come out. And the fact that he was able to recognize this and make it clear to me in that way means a lot. It means that I’m walking towards the right direction. And all the interactions that I had yesterday make me feel like that. I felt good. Grounded. Embodied. I spite of all the crazy sensations that I have inside and that I don’t really know how to deal with and that sometimes make me feel as if there was something wrong, in spite of all the times on which my breath has been too shallow, to slow, to different from what is ‘normal’, I know that everything is ok. I trust the underlying intelligence of the universe, and I trust that everything that is happening is for a greater good. I just need to work on developing the capacity of not trying to rationalize, not trying to deal with this whole thing with the mind. Develop the capacity to be with others, to truly interact with other people, to care about their stories, to be there for them.

That is what I have discovered more and more lately. Being with other people (random people) feels my heart with joy. There is so much in that for me. I enjoy a lot having conversations, and I have discovered that there is a level of curiosity in me that is absolutely bigger than the one that I had before. And before it was also there. So now it is crazy, and I’m opening the door to speak with more and more people in the streets. And it is amazing. I love it. I enjoy it. I enjoy every story, every random thing that they end up saying. Each and every human being has a character that he is playing, and I can realize that more and more I’m developing the capacity for being the witness of that game that is being played by each of them. They are just being, and the less I try to change them, the more I’m able to enjoy them.

And that counts for them and for me. The less I try to change me, the more I’m able to enjoy me for who I am, right here, right now. That is what all the session of today was about. Of embodying more of who she already is. Of using each and every cell of the body as the vehicle that consciousness has chosen to express as ‘you’. With the individuality that comes with it. Of course, at the end, we are all the same and this interface is just an invention of biology so that we can evolve as human beings, but that interface plays a very important role, and it is here that that role is at play. We are being as humans, and it is important to acknowledge that, to ground myself on that, for everyone to ground themselves on that, so that they can connect with the divine from that connection. That is something that is very present in me these days, and having my little girl has been like an anchor to the world. I mean, I still don’t do a perfect job in that regard, but I’m trying my best. I’m doing it the best I can. Sometimes I forget to do something (for example, we were at the park and I said goodbye because I wanted to come and write and I did not give her a big hug an told her where I was going. I know that it is important for me to establish this level of connection, of complicity, so when I was in the bike I was thinking about the fact that I did not told her how much I love her. And that is something that brought learning to me, and that next time that I’m in that situation I will be more minful), but I try to learn from it (as you just noticed) and with that I try to do it better the next time.

That is all what I can do, more than saying that I shouldn’t do it, or whatever, just get the lesson and evolve my relationship with the whole process from there. That is the thing.

I just say the clock and I realized that in many senses this process of coming here to write does look like a meditation. When I sit to do my daily meditation it is like ‘going through it’. It is not something that is absolutely pleasurable, or that brings enormous amounts of joy to my being when I do it. It is more something that needs to be done, it is my duty, and in that sense there are moments of it where I think: Ok, there’s 45 more minutes to go navigating this experience. It is quite challenging and intense, and obviously navigating the fact that if is transforming the relationship that I have with myself is challenging. There is a lot of things that come up, and it is exhausting, in every sense of the word. And coming to write is kind of the same, it means being focused for a long time, it means to be connected with my emotions, with what is going on. Each time that I sit to write is an exploration into what is present, right here and right now, and for that I need to do my best so that I can anchor my presence into the now. And I know that there is a conceptual understanding inside myself that tells me that there is a freeing of energy that is catalyzed with the process of being in presence, that there is more energy available, but right now I feel mostly friction.

And that is the friction that my teacher spoke about in the meditation of today. I came back to work with the guided meditations that he created and in one moment he said that the hindrances and going through them end up generating the friction that light up the fire that burns up the self. With that friction there is an alchemy that happens, and right now, coming here to write at this moment of the day, I’m generating that friction.

And what do I mean by burning up the self? It is about making conscious the aspects that are unconscious. It is the dissolving of samskaras, of all those incomplete life experiences that make me think that I’m something that I’m not. The truth is that I’m not who I’m identified with, but for me, right now, that is just a conceptual understanding. But I know that because of all the friction that I have exposed myself to there is something that is fundamentally changing in my experience of reality, and I know that all that friction, that right now is stored in the area of the forehead, will eventually be released and transcended. And I don’t think it will ever go away completely, at least until now, it is an absolute part of my reality. But who knows how it will look like in the future. The friction is what has created in me the conditions that are bringing to my life the kinds of messages that I have received. The ones in the wedding yesterday, the ones after the breathwork session that I guided in the morning, and also the one that showed up in the conversation that I had in the afternoon with a person that is working a lot in bringing more consciousness into the way on which we relate as human beings. There are doors that are going to be opened, and I’m full on with the exploration of how those doors look like. And more than that, I’m completely into the exploration of what happens at the other side of the door.

I’m clear that I am experiencing a pivotal moment in human history, with everything that has been, that is in place is collasing, and we are here to build the new stories. Which is not built in conspumption but in creativity. It is not built in separation but in integration. This new world is the consequence of everything that the world has seen until now, and in that sense, it is a miracle. What is going on is a miracle. The fact you can read this in a moment absolutely different from the one on which I’m writing it is crazy. And what is even crazier is that I just thought about the process of writing the book in the ideas of the average reader. How does it feel to read these words? Am I able to put myself in the eyes of the reader that is going to read it afterwards? I don’t think so, it hasn’t worked like that until now, and it won’t work now. The way in which I write is normal for me, it is how it flows, and it is the one that I have to keep going. Everything else that I can say or comment is just an idea of the mind, an aspect of complexity that wants to be brought into the conversation. Into what is going to built. But the message that I got in a meditation the previous days is absolutely a new approach of doing this thing. It will be about finding someone or something so that they can know that there is someone behind what is being created and because of that trusting in the creation itself. That whole game of creator being trusted enough is crazy. How can we develop better means for doing this? I think that nothing of what I’m saying makes any sense, but it is good for me to see what happened. Or what happens. I’m sleepy, and I will do my best to not look back. I’ll do my best to not judge me, and use every aspect of my sleepiness as an exploration. As a tool. Just to shout words into the void, and let those words make sense eventually. It doesn’t matter. It truly doesn’t matter if I’m not able to do it in a way that makes sense. What I need is just to express myself, to bring out what is inside there stuck, being rotted, and that’s what this whole writing is about.

That’s why I’m here. To share with you my truth, my absolute and honorable truth, whatever that may feel like today, at this moment, in this place. And I feel closer to that truth, because there are less judgements than before. There is more trust in the process, in the long term of things, and less anxiety related to what this step is about. I’m doing the step, showing up and writing whatever comes up is already Doing The Work, and it is up for the future to make sense of it. If it makes sense or not is is not something that will have an impact in me because it doesn’t matter. I’m here just to experience how it feels to bring all these words out, to set myself free from them, from the burden of having to be in a particular way, of having to fit, of having to push down my beliefs and thoughs and cares because of a particular thing that other people could consider as important. This moment is everything that there is. Right here, right now, and there is no one watching. But they are all watching. You know that I’m here. And you are guiding me, and supporting my journey into myself. All the guides, all the masters, are here with me. Right here, right now. They know all the effort that I have done in the quietness of my own heart, and that amount of challenges is just part of what can be integrated in the future as something that informs you better the story of who you believe that you are. Of the character that you are playing. Eventually, it all comes back to the character that you are playing. How does that character fit in the overarching story of this whole game? Which is it’s role in evoluon?

Those words come from the mind, and they are not something that can be answered with words. They are not something that can be expressed in a particular way, they are just the exploration into what is at the other side of the mind. What remains when the mind is quiet, understood, experienced from a place of non identification. Of non separation. Of integration. Of the bliss that comes from that integration, from understanding that each part of your experience is built over stories. That every word that I say, every act that I go through, is just an expression of the stories that I have been told. The ones that I believe of myself. And that separation, that dissolution has always been there, but it is ok. It is just ok as it is. Holy shit, there is still a huge hill to climb related to this session, and keeps making less and less sense.

Speaking about which, today I was witnessing the people in the streets and realizing how far they seem from living in a state of health. People are fat, full of red things in their face, with their spinal cord like an S, with their neck turned downwards, etc. It is incredible to witness how unhealthy this modern society looks like, how separate from themselves, and from an expression of their being that can be embodied actually in a body that looks good. I don’t have anything against people that are fat, but I know in the depth of my heart that it is a consequence of something that has not been dealth with. And that is something that needs to change in the future. People need to start caring about their body in a different way. They need to start taking care of what they put inside it, from every hole, because that is what determines the quality of the whole experience The human body is a miracle, and as every tool, we need to take good care of it. And that is something that I have tried a lot to do inside this maze of my own mind, and I think that what is going on inside me is a consequence of that.

Right now I’m feeling weird sensations coming from the back of my right eye, and also from the top of the right eyebrow. It feels that this release is still happening, and it comes in waves. It is there and it fades away and then the pressure stays (I mean, it is always here) but there is a big feeling and sensation related to this sensation being the manifestation of something deep that is going to happen. I try my best to not have expectations, but there is like an underlying very basic expectation that I’m going through this process because of what I read in some important books, and right now I’m just exploring what my practice brings. Whatever it may feel like, however it looks. The worrying that I’m not talking enough care of my body, of my self, but I know that I am. As good as I can, with the tools that I have available, right here, right now. It is crazy because in one week I will go a wedding where there will be a lot of doctors. For sure it will be the wedding in my life on which there will be more doctors. And I just realized how powerful that will be as an experience, to just witness them being. All this insanity that I spoke about that I see in people, is something that is present within me towards doctors. A lot of the ones I know have habits that are not healthy at all, but at the end of the day it is what sustains them and the kind of life that they live. Which is brutal. What they have to go through to do everything that they do is something that I’m absolutely grateful for, I’m not criticizing them directly as just a matters of doing it because it feels god, I just want to be in service of building new alternatives. That are aligned with what already is in place, so that the resources are allocated in a good way. I don’t know, the way on which things work right now is crazy. It all seems to be in a place different from the optimal, and right now we are -hopefully- discovering that with more clarity.

Or maybe it is just my bias because I care about those things and I explore that kind of information, but people don’t care about it at all. I mean, it may be, our whole society is built upon eating shit that makes a lot of harm to the body, we are deeply addicted to many different things that regulate in a negative way a big part of the systems of the body, and that’s just on the surface. At the level of the body. What is going on in the underlying layers of the system is even worse. The mental sphere is suffering, with the most amount of people with depression that has existed ever. We live in an era of incredible abundance, yet we are more depressed than ever. And this is because there is something that is put in a place that is not the optimal, so there are a lot of resources that are lost. And the biggest resource of them all which is lost are the beauty of the life of each individual. The beauty of what each of us brings into the world. That is something that this modern society has brought into ourselves, the thought that we are exchangeable. That one person can be changed by the next one, and everything will keep the same. That is never the case. What we bring, what we add, what we are, is the most valuable asset of them all.

And people still don’t realize that. And they don’t realize that eventually we are all part of the same source, we all come from the same place. Or better said, we all arise from the same source. We are all happening as a manifestation of that source, as a game that is played, as a play that is going on in front of our eyes. That is maya, the illusion of time and space, which plays with our understanding of what it means to be a human being. But that is close to change.

We are going through a process of collective birth. I’m sure about that. As I go myself through the process of awakening and I realize how hard it may be to deal with the sensations that are present, or with the changes that it come in the sense of new habits, new ways of being, new forms of communication, or whatever it may be, this birthing of humanity comes with a lot of pain also. We were living in the heavens, with everything that we needed being provided by our mother as we were being developed inside her womb. But now it is time to get out of it, and it is a very challenging process. We’ll go through the birth canal, and a lot of stuff will happen there. It will be painful. There is no way around it. I mean, we could call the card of the cosmic cesarean, but I don’t think it works like that. Humanity will go through the birth canal, it will be tough, but what lies at the other side is the most marvelous thing that we could all dream of. It is just at the other side. And I say that and then I remember the own process of rebirthing that I’m going through, this whole journey of making conscious most of the aspects of my unconscious so that I can free that energy and become available for everything that comes up in my inmediate experience of reality, right here, right now. But yes, it is a tough process, one which will make us face our deepest demons. I tell you because of my own experience. What I’ve delt this year in terms of emotions and stuff that is hard to deal with has been huge, and I have been here just trying to learn the lesson. Trying to understand the best I can what is going on. Whatever that looks like. It is just the wonders of what is. It is just what life is telling us to do, to trust in the process, to trust in what it brings.

And that’s what I’m doing, right here, right now, trusting the process. I’m facing the demons, making peace with them, and moving to another phase of my life walking side by side with them. Sitting back on the cosmic chair and realizing how amazing it is to be able to sit down in the chair on which I’m at with the computer in my lap and witnessing each word that ends up coming. It is like magic, you know. Everything that comes is that, the information that ends up being magic. Because it is incredibly valuable. The magic. The alchemy. The friction that lights up the fire that burns up the self.

And what does it mean for the self to be burned? I don’t know. I just can experience it. And I’m experiencing it right now, I have experience each day since a long time, and I will keep navigating these waters. I like it out here. It feels good. It feels that I’m making progress towards the embodyiment of all the miracles that have happened in my life. I talked previously today about the importance and the work we did with the being you in your body. Of filling every part of your body with life, with the life that comes from the willingness to explore life from the perspective of someone that is eager to live. Eager to explore. Eager to witness. Eager to get to know as much as he can of the person that is at the other side. Whoever that person may be. It doesn’t matter. What truly matters is that it is going to happen, and that person is the consequence of each moment of exploration of life. Of becoming. Of just being.

It is so crazy and ironic and everything to think that I have to go through such a big effort to just be. To take out of myself the parasites, the authorities that are inside my head, which tell me that I should be something different from what I’m here. That tell me all those stoeis about people that were incredible, which I will never reach because I’m too far behind. Al that construct is designed to make our deepest expression not able to shine. How can we shine in a world like this? How can a creative person show the depth of his work?

Holy shit, what a brutal session. I’m very tired, sleepy, and there is a big sensation in me that nothing that I wrote about today makes sense. But you know, at the end of the day, these are the most valuable sessions of them all. Because if there is some value in what I have written today, it means that there is value in the rest of it. And I’m writing that just as a matters of victimizing myself, because I know that there is value in what I write. I know that my ideas are worth spreading. It is just that it is so hard for me to frame them in a way that makes sense. That’s why I’m asking you to do it. That’s why I’m asking you to be able to summarize everything that I have written into something that makes sense for the normal reader. Something that adds value. But then I come back to what I have been repeating. Does it need to add value to other people? Why will I end up doing it?

The image of my father came to mind, and his very special personality. I have been realizing more and more that there is an incredible amount of people that love him, that care about him, and those are aspects of himself that I’m not able to see. I spend so much time criticizing my wife for her not being able to see me, and I’m not even able to see my father. I’m just here being a critic to everthing that comes through his mind, not even realizing the amazing person that is at the other side. He is truly amazing, and it is time for me to embody that so that I can admire him more. I don’t admire him because he never spoke with me deep things, he was always more in the shallow side of the talk. He never participated in discussions, he never was the one that was pushing arguments forward. He just is. And this is all of what the world values. And yesterday I was with the father of my friend that was getting married and he told me that he would never forget something that my father did for him. “Those things are never forgotten”. Those kind of gestures, of lending a hand to those in need, is what characterizes my dad, and I’m truly grateful that life brought that moment for me yesterday on which I was able to listen that from the words of another person. And the way on which he spoke made my day. So it was amazing. And in that amazingness, there is more and more inspiration in me for continuing Doing The Work. To continue to show up. For him. To be able to integrate all of the aspects that make me react, and start building consciously and with responsibility my relationship with him. That is the path that needs to be walked right now, and in that understanding, in the exploration, in that wealth, the future lies.

How would the world look like if you truly stopped critizicing your parents for who they are and started accepting them for everything that they are? How does that world speak about the integration of all of the aspects of ourselves, of our life experience. It is magical to be able to realize this, and to experience it in first person. I’m here, exploring the depths of my existence, and I’m here because of him. I’m here because of everything that they did for me, and the only way on which I can truly embody who I am and everything that I have always been and everything that I will ever be is by embracing them, for who they are. With gratitude for everything that they show to me about myself. With gratitude for each of the life experiences that they’ve had, because I’m a consequence of them. With gratitude for all of their being. With gratitude for them just being.

That’s the end message that I want to leave here. The importance of caring about the parents. Of truly embodying what it means to not criticize them, and just love them for who they are. Yesterday, today, and in every day. It is the biggest act of humility, to stay quiet and just allow them to be. Just let them be. It is their turn. You can just sit back and enjoy the show, the show of them playing the character that they were dealt.

Becoming free of the willingness to change them.

Just let them be.
