After a big delay in the way on which I have been doing things today, here I come, to explore what is right now. I have just read the pre release draft of an institution that is being created by people that seem to have the same intentions that I have, of bringing healing into the world, and there are a lot of feelings that are present in me.

First, there is a perceived aspect of disconnection between what they are manifesting in the world, the way on which the message is conveyed, and the ‘normal people’ of the world. It is similar to what happens to me, but in this case it seems to be exacerbated because of the message that they are throwing out. It is very directed to a particular kind of human being, which is connected to this whole awakening path, of better understanding the self, but that language brings separation of itself, because it is impossible for people that are not in the path to understand it. And how can it be translated to normal people? That is what is most needed right now. Not spiritual people connecting with each other to enhance their spirituality, but spiritual people connecting with each other with the purpose of better realize which are the means by which they can connect to the outer world, to the day to day life, so that a transformation can start to take place in the individuals that are part of it. How can life be transformed for the random worker that goes back in the metro, tired of life, but that has to show up again tomorrow to do his thing?

This is the main question that revolves my being right now, because I can live my whole life doing internal work with people that love doing it, but when is the time on which I face the hard moment of realizing that the whole world is in a different place than this one? This is the truth. There is a big disconnection with where I am at and with the whole world, and the whole thing that I’m doing here is finding out how to gap this disconnection so that more consciousness can be brought up for people that are not necessarily connected to this whole movement. And that is the big mission, and that is why for me, social media is a huge way through this whole thing. I always say, the only way in is through, and by opening the door for people to connect with their creativity there is a window into what can be. Most people don’t connect to it because of fear of it being done wrong, and that is the main aspect by which they don’t connect deeper to themselves.
Creativity is a window into the connection with the Self. And it has been closed for most of us, for fear of it being done wrong. Always building up from polarities. And that is the window that I want to help open in people. Not the one of building retreats for the eternal seekers. Of course there will be important moments and soul bondings in these, I don’t doubt it, but what is needed is to bring this into the daily life of normal humans, so that a shift in the way on which we relate to each other can be produced. And it is very important to think about which is going to be the entry point for this work in my life. How am I going to progress so that I can get to the people that will have this impact. Who are the entry points in society that can be the starters of this new movement? I always come back to the ones that are depressed. That sole world for me has a lot of information, because it speaks about an existential gap into separation. In the document they spoke about awakened individuals, but what happens with those that are at the complete opposite of that? That want life to truly end for them?

These people are the entry point. The ones that have had spiritual experiences and are avid for more are living in a dream, one which is apart from the suffering that normal human beings are going through. Art is the way. That is the message that comes more and more. Art is the means by which consciousness realizes itself, because in the pure creative act there are no means for things to be different from what they are. And a lot of artists have had an episode of depression, and that means a lot. Because art has been the means by which they have been able to go out of it. To transcend it by creating from the heart.

These transformational journeys that I am imagining are the means by which depressed people tap into their creative aspect. And through that, they move towards enlightenment, by the sole pursuit of their craft. There is a big connection because the way on which artists relate to the world, and the practice of spirituality. I have found that this connection is very deep, and by just observing how they behave, I can see that there is a lot into who we are through what they do. I tend to put them on a pedestal, and it is because a lot of the most integral people that I have met are artists. They know their shit. They are Doing The Work. They are inclined to do it, because it is necessary on their path of self discovery. Through this, they become better at their craft. The same as me, coming here to write down these words, going closer to my true self by just letting flow whatever comes. That is the exploration that I want to help bring about. What is present when the boundaries of the ego are dissolved, and you allow yourself to create just for the sake of it.

The creative act just for the sake of the creative act.

That is something that it has been truly hard for me to embody, because there is always this aspect of economic well-being that is missing in me. My relationship with money always steps in the way, and I’m not able to transcend it. A lot of energy is stuck in there, and writing these words is my way of finding my way out of it.

Artists are the ones that are in charge of making this transition of humanity into an awakened species. They are the ones that know better. And it is time for them to shine.

One of the things that came up to me recently is that the mission of what I’m building is for every person in the world to create an NFT. We all will have our own, and the creative act will be the means by which this will happen. Each person giving herself the opportunity to be creative, just for the sake of it.

But what if I’m bringing myself into a rabbit hole that is not necessary right here? I don’t know. There is really little understanding inside myself related to how to make progress. Everything seems to be moving so fast on the outside, and I’m still not able to make my way through this maze so that I can clarify what I bring into the world. I even don’t know where to start. Which is the next step. Definitely what I made yesterday was a big step forward, sending that email that helped me clarify that what I want to do is to help each person create a digital presence, a digital real estate, that can help her build what she needs to start sharing who she is. And I already have the most important person in the world to work with, who is my wife. I can do this whole process with my heart with her, and share what I learn. With this, we are going to be able to build an amazing thing for her, and I will be able to gather up the knowledge that I need to help other people. We all can be superstars now, and each of us has the information available to do it. Maybe my mission is to point people towards that information. Be able to curate it, so that together we can join forces and thrive.

That is the mission that resonates right now, the one of helping people to be more of who they are, by creating.

I feel stuck, really stuck. But there is people that are giving me strong feedback, messages, about things being done in a good way. The thing is that I’m not able to earn money with where I am at, I’m just here. Stuck.

I guess that a good starting point is asking: What is the change that I want to make? But the problem with that question is that what comes to mind is everything. In my eyes, everything is in a weird place, in a place different from the optimal. And that makes me waste my time focusing on the big picture, and not in the step that is just in front. What is the next step? What is the smallest next step that I can take to bring about more of who I am into the world?

And there comes back the idea of mindful social media. Of doing it with intention, with purpose. But are people going to digest that? Or is it me talking in Chinese more and more?

That’s it. That is the message that I have seen from all of these social media accounts that share stuff about the exploration of the self, non duality, and such. There seems to be a complexity within what they talk about that makes the message very resistant to the masses. That is why Dan Koe has been so effective with what he does, because he brings about spirituality, but not in a literal way. It is embedded into what he does, but hidden between the layers. And that is the way to go. Realizing that people are not ready for it. They are hesitant. And that is why I keep revolving around the notion of creativity, because that is how I think I can reach more people. By opening them to the window of what comes when they are creative. For them to be constructive with their being. And build something that did not exist before. And the barrier of entry must be low, very low, so that it can happen.

How it can happen?

Is Dukkha even a good idea? Will people jump into a thing without the knowledge of what it is? Even if the creator doesn’t have any clue about what it is?

That is the thing. It is very important for me to understand the game that I have been playing, so that I can better get a grasp of where I am at right now. I have been learning how to grow a Twitter audience, so that I can reach more people with my message.

But what if my message will reach them through other people? The only way in is through. What if the way on which I reach other people is through those that have already established their audience? Maybe this is the way. This is the means by which this thing happens. Helping the creators that have already established their audience to build up the means to better connect with that audience, so that there can be a communication that can enhance life overall.

Each creator has an audience that follows them because of something. What is that I can create that can be the means by which this audience is leveraged in a concrete way so that something can happen from this interaction?

Let’s think about Noxx, and amazing 3D artist with which I have interacted on Twitter. He has 13k followers, a lot of which are other artists that are very inspired by his work. He interacts a lot with his audience, and that is very powerful. He has a big following. He wants to make a living out of this thing. He just wants to create. That reminds me of myself. I just want to create. I just want to build up geometric worlds with which people can delight themselves. There is an aspect of me that just wants to come to the computer, draw stuff, and have fun. And I’m not letting that aspect express itself because of all the noise trying to fit. Trying to build something that is already happening. The ecosystem is already moving. It is already going on. I have not been able to realize it yet, but it is already moving on, towards the infinite. Worlds of creations, worlds of expression, that are being built through the internet by people that are already where I want to be. But I am where I am at. It has always been perfect like this.

What if I just create what wants to be created, and move on from there? What if this system comes into being through me, I built it robustely, and help myself become free? Artists are the ones that carry out the future. What about doing generative art with code and geometry? Maybe that is the thing. Perpetual motion into the exploration of the present moment, from a circle into the infinite.

I haven’t created art in a while. And maybe that is the thing. Holy shit, this is more noise coming in. What a crazy session this is, with all this noise, with all this willingness to express something and that is not being too helpful in that. I mean, yes, there is expression, but what is it about?

That is the thing, I’m just losing it here. And it is a good question to ask, what has brought me here today?

See the big picture. Open your eyes, and enable yourself to see the big picture. I probably feel the way I do because of the disappointment that it has brought to me to have my teacher fail. I don’t want to feel this way. Why should I expose myself to that? I don’t deserve it. I have given my best, and it is important for me to take action and care about myself enough so that I don’t let this happen freely. It is not something good. I need to take action. I need to make some progress in the direction of freedom. And I now is when I come back to what Dukkha is about. Stay on track, my friend. It is time for that.

So the main intention behind this project is to build a response to the eternal quest for transformational festivals and meditation retreats. How can life become that? Or do we really need these kinds of interactions to exist in an harmonic way? I truly don’t think so, and I’m looking for the understanding of how to build this. How to drop this snowball from the mountain so that it can be something powerful, strong, and consistent in time. It is crazy to think about what Satoshi Nakamoto started with bitcoin. He threw that snowball, and it has been growing and growing through the world. And making its impact. What is what I’m trying to create here?

The means for each person to be an artist, and that is my journey. From being an engineer to an artist. I truly want to be an artist, and be able to express all of who I am in a craft that can delight the eyes of those who want to be the witness. Merge everything that I am into amazing creations. But even writing this is still in the line of what I have always strived for and brings suffering, which is the identification with something specific. Why do I need to fall into categories? Why should I define myself as an artist? Is it even necessary? In 21 days of 4 hours of deep work, I can end up having 84 hours of doing the craft. Is that what I want to do? And how do I want to do it? With a different software every time, so that I can be always learning something new. I’m just writing stuff that is not connected one with each other, all of what I have written today is noise. And it is perfect like that, because that noise is what is present inside me. There is a lot of noise. A lot of uncertainty. A lot of willingness to do stuff, but a lack of understanding of how to do it. What is the next step forward. I feel dizzy, I feel nervous. There is a lot of anxiety present. But let’s go back to Dukkha, and see what comes up.

So what I think about this project is setting up the ground for the transformational journeys, which will take the people that will be part of them into a way of existing that is at the intersection of a meditation retreat and a transformational festival. It is about approaching life from the perspective of a human being that brings out the most of it.

Thoughts of David Foster Wallace come up. The amazing books that he wrote, and the depth of all of them. And all of that was because of his depression. Was it a necessary stepping stone into the evolution of humanity? Did he need what I’m trying to build to be able to create what he created? Nope, he didn’t. But it was probably because he was able to create systems for himself for going through the resistance. What happens for normal people that have trouble going through those initial steps of resistance?

How can I reach out to depressed people so that I can better understand what they are going through, and if this is going to help them in any way? Am I the one that will help them? Is that even possible? Maybe I am depressed myself and I don’t know how to help me. I don’t want to help them. I want to help us. I want to build a system for all of us to help each other. Maybe that is what the whole NFT ecosystem has brought to the world, the means by which artists from all over the world are able to help each other, and build community. Before this wave, for them to sell their work was much harder, obscure. NFT’s gives them a window, an opportunity, and that is very valuable. It is truly changing the world, by opening it to those that want to dive into their creative self. Am I one of those? Yes, I am. For sure. But what is that that I am creating? I don’t even know.

The world is open, and each avenue is a new opportunity for creating. There is less clarity than ever before, and it is getting more and more confusing. How am I sharing myself with the world? How is my message reaching out? That is something that I need to better realize, so that I can more on with that understanding. With that knowing.

I’m on the journey of creating my first NFT. My first digital asset. I haven’t done it yet, and I really want to know so that I can have more stuff published out there that people can interact with. Which is the best software for drawing geometry? Is this even the right question?

Holy shit, the world is fucking confusing. For sure it was much easier to be the son of a shoemaker and just continue with what he had done always. For sure it is easy to go to university and just continue with the path that life shows you in front. Realizing what to do is just too hard. And much more because it requires a level of commitment that I have not been able to achieve. With anything. Well, I think I’m getting there with my family, and probably that is the most important one. But in the other aspects, I have not been able, and it is tough! I just go from one point to the other one. Picking here, picking there, like a hummingbird. When will this stop?

I thought Dukkha was the answer, but there are doubts present right now even related to that.

It doesn’t matter. It is perfect as it is. I showed up, I did the work, and that is all that matters. It will work out for itself.
