Perseverance and consistency are some of the biggest wonders of what being a human is. Today in my meditation I had sensations going on in my system that were completely new, and which brought to me the gratitude related to how much I have stayed committed to my own evolution. How much I have showed up. I have been for a long time, almost on my own, putting in the hours that are required to realize how to deepen my meditation practice, how to know myself better so that I can dissolve those unconscious patterns into a more conscious and responsible way of being. I have been exploring that all this time (putting all the effort for around 2 years I would say), and today is a day on which I can say that it is worth it. It is not that it is necessary to feel this new sensations to be able to say something like that, but when you have been for such a long time without a direct feedback from the world related to what you are doing (because what you are doing doesn’t have a way of being compared more than what it means to show up, it is hard to measure or evaluate the progress in meditation, at least for me), it gets very exhausting. Just yesterday I wrote that I was thinking that I was not going to be able to maintain my meditation practice for much more time if I kept doing it on my own, and today I had these new sensations that are a reminder of: Hey, you are not alone. Your whole being is listening, you are connecting with a higher aspect of yourself that you are not even able to understand yet, so just keep being patient, keep showing up, keep trusting. Melt into that trust. Let it be what manifest through your actions. That is all what you need.

So yes, I’m here after an incredible meditation session which brought a lot to me. As if the tension that I have been feeling in the forehead had been dissolved in a percentage, and that dissolution transformed into the experience of sensations of energy throughout the body. I don’t really know how to describe the sensations, even if now as I write this I’m feeling it. It is something like the chills of when you are a bit cold, and there is something like a movement, something like an opening, and a willingness to be more aware of the breath. That is always there, as a reminder… Remember you are breathing, and use this moment as an invitation to breathe a bit slower. Become more aware of how your body is moving and reacting and doing everything it is doing, so that you can go deeper into the experience of the present moment through that. Every sensation that you have going through your system, remember: I return to my natural equilibrium with my compassionate attention. I allow myself to feel how it feels. To experience what this present moment brings, so that I can embody it completely with that frame of being. And that is just what I’m exploring here. Experimenting on how it feels to live with consciousness anchored in the present moment. Absolutely and completely embody how it feels to be me. Not wanting to change any aspect of my experience, just accepting it, with equanimity, with patience, and with compassion. I’m here to witness my own evolution, and that is something that can be easily forgot.

For example, right now I came to a place for the wedding of a good friend of school, and there are many, many friends which I haven’t seen for a while. It is tempting for me to feel that I’m behind, that they have achieved a lot mor in their life, and that because of that, they are in a better position. It is very hard for me to witness my process of evolution and say: Yes, that is the path that I have taken. I embrace it, and I embody each part of it in every conversation that I have. So that I can learn the most from the other person. So that I can grow from each interaction. Without the expectation of my experience to change, or to be in a different place. Just with the acceptance of the place where I am at, just embracing it and embodying it fully. What I’m doing with my life is equally valid than what other people are doing, and it is time that I can give a lot of energy to it so that I can trust the place where I am at. I mean, of course I trust it, it is what I have been doing for a long time now, but it is hard when it is in relationship with other people that were on the same place that I was. That is the moment on which the doubts and comparisons and all that stuff comes. And I know that it is there, but I also know that the only way in is through. By having these conversations, by engaging in getting to know those people, of realizing that we are all just trying to do our best, given our circumstances, and it is ok like that. It is very important for me to become free from the burden of questioning my experience. It is just what it is, and I’m here to love that and embrace it and live from there.

So yes, that is what is present in me right now. The importance of committing to Do The Work, and the trust in the outcome of that process. I have done it, I have trusted, and here I am, just navigating what is present as the bridge is being walked. And this is the bridge of life, you know. It is not that I will arrive to the other side and the walk will cease to happen. Nope. I mean, when I write this there is a big expectation in me that there actually is a bridge. On one side, it is the realization of the individual. It is the embodiment of my true nature, and the experience of it from my perspective of awareness. It is what is at the other side of awareness becoming aware of itself. So the frame of existence that I have right now is that there is a place where I’m walking towards, and that place is called abiding non dual awareness. That’s what I work for. That is the place where I’m headed. But what happens if I ‘reach’ there? What comes at the other side? (Maybe I’m just talking nonsense and it is not a place where you arrive, I haven’t experienced it so my understanding is completely rational. I haven’t even studied it too much, so I’m just talking from my gut here). So yes, let’s suppose that I arrive to the other side: What happens there?

And the answer that comes is the necessity for showing others the way. Of sharing with them what has brought me to that side of the bridge. So in many ways it feels like coming back and resonating with what is going on at this side so that I can resonate in that frequency and then elevate it to the other one. That’s why I say that the awakening of humanity will be an exponential process, because more and more people will wake up in presence of others. And when that happen, it will be like a snowball that will have us just manifesting our truth, and interacting with life from there. How in the world wouldn’t you want to be free? No matter how hard it could be to get there, eventually we’ll walk next to each other. We’ll help each other. And that is the mission that we have, that is the place where we are headed to, and I’m very excited about what the meditation brought to me today because it feels like an opening. Energetically, emotionally, mentally and physically. Something big is happening inside me, and it feels like everything is happening in a way that I can’t even comprehend. But here I am, prepared for it. Prepared for anything that comes. Giving my best to what comes. Exploring it, embracing it, loving it, and just being more and more of myself in the process. So yes, here I am, again, just being myself. Into a new exploration of how it feels to embody my truth.

And a big part of that truth is related to shining a light into the capacities and genius of others. Yesterday I was coming here in the car and talking to a good friend and I ended up inviting him to start using the internet creating content, so that he could balance the consumption and creation and with that be able to express a bit more of what he came here to share. That ratio is one of the biggest diseases in our society, because the relationship of consumption against creation of content is very biased towards consumption. At the end, it is the easy path. The hard one is to come up with something new, with novel ideas, and be willing to expose yourself to the world by sharing them openly. What that brings into us may be the fear of reject, of not being enough, etc, and the acceptance and understanding of those things that are brough is what creates the necessity for something new. Do people truly want to live in this state of overconsumption that drains life away from your being? I don’t think so. What I think is that they just don’t know better, and that is why I’m here with my toolkit and everything that I am trying to push a new way of doing things. That’s why I call myself a creativity unleasher, because it will be my job to bring people into the experience of how it feels to show up and create. How it feels to be consistent and eventually have results. It is amazing. It is time to do more of that. So that people can share their uniqueness in a new way in the world.

I mean, just by being they are expressing their uniqueness, and it is very interesting that each of us has a unique set of genetics, of experiences (epigenetics), of life stories, of everything, which comes to play as the door for exploration is opened in the life of that individual. It is a process, everything is a process, and in that sense the most important part is just to trust it. Just to trust and enjoy it as much as possibe, because it is what will end up bringing the wonders of the future. The magic of life. The experience of what it means to just be. I’m again running around in circles with all these platitudes, and it is partly because I’m sleepy and I want to go to bed and hug my wife and just enjoy sleeping a little bit more and the warmth of her body and the touch of her skin against mine and her breathing and all what it means to have another human being that will enjoy as much as she will enjoy my tenderness and willingness to spend a nice time together. There is discomfort in me related to the place where I’m writing also, I’m stuck in this hotel room which is very small and doesn’t even have a bathroom inside. The door makes a lot of noise, so I can’t open it because it will wake them up. And I don’t want to wake them up. So here I am, stuck in the room, giving my best in this session. Bringing the power of those patrones, and the motivation for coming up with mine. Mathematics is a very important part of my life, and another one of the windows that I have to open that I have stopped putting enough energy to. I mean, at one point you have to make chocices, and here I am, making my choices of writing what is being written. And not going to bed now again. Just allowing myself the next 5 minutes to show up a bit more, and then it will be time for me to rest.

What comes to mind is my brother, and the ceremony he is doing today with the old and ever present technology of Ayahuasca. He is going into it, with it, through it, once more, and in this writing I want to acknowledge that journey and express my willingness to be there. Just to be. Just to explore what comes, with all flavors, with all experiences. Every one is valid, the important part of it is to show up. It is to be there, in the trenches, navigating whatever the experience brings. Using it as the means for going deeper into the understanding of your position in the universe, for the place where you are at. Eventually, as the means of becoming more and more of yourself, as you lift the fog of everything that you are not. Every medicine of this kind points you towards the state of living life in the present moment, and that is where all pieces of wisdom come from. No matter who is the person. I’m not absolutely sure about this, that is no a conceptual understanding of this by myself, but I truly believe it. You think with your mind, you believe with your heart. I’m believing with my heart that everything is headed towards the present moment, to the dissolution of time, to the exploration of what coms when I don’t worry about the outcome of whatever I’m doing. And what is the outcome of this session of writing? What is the outcome of the ceremony on which my brother will embark? The dissolution into trust. The acceptance of everything that it brings. That is the path that lies ahead of me also, that acceptance in every moment, with every person, in all situations. I just needs to stay committed and perseverant to me. It will be incredible. Amazing. It is time to experience how it feels to feel. Everything that comes. With an open heart, and willingness to fill up the void with everything that you came here to be.

Discovering another person is the act of being curious to what is already there. Instead of finding the ideal person, give yourself the opportunity to explore what is already there, and become marveled by what ends up being shown by her. Each human being is a gem, and the exploration of life along another one is the pursuit of bringing about more and more of that gem so that it can shine through each one of the actions that you embark upon. And the same plays for other kinds of relationships, especially the one with yourself. What if instead of searching your passion you create it by actually showing up to experience what is already there? What if all of life is actually a journey of understanding what already is, instead of looking for something else? And in this exploration of what already is, allow yourself to end up recognizing those aspects of yourself that you don’t accept completely, and just be with them. They are there, but they are not who you are. What you are is beyond that. It is way more than that. And it is time for you to start taking away what is not, by allowing more and more that presence with what already is. The kind, compassionate present with what is there. It may be hard, of course. Most of us don’t like enough the image that they see at the mirror. And that is something that is very hard for me to understand clearly, because the perception that I have of myself has been worked through a lot of these things. I have travelled the path of learning how to love myself enough to feel that I’m in a different place related to this than most of the people, and because of that, it is hard for me to realize where other people are. That’s why it is going to be important and interesting and all the above to create the podcast on which I will be able to connect with random people from all over the world, because this will be a window into the life of them. Into what worries them. Into what is present when they feel how they feel. And what if the people that I interview are young ones, the type of people that don’t know what to do with their life, the ones that are depressed? What if I openly and directly talked to depressed people and I tried to help them directly? That is the thing, the feeling of not being alone. When you realize that you are not alone, at least part of that depression is transformed into an acceptance of it. A resonance between you and your environment that enables something different to happen. An opening. And those are the persons that need more help, and giving them a window where they can talk openly about their problems will end up having a huge impact in their life. And what I can get to know other people with this is huge. As I think about the target people of the thing that I’m going to create those that are still in high school come to mind. Those that have to decide what to do with their life. Those that don’t have the inertia of having to pay for the tuition for a university. Those that are not yet in the rat race. Working with people that are already in the rat race is hard, but doing it with those that are not is different. Is something that hasn’t been explored until now, and it feels like an amazing thing to do now. Open those wounds, so that they can afterwards show that to their parents and let them know: This is me. This is my truth. When does that conversation happen? When is it available for other people? I don’t think it is enough. And I think it should be had more. What is coming now is the understanding of how it could be had more. And yes, this connects with the thing that I have been talking about of the awakening of humanity as a exponential process. What if those that will wake up first are the ones that are more depressed? What if the ones that will show us the way are the ones that seem more lost? I think there is a lot of wealth in that. There is a path forward. Which is the relationship between enlightenment and depression? Are they two sides of the same coin? I don’t even have a slight understanding of this, but I think it is a question worth exploring. It is something that is worth navigating. And the fact that the young people have less programming and wiring in place, seems like a promising avenue for the rewiring to happen with more ease. If I’m 30 years old and I start meditating as I do now, there is a possibility that my whole nervous system is way more fixed and stuck in the old patters. But if I had started when I was 18, it feels that it could have been much easier. Faster. There is less to deal with. I mean, the whole emotional and mental structure of how we were developed in the world is still there because it is stuck in the first 14 years of life, but the way on which those are expressed in the world have been repeating for less time. It seems promising. It seems like an interesting pathway towards the future. To help those that are young and depressed, for them to wake up to their true nature, so that they can be the builders of the new world. It doesn’t make any sense to teach my mother how to use NFTs. What makes sense is to teach this new technologies to the young generations, which are more plastic, so that they can teach their parents about it.

The young ones are who are going to build the new world. They are the ones that are working with the creation of what is not here yet, and it is my mission to bring this light that I want to shine towards them. Working with the generation of my parents is too much friction. It is too much of trying to make them understand. But on the other hand, that is where the money is. But what if I offered the generation of my parents the tools for getting their children out of the state of depression on which they are at now? What if I was able to develop a system that helped them overcome depression by channeling their creative expression into something new that did not exist before and I sold this to their parents? Which would be the consequence of something like this?

I like the way on which I’m talking here, because I’m putting myself on the position of selling something. That is something that is always hard for me to do, as if everything that I did should be free. As if I couldn’t charge for any of it. And that is something that is always in me, this eternal difficulty for asking for money against the stuff that I do. I want to learn how to deal with this issue in my life, so that I can live a good life, acknowledging the need for relating to it with money. Acknowledging what I bring into the world, the impact of it, and being able to charge people for that accordingly. It has been so tough for me. So that’s why I need to work on that, and learn how to relate to money in a new way. It is one of the most important topics of what I will deal with in the coming year, and it is time for me to realize that and open the door for that to happen. Open the door for the healing to come. From within. I’m here to heal from within, each aspect of myself.

And for that, I need to support that healing process with ways of interacting with my body that can feel good. For example now I’m at a hotel and it is Saturday so it is my cheat day and I ate white bread with jam and stuff that I’m not used to eat and now I feel inside as if they were twisting my intestines in a way that doesn’t feel comfortable. There is a big sense of discomfort inside me right now, and it is directly related to what I just ate. I know that I told myself that I would give me this cheat day, but it is really necessary? Is it what I need, what my body needs? I don’t think so. It doesn’t feel like that. It is more of my mind telling me that it is moment to eat sweets so I allow myself to do it, but I don’t feel like a craving to do it. The inclination that I have always felt for them is less and less present, and that is something that surprises me because it seemed that it would never change. I love eating sweets too much to give them up. That’s what I used to tell me. And each time that I have said that it is the last time that I would eat them felt that it was truly the last time but it was never the last time. But now it feels different. What happened today in the morning meditation requires me to stay with this warrior ethos every day. It doesn’t make sense for Saturday to come and me forgetting everything that I had done in the week so that I can eat whatever comes up on a day like this. It doesn’t feel good actually. I feel kind of sick with it, and I remember that the last week was the same. The cheesecake that I ate did not bring as much pleasure to me as I was expecting, so then came the disappointment. And here, with what I just wrote, there is important information about myself. I was expecting to like it. I’m perpetuating those behaviors because there is in me an expectation related to me going to like them. It is in me the fact that ‘I like sweets’, so each time that I eat them there is a predisposition in me to like them. To enjoy them because I have always liked them. But what if I truly connect with what is present in my body in that moment, and realize that the pleasure that they bring is not as big as it used to be? And this relates to everything that I do, you know? What if in every situation of my life I relate to it with what it is actually bringing, instead of what I expect it to bring to me?

For example, now there is a soccer world cup being played. I have told myself the story the last years that I don’t like soccer anymore, and that’s why I have been apart of it. But with the world cup I have felt emotions that I haven’t felt in quite a while, so this is another reminder of the same thing that I’m talking about here. What if I truly connect with what is present, instead of the expectation that I have of how it should be? What it should bring into my life?

That is why it is so important to live in the present moment. For example, today I will see a lot of people that have been a big part of my life. People from high school, that I have interacted for long times, as I was growing, as I was being transformed. They are part of the way on which I developed as a human being. They are a huge part of my life. And I haven’t seen them in quite a while. How can I really know what being with them will bring into me? How does it help to build a mental image about this?

This is one of the biggest aspects of learning how to live in the present. Avoid all that allocation of resources and let all the resources of my being be used in the building of the present with which I interface with reality, right here, right now.
