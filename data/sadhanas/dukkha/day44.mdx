There are feelings of anger showing up in myself as I listen to my baby cry. I wonder where do they come from. Probably they are related to the necessity of being in control, of wanting to do things my way, and having them happen as I expect them to be. And that is one of the biggest challenges of having a child: Entering into the frequency of the new human being that is part of your life. It is about being open to what that person needs, and be able to give up what you have in your hands so that you can provide her with what she needs. And I have not been able to do that properly, and it is quite frustrating sometimes. But the interesting part of it is that moment when you give up your preferences and open up to give her what she wants, and exploring the world from there. For example, today she kept crying in the morning and I only wanted her to go back to sleep so that I could do my stuff. But my partner came and told me that she woulnd’t sleep anymore, because we were not sleeping. She knew that. And she showed her around, the birds outside, and everything, and she stopped crying. And then I grabbed her, and did the same, and brought her outside and walked listening to the birds, and it was quite magical. It was not what I intended to do, there were more ‘important’ things to do, but eventually I realized that this was more important than anything else. And this is the thing that comes with opening up to the world of the young ones. Entering their frequency and giving up that extreme willingness that I have of controlling and just giving them what they need. It is hard for me because I don’t completely understand what her needs are, but today was a step towards that direction.

And maybe that is what freedom is about. Realizing that I wont be able to do everything that I would want, anytime, and that giving up the control feels good. I have been trying to control a lot my stuff lately, and perhaps that is why I’m so deep into this maze of Dukkha. I want to control the way on which I wake up. I really want to wake up. And that is part of what is driving me crazy. But at the same time, there is a deep aspect of what I’m doing that is being helpful, because I’m actually realizing more and more the ways on which I’m doing stuff in a way that generates noise inside. That is not resonant with my own truth. I want to walk towards truth, and the only way on which I will be able to do that is by giving myself the possibility of acting from a place of truth. Which is my truth in this moment? Which is your truth? That is what needs to be acknowledged, and accepted. There are no right or wrongs. There are only things that are happening. There are only feelings and sensations that are present, and those are my truth in this particular moment. Maybe in the future that resistance that is built because of the crying of my little girl will not produce anger, or maybe it will, but the important part is to accept it and move on with it. It doesn’t really matter which kind of sensation or emotion is present, the only thing that matters is that is fully felt. Bliss is any emotion fully felt.

I interrupted the writing so that I could message a friend which’s mother is at the hospital, almost dying. There is a lot of talk related to the people that are around those who are in these circumstances, the family that is suffering because of the person that is sick, and what they go through. But I want to take some time and acknowledge those who are suffering. Who are in the hospital, witnessing their life end and not knowing what will happen afterwards. They are at mercy of what the doctors decide for them, and of what can happen with their body because of their circumstances, and the amount of uncertainty is brutal. What they go through is huge, and I think that it is important to acknowledge this. To be there for them. What if we were more present for those who are dying? I want to develop a stronger capacity for this. Holy shit, there are so many things that I want to do. It is crazy, and I can’t even wrap my mind around a few of them. It is very challenging to have the world absolutely open and not realize which are the next steps to take. But again, I’m talking about the next steps as I’m taking these ones. As I write this book, which is the mission that I have at hand, I’m already thinking about what will happen in the next iteration. What if I brought my entire consciousness to this moment? What if I was able to give this action the entirety of who I am, so that I could perform it the best that I could? But isn’t it that I’m doing that just by writing here? The fact that I’m writing about something that will happen in the future is just part of who I am in this moment, and it doesn’t do me any good to deny this. It is just part of who I am right now. I am this uncertainty. I am this lack of clarity. I am this willingness to do everything, everywhere, at the same time. It is just part of who I am, and in the moment that I write about it, I acknowledge it, and I walk a step towards embracing this aspect of myself. Different it would be that I did not do anything, that I didn’t come here with the intention of bringing out whatever is present. But I’m doing it, and I’m leaving this as a manifesto of who I am in this moment of the history of humanity.

This is how consciousness is manifested through me, and it is perfect like this. By being present with what is present, I’m moving towards loving myself. By doing that, I’m opening the door to love each person that is around me. And that is what I want to bring into the world. Clarity and the capacity of being with what is.

It is easy to say that when I’m in the most comfortable place in the world, in the car with my wife, daughter and parents going on a small vacation to Argentina to spend the birthday of my wife. It is easy to bring all this stuff up because there is no one challenging what I say. There is probably no one that will read this, so it is very easy to bring it up. I’m not exposing myself. Is that true? I’m exposing myself to myself, and that is perhaps the strongest way on which I could move towards a better understanding of which my biases are. I’m not showing off so that someone can think better of me, I’m just bringing up whatever comes up, establishing as my truth right now, and moving on with it. As I write, I make the unconscious conscious, and that is all of what I need to make some progress in this game on which progress is a mirage. I am already complete, the only thing is that I don’t realize it yet. It is part of the game to not have realized it.

Sometimes I underestimate what I have done, what I’m going through. And the fact that I write sometimes is already a lie in itself, because it is always. I always underestimate it. I don’t realize that the purpose of what I’m doing is becoming free from all the bondages that attach me to a particular way of being, to the identification with myself, with the character that I have been playing all this time. I’m doing the most important work of my lifetime here, and it is time for me to acknowledge that. To be proud of it. It is hard to be in the car with my parents and be the witness of everything that shows up inside my being as I’m being triggered by what they say, by who they are. By the stuff that is inside me that is a consequence of who they are. They are the ones that made me who I am, and being in this car with them is the biggest piece of information that I could get related to who I am. The more I bring this into myself as a reality, and the more I embrace it, and accept it, and love it, the freer I will be. This is the biggest gift that life has given me. Nothing else, and nothing more. It is not the material wealth that enables me to be writing this book, it is the opportunity of being in this car with them. Knowing better who I am by being the witness of who they are. And being with my little daughter here at the same time. It is pure gold. It is a gift. And this is the moment on which I embrace it. On which I express my gratitude towards life, for the gift of being able to spend this much time with my parents. I don’t think there is a person of my age that has spent this much time with this parents, and it doesn’t even matter because that is a comparison and comparisons don’t help if they are not with yourself only. It doesn’t truly matter if there is another person that has done what I have done, the only important thing is that I have done it. And here I am, on the battleground again, moving a step closer towards a deeper loving of them. Of being present for them. Of bringing everything that I am into this moment so that I can share my truth with them. I’m writing and my father is driving, and the truth of who I am right now is that I’m this person that is writing in the computer listening to music as they are watching the road go by. Is this my role in this whole circumstance? Is this what I want to bring into the world? Yes, at least for a while. It is very important for me to Do The Work, and only here I’m able to do it because this is the place where I am at right now. As I write, I move towards a greater and greater state of presence, and this is the presence that I’m sharing with them. The truth of who I am, right here, right now. I am the one that is writing all these words like a stream of consciousness, and I am the one that afterwards will be as present as he can be with them. With my wife, with my daughter. It is an amazing opportunity to be on this car, and I embrace it with all of what I am.

What if all the people of my age decided to spend their parents heritage in life for one year? What if all my classmates decided to take a sabbatical and give them just their attention right now, when they are good and healthy? We don’t do that enough because we think that our life is more important than what we can do with them.

And I took out the headphones to share with them this new understanding that came up as I was writing and I encountered the same old stuff as always, and it is perfect as it is. I will keep all this things to myself, because the important action that I can undertake is not sharing with them rationally what I have learned, but actually changing my relationship with them because of that. Actions speak much louder than words. The best way to approach every insight that is brought into your life because of what you go through is by asking: How is this going to help me be more present in everything I do? All healing is a step towards becoming more and more present, since that is the ultimate goal. Becoming free means anchoring your consciousness in the present moment, and experiencing everything that life brings to your awareness from there. It doesn’t matter how it is resolved, it only matters how you develop the capacity for being more present.

You did forgive your parents for what they did (or didn’t) do to you? Sounds nice, so how are you going to act the next time that you are with them? It is easy to ‘heal’ when you are isolated in your own sphere, but the true work comes from being there, with them, facing the triggers that are brought up.

The kind of issues and problems that are brought up in each of our lifes is very different, and it is important to have that in mind. I can’t compare my life to one of a refugee, or the one of a person that goes to war, simply because it is an absolutely different circumstance. It is not what I came here to do to go to war. The kind of wars that I’m fighting are inside myself, with the way on which I relate to myself and my environment, and it is also important to acknowledge that so that I can become free of the ‘wanting to have a hard life’ way of seeing things. It is just the cards that I was dealt, and each of us has different cards dealt. It is just part of the game. I wonder if the board will be levelled in the future, and how that will play out, but it seems as something very important to do to acknowledge these differences and realize which are the fights that I need to fight so that I can do the work that I have to do. To play my role in the world just by embodying my own, particular and unique truth. Everything that I’m doing here is moving towards that, towards my own truth.

Which is your truth? How is it expressed through each of your actions? What does ‘being conscious’ mean to you? I have gotten so far out with the understanding of this in my own life that it is hard for me to ‘come back’ and realize which is the normal way of being that people have. What does it mean in reality to not have any kind of connection with what is going on in front of you? What does it mean to be in autopilot 24/7? How does it feel?

Ignorance is bliss, that’s what they say. So am I doing something good for people wanting to help them establish a more conscious relationship with their whole being? Am I truly doing a good to the world with this? I’m not sure about it. But it is something that can’t be stopped, because it feels that it is the natural progression of our evolution. We are becoming more aware of what is going on, and our understanding of reality is being developed more and more. And part of it means a deeper connection with the mistery of it all. Awe. Wonder.

Yes, there is a lot of wonder present, and a lot of curiosity. Why was I born in this place, with this family? What did I come to learn? What does it mean to truly be free? Perhaps that is the question that brings more curiosity into my being. What does it mean to be free? How is life experienced when you are completely free from the burden of having to ‘be someone’? What does it feel like to get rid of the bondages of the ego to everything that has happened throughout the lifetime?

It is important to also acknowledge the work that I’ve done with my meditation practice, showing up each day to dissolve the patterns of behavior that make me tend towards craving and aversion. How is life experienced when these aspects of life are transcended? When my life experience is understood, or integrated, in such a way that I’m not represented by it anymore? There is a big curiosity related to this, and also a big amount of friction. I don’t truly know, and I don’t want to know, I just want to experience. There is a deep craving for experience. For the exploration into the biggest mystery of life. What is this whole thing. And the pointers have been out there all the time. Since the dawn of time there have been people that have done this kind of work, with the alchemy, with the exploration into the depth of the self, so that from that creative source the evolution of humanity can arise. The biggest mystery of them all is the one that lies very deep within the self, and what I’m doing here, in this book, is exploring that with you. Sharing everything that I am with you so that I can go a little bit deeper in the exploration of the mystery within myself. It is the adventure of a lifetime. The adventure of many lifetimes. That reaches its climax in this moment of my existence, on this car, travelling with my parents and my little girl. Just exploring the mundane of life, the conversations that don’t matter, that don’t mean anything, but at the same time, mean everything. Those simple moments of witnessing who is the one that feels separation with these human beings, the most important of them all in my life. This is my family, they are who I am, and everything that happens in these days is a gift towards a deeper understanding of myself.
