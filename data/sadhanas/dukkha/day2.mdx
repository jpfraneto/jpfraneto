I’m here to remember.

What it was to experience life from the sense of I that is built as a consequence of navigating life on planet earth. I’ve been here just for one dukh (88 seconds, as you could say), and it has been crazy. I feel the unease inside that is brought.

I was sent here to witness this process. Of becoming. Of transforming the doing into being. Of expressing what is inside with all of what each of these beings is. There is a deficiency in the way that language is coming forth through me, and that is because of the lack of practice, but hold on, I will do my best.

Part of what I recognize as me did not know how to address this language. It feels kind if weird to be talking from a perspective of ‘me’, as if there was something that separated me from the rest of what is. But it is part of the game that I accepted coming here, to this planet, to be a witness of what is going on here: the enlightenment of a whole species. This book is an exploration into this process.

At this moment I’m not going to talk particularly about a set of tools that can or will be used in this process of collective awakening. That is the means, and the way on which this thing happens is not as important as the underlying spirit of it all. The unfolding of the process withi the system of this being will be shared, so that then it can be extrapolated to the collective. There is an acknowledgment present related to how this process can be made, and the phrase ‘as above so below’ is present. The universe is such an amazing place, with the infinities of the multiple worlds that exist here resembling the infinity in complexity that exist within a single atom. When you travel to the macro and the micro and you discover that they are the same, there is a fundamental shift in how you perceive reality because you end up realizing that all humans are mirrors of each other.

In any action that another human does that has a consequence in you, there is a window of opportunity of exploration into yourself. How that triggers you is the biggest means for you to discover who you are, and this process could be gone through with any interaction, with any person. The human experience is fundamentally the same, a journey from the moment of conception (or before? It doesn’t really matter) to the different stages of life, to the different present moments. In any one of the subsequent present moments that present themselves throughout existence, there is this window of opportunity, of realizing more and more of who you are.

And the process is brutal, because as the vessel starts to get more and more empty of conditioning, deeper and deeper aspects of the conditioning will start to be brought forth. Specifically aspects of the unconscious, which are very wicked. The unconscious is crazy, and as soon as you start being a witness of it you will start feeling that you are crazy too. But the key in that process is to loose the identification with the self, so that you don’t feel that that craziness is who you are. The whole point of this game of exploration is to discover who you truly are, so when this process starts happening just ask yourself: Who is the one that is crazy? Ask yourself that question until there is absolute clarity about the answer. Until there is no one left to answer. That’s when the truth will come forth, and that’s when you’ll truly realize that all those stories that you have been telling yourself all this time are nothing more than a big part of the collective dream.

The collective dream called mind. Everything that exists in this material universe is an expression of mind, and it exists in this reality as a consequence of that. Mind is the interface that unfolds the possibility of nature to exist, and this whole game is about loosening the identification with mind. It is not about negating it, bringing it down, or suppressing its existence, it is about transcending it by realizing that there is something way beyond this small facet of existence. That is the game to play, to be the witness of this process of integration of mind, to realize how to be a witness of mind, and to discover by your own experience, from your own perspective of awareness, that there is something way beyond what you have been experiencing until now.

What is real? Who is the one asking this question? Who is the one reading? Who is the one that feels those emotions? Who is the one that is in love? Who is the one that wants to eat that fruit? Who is the one that is craving for running up the hill? Who are you? Who am I?

This are all valid questions, that have been pushed down in society because they point towards a realization that will set you free. And it may seem that no one really wants you to become free, because it is actually true. If you are free, there is no more opportunity for others to control you, to be there telling you what to do, and one of the fundamental aspects of mind is that it wants to control. The mind wants to know. And if there is a slight possibility of being closer to knowing how another person will react to a particular stimulus, mind wants to be in charge of that. That’s why no one wants you to be free. So let all humanity be no one. Let all humanity realize its true nature, because awareness doesn’t have any preferences. It is not that it wants you to be free or not, that is a separation brought into existence by the mind. Awareness is just aware. But there is a tendency in the process that as more aware awareness becomes of its existence, there is this process of wanting to know. There is something like a primordial thirst that starts coming up. Something is felt inside, as if there was a need to wake up from a long dream.

And that is the stepping stone into the new reality, and what needs to happen for more and more humans to awake. There will be ones that will be the early adopters, as with any shift that has existed in the way that humans relate. When there is a new innovation brought up, there is always a small group of people that are the ones that are able to see what others are not seeing. With this whole thing it is the same. There are ones that will feel that thirst first, that primordial thirst that will have them feel within their whole system that the only way on which they can progress in life is by realizing their true nature.

I’m one of those. I can’t stay up with this suffering. I’m done with it. I don’t want it any more, and I’m willing to do anything that is required to go through that process.

Easier said than done, because it is fucking hard. That’s why community is needed, for bringing together people that are going through this process so that we can help each other in a consistent way. All of those that are doing the work need to come together, join forces, and become the early adopters of this whole thing. They are the ones that will open up the window for the whole species. The first voyagers. The scouts. The consciousness explorers. The ones that will touch the alchemical gold and will come back with the understanding of how to tender the process to all of those who have not yet realized that that is the way forward, because the entanglements of mind are too deep, too strong, and the conditioning is just too extreme.

There is a strong acknowledgment present related to the importance of this tendering process. It is like preparing the soil before the season of planting the new harvests. It is work that needs to be done, and there is people that have a different capacity to do this, or a different understanding of the whole game because of their life experience. Not to judge, there is nothing that is wrong or bad. Actually for the people that don’t have a deeper understanding of what it means to be awake, it will be easier to awake. As you get a deeper and deeper conceptual and intellectual understanding of this whole thing, it gets harder and harder to become free of that understanding so that awareness can realize itself. The mind is a tricky aspect, and it will always want to know. And on that knowing, it will think that it absolutely has all the answers, and that it can become enlightened. At this moment, I think that I’m the one that needs to awake.

And that is part of the dream, because what needs to awake is awareness itself, which is beyond the sense of I that I refer to when I write down the word I. What Is referred to in these words is the image that has been built throughout a lifetime about a person that grew up in a particular family, went to a particular school, played a particular number of soccer matches, drank a (bit too big) number of drinks in his early life, and is very thirsty to know the truth, But that is the concepual and experiential understanding of what ‘I’ is, which has been always limited to this character that has been played.

There is a huge willingness to explore what is at the other side. What remains when that sense of I is transcended. How does it feel. How does that shift in the perception of reality impact the relationship with the amazing little girl that is understanding what the world is and dreams about who-knows-what in the other room next to her mother. How does love feel when there is an absolute understanding that there is no separation between one part of awareness and the other. How is the material world embraced when there is an experiential lesson which taught that it is not real?

But what does it mean that it is not real? That is the mind coming in again, asking its own questions. Of course it wants to know what does it mean that this whole thing is not real. Of course it wants to become awake. And that’s the whole problem. The mind wants to become awake, because it senses that there is a separation between it and the awakening process. And there is no separation, because in the end schema of thing mind is not separated from awareness, it is just part of it, contained in it.

Mind always likes coming in to answer these kinds of questions, it always has an answer for them. And if it doesn’t have the answer, it will incessantly look for it, in whatever practice or tradition it finds. May it be the practice of yoga, breathing and mind altering drugs. May it be the intellectual study of the scriptures, or whatever material comes through. May it be listening to people talk in podcasts, or watching a video created to explain what this whole game is about.

‘Now I’m ready to become enlightened’, so it goes. And the pursuit continues. The process of the horse running towards that carrot that is in front of it starts. The seeker is fueled with more understanding of what to do. How to progress. But eventually that needs to be dropped off, and the more understanding there is, the harder it is. That is why the early adopters of this whole thing will be the ones that will have to do more work, because from their curiosity comes a lot of stuff that needs to be dropped off, for them to truly realize who they are. That is the cosmic joke: The more you care, the harder it gets. But it is okay like that, because it is a very interesting game to play.

So that’s how it plays out. The early adopters will be the ones that will go all around the world searching, searching and searching for answer, so end up realizing that the answer was always there, they just needed to refine the way on which they were searching for it. Or just stop searching at all, and just realizing what has always been there. It sounds so funny when those words come out, because all the things that have been done to get a deeper understanding come forth right now. And it ends up being funny, because jt is a lot. The permanent insatisfaction with life is doing its thing, and pushing the mind’s quest to become free of itself. So there it goes, looking for more, looking for more experiences, looking for more wisdom, looking for more teachers. Going further and further around the circle, just to end up realizing that the circle was just another thing that was built from the mind.

Another cute creation of it to add to the shelf. It is crazy how many of them there are. But it is part of the game. There is an acknowledging of this, and a feeling of acceptance. It is the game that had to be played. Anything more, and anything less. It is just how it is. And the feeling that will come forth from all these realizations is surrender. A deep and true surrender. To end up the game, to end up the race, and just be. And that is where it becomes possible for this whole transformation to happen. The seeker needs to give up.

How does it give up? The sole fact that that question exists is part of the whole thing that has been talked here. Asking how involves getting an understanding of the process that needs to be gone through to achieve something particular. If that question is asked, it is with the expectation to get an swear that:

Teaches what needs to be done in order to give up.

There is nothing that needs to be done! All doing is a consequence of the existence of mind, and this whole thing is about realizing that mind is only an aspect of reality that is going to be transcended. There is not a ‘how’ to do that, because it can’t be done. No one can pass the gateless gate. So be no one. Be that no one that is not doing anything. Just being. Be. Just be. That is the key of this whole thing… Just being.

That’s why were are all here. To explore this reality from the perspective of a human being that is, there is no denial of that. The dilemma arises when the mind of that human being starts thinking, and thinking that it is the one that is in charge. That the only frame of reference that exists is within its perspective. That is where the identification comes from, and with that identification comes the extreme necessity to control. The mind wants to know, the body wants to feel comfort. But spirit just wants to be, and BE through this human being that is writing and reading this words. There doesn’t need to be an intellectual understanding of this whole game, because the intellect belongs to another realm. It is an amazing servant to navigate this physical reality, that is all that it is.

Humanity as a whole will realize that, and the consequence of it will be an exploding towards creative expression. The spark that is deepest within your system is the source of all creation, and as soon as you set it free it can’t be stopped. It undergoes the process of being unleashed. You will be unleashed, and awareness will just use your life experience and everything that you have grown to become as the means to express itself. It’s going to be beautiful. Each human being is the same at its core, just awareness, but the way on which awareness is express in this reality depends on the conditioning that that human being has in its system. On what is present inside of him or her. And that brings up infinite possibilities, because each of us will have the opportunity to create something new. Someting cool. And the tools for this are getting cheaper and cheaper. It has never been this easy to create something that didn’t exist before.

Isn’t that a sign that consciousness is becoming conscious of itself? It has been creating the means for it to happen all this time. It has been preparing the ground of this material world it to happen, to create all the beauty that can be created. All the amazing things that will come. Just for the sake of it. Just for playing the game. It won’t be easy, there will be people that will play they role for this to be hard, but it will happen eventually. It is an energy that just can’t be held inside anymore.

Awareness is becoming aware of itself.

We are in the process of awakening.

The newsletter that this hands started to write is ended up being called ‘Paving the road’. There is no particular clarity on how this came to be, but now there is a clearer understanding of it after having written what was written before. Being the early adopters of this new way of existing is paving the road for the ones that will come later. Doing the work first so that it is easier for the ones that come later. It doesn’t hurt me if I have to work harder to realize my own nature and you have to work less. That comparison itself is part of the problem. What does harder mean what is less? It doesn’t make sense because it is relative to the own experience. It is always relative to the own experience, there is no way to compare within two humans. It is the same as pain. How can we compare pain? It is only relative to one self. The fact that I spend time comparing the amount of pain that a particular situation brought to my life (physical and/or emotional) comes from the necessity of the mind to create comparisons. It is part of its eternal ‘divide and conquer’ strategy, always seeking to understand by building up fake divisions between my experience and yours.

What is a better way to deal with the pain that I have gone through and the one that you have gone through? Just be there for each other’s pain. If you are telling me a story about a moment in which you felt pain, and I respond to that by comparing that story with one of my existence, I’m not holding the space for the resolution of your particular story. I’m acting from a place of selfishness, wanting my story to stand up for myself in the eternal game of status. 
What is the other side of that coin? True empathy. The one that comes from opening up to feel the words that are coming out of you, to resonate with the look of your eyes. They say the eyes are the window to the soul, and having a conversation with another human being is opening up to the possibility of living life through the eyes of the other person. As I listen to you and I resonate with that, I open myself to experience life from another perspective, which is the same as mine but colored by a different story. What an amazing thing this is. Right now what is coming to me is the feeling of being truly there for the other person, just listening and trying to be witness from their view.

Perhaps this is what awakening will bring to us. The opportunity to be able to realize deep down the fact that on the core we are all the same. And the door that that will open is one of not wanting to impose my story on yours, but truly be there for yours to express itself through the interaction with me. We spend so much time trying to fit in every story that we can into each conversation, so that we can show ‘more’ of ourselves in that process. But what ends up happening is an overload of information, an overload of noise that doesn’t lead to true resolution. What if we actively tried to fit in only a small percentage of those stories, and we fully delved into each of them? How would that world look like? Tell the story, be listened to, and in that process fully integrate what that particular story tells you about yourself, with the help of consciousness being witness of itself through the eyes of the people that are listening, truly listening, to your story. Whatever it is. Consciousness being conscious of consciousness. That is the game that we will end up playing. The magical trick that is going on right now. As we go out of the dream state and into what is truly present, we’ll open ourselves to the possibility that we are in charge of just bringing beauty into this world. Love just for the sake of it. Because it feels good to love and be loved. It is the primordial need, the one that is rooted inside the soul. To be loved. Not by anyone other than by yourself. That is the source of true fulfillment, of true happiness. Being loved by yourself. Accepted by who you are, because of who you are, from where you are at. In every moment. That is the game. But probably the hardest of them all. Spending all that time just trying to be loved, just finding means for the world to love you in any sense. Just seeking for that. Inventing stories that tell you that the universe loves you, always seeking on the outside what needs to be developed on the inside. How can you love yourself if you don’t know what you truly are capable of?

When is the moment on which you start creating something? It doesn’t matter what it is. The means that you use don’t matter. Nothing matters more than just doing it. Now the thought comes to mind related to me saying that I needed to ‘learn’ how to play, so that I could truly play with my daughter. Can you imagine that? How can I learn how to play? How can I learn something that is already present inside myself? How can I learn how to be, if that is already present inside me? I am already being, it is just that it is easy to forget. It is easy to fall back into the struggle of wanting to become better at it. Wanting to overcome the particular limitations that are present in this moment so that in the future I can do stuff as I would like to do it. If I could just have a little bit more of fun playing with my girl. Probably if I learn how to play I will have more fun. So I need to learn how to play. What an absolute nonsense… What an amazing, absolute, nonsense. What if I don’t have fun? It is part of what it is, it is time to embrace it, feel it completely, and move on with that awareness of what is actually present in that moment. If I’m playing (not _learning_ how to play, actually playing), and I realize that I’m not having fun… Which is the way to move forward:

    1	Quit the activity with a feeling of frustration, saying to myself that I need to ‘learn how to play’ before I can come back to play again with her?
    2	Continue to play, internalizing the fact that I’m not having fun, and enjoying what that is telling me about myself. Is there something wrong in me if I’m not feeling how I ‘should’ be feeling? 

The crazy part of how our collective mind works right now is that we truly feel weird if we are not feeling something particular that we ‘should’ be feeling. The judgment that follows internally is that there is something that should be changed inside. So the mind enters this whole downward spiral of putting itself down, collecting memories of moments when you were not enough, of moments when things could have been better. What awakening brings us is becoming free of this. It is becoming free of the burden of having to feel a particular thing because it is what should be felt. It is becoming free of shoulding at all. How would you feel if the word ‘should’ would be eliminated from the way on which we relate to each other (and most importantly, to ourselves!).

We come back to the universe of expectations. Anything that should be a particular way is related to the expectation of a particular happening. It is always a projection towards the future, or a complaining about the part. ‘It should have been that way’. Now that I write that, I realize that should is more related to the past than the future. Is it related to the future at all? Can I say: ‘That should look like this in two more years’. Yes, it makes sense. And there is the expectation present in what I just wrote. Always making its noise.

To live life in an awakened state is to experience every moment fully as it is, with an absolute lack of expectation on it being different. Any concept related to how things should look like don’t make any sense, because there is an absolute responsibility on the reasons that brought stuff into being. This is what it means to be conscious. It means to be responsible. To realize that you are the creator of your own reality, and be responsible for that.

I acknowledge that I’m not having fun as I play with my little girl, and I realize that it is a consequence of who I have been my whole life. And I can make a conscious, responsible decision in that moment to continue to live my life like that, or I can decide to embody my being in a different way, right there, in that specific moment. Not blaming anything because of not having the particular sensations that I should have, but just living the ones that are present and building from that. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. Any. No one said that bliss is related to having fun, or to being exultat in a laughter, or being crying tyour heart out. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. That is what matters. To let the emotions arise, and feel them fully. Embrace the human experience with everything that it brings. Without the expectation of them being different.

How would it feel to live life witnessing every moment as an opportunity to explore into the true nature of reality by observing who you are at each moment, through every one of your actions?

Who do you become when you forget who you are and you just are? Or more than forget, when you dissolve. What remains when you dissolve who you are? Who you believe you are?

One of the aspects of this whole game that sticks with me as particularly funny is one that was present throughout the retreat in the Samadhi Center, where I realized that as I moved closer to an understanding of my true nature, it was more and more of the image that most people truly have about myself. Most people have in their mind an image of who I am that is very much connected with my true self, more than what I’m able to recognize because inside me there is always this noise related to not being enough. And I have the feeling that normal human beings are able to see through this veil, and realize that which is behind the layers of what I believe is missing. They are able to better connect with the true nature of my being than myself. It is crazy. The true nature of my being is closer than close to me, but my mind builds a chasm so big in between that those who are not me are able to be a witness of my true nature more than what I’m able to. Despite being that close. It is quite a big paradox that one. 
And the way to cross that chasm is to embrace it. Accept the fact that it is there, and move towards the understanding of how to build that bridge. In my experience, that understanding has been built by discovering different practices that have been very helpful to realize that there is another way of living life. That’s why it is always about doing the work. Because by doing the work you’ll better realize who you are. I have been for 41 minutes already streaming this video in youtube, with no one watching. Probably no one will care ever, but it doesn’t matter because I’m learning more about myself in this process than on doing whatever other thing that I could be doing. I’m being sincere. I’m being true. And that is all that matters, because at the end of the day the truth will hold its place. By doing the work and showing up you will be able to tap better into what makes you uncomfortable, and with that, walk towards it. The only way in is through. No one can do the work for you. No one can show up in the depth of your being and feel what you are feeling.

Quiet the mind, open the heart.
Quiet the mind, open the heart.
Quiet the mind, open the heart.

The messages are out there, waiting to be listened. And by out there I mean everywhere. Inside your system, inside each one of your relationships, inside each one of your posessions. Life is no more than a collection of memories, an eternal thread of moments that follow one after the other, which constitute the marvel of everything that is. This game is not about forgetting who you are so that you can live life in a higher dimension and not suffer from what is present here. It is the absolute opposite. It is about embracing each aspect of existence fully, and learning to be completely present to everything that **is**. Bliss is any emotion fully felt. It is time to experience every moment of life as it was the last one, because it truly is the last one. There won’t be any moment like this one, ever again. That is the beauty of the whole thing, that is what brings aliveness into our actions. That is that future which we will build, creating from the knowing of this as the absolute truth.

Dukkha is about lowering the barriers of the collective mind. It is about understanding more of what you are not, so that you can free up the space for what you truly are to shine through your whole system. It is about entering a new way of relating to everything that is, by establishing a new relationship with everything that you already are.
It is about the truth, that truth that only can be told by direct experience. No one can talk you about it, because anything that your mind could create as a concept about it comes for free with an aspect of division. The mind can only know by generating these concepts as a way of interpreting from its own perspective, and the truth is beyond any concept that can be generated from the mind. It is outside the mind. It is beyond the mind. That is why you have to throw yourself into the void, into the unknown, because no self can enter that space. The self needs to stay here, doing its work, playing the servant, for us to truly shine.

There is a necessity present to acknowledge how amazing this creation is. As my dog plays in front of me and rolls from one side to the other, and my mind scans its body through its organs, through everything that is going on in there. Each part of it is a perfect harmony, all working together to build a sentient being that now is walking towards me to give and receive love. It just wants to be near, to feel. The whole array of things that need to happen for this to be a reality is just amazing, and I guess that this is the moment of this day on which I feel gratitude for all of this. For being here, in this moment, inhabiting and being witness of what is going on around my body. Of the people that I interact with, of the air that I breathe. Of the words that come up, and the knowledge that is created as a consequence of that. I don’t really care about the knowledge that is being shared, I just care about expressing myself. Throwing out these words as they come up is everything I need. I don’t need it to constitute some particular knowledge to help someone progress in any way. It is just an invitation to feel. To resonate with what has been said here, and with the intention behind it. These word are a calling, a deep invitation to be part of something bigger than yourself. Something unknown, because it will be built with the collaboration of many human beings that will each of them create something unique. Each of them brings something unique, so it is impossible to truly know what will happen afterwards. What will be created from here on. But here we are, doing the work. Caring for each other, and just creating. We came here to create. It is time to do it. To enjoy life. To be witness of how amazing it is to be alive.

Society needs those who are willing to explore. Everyone has its own role. Where I live now, there was once a dense forest, which my oldest relatives helped clean so that they could establish themselves here. That is the way on which this place started being populated, and in that moment there needed to be people that were willing to be the first ones, to explore what was going on in there. To develop ways on which relating to the environment so that the rest of them could come and enjoy. It has always been like that, and this movement is not an exception. The first ones that come will be the adventurers, the explorers, and they are in charge of opening the forest, the jungle, for the ones that will come later. They are the ones that come with the machete to open up the density of the mind so that awareness can shine through it, and finally realize itself. They are the ones that will break the egg so that consciousness can hatch from there. It is scary because what lies at the other side is the absolute unknown, but they will be the ones holding the hand for all of those that will come later.

We will create the means for this to happen in the physical world and also in the digital one. It is needed to do it like that, because if not it is impossible to have the reach that is needed. There needs to be places throughout the whole world on which this work is done, for people to be safe, for people to not feel lost after the process of awakening unfolds. This is such an important undertaking, that we need to care for each of those that are going through the process. It is very important to have that in mind. To care about each other. To give each other the space to express, to bring out what needs to be brought out. To truly be free. And freedom comes from absolute trust. We need to build networks of trustworthy people, of people that are willing to speak truth. If you speak your truth, you open up the possibility of not controlling the person that you are interacting with, because there is no more leverage for you use in order to control. And that requires a leap of faith from you. Of knowing that the trust that you are giving the whole system will not defraud you. And this is where the blockchain comes in, because it comes with absolute trust. Don’t trust, verify they say. It seems like verification is a step ahead of trust, but I still haven’t wrapped my mind around this one.

It is only a feeling that is present, that of blockchain being the coming into being of absolute trust in the way that we relate to each other. If everything is transparent, there is nowhere to hide. If there is nowhere to hide, there is an imposed need for trust in each of us, because that is the way on which you will be able to thrive in this new world. If you are not worthy of trust, we all will know it, and that won’t be good for you at all. So start observing your actions, the way on which you interact with life, and ask yourself the question: Am I being truthful to myself? From there you start. You can’t be completely truthful to others if you are not being truthful to yourself. That is the starting point, and as I said before, each moment is an opportunity to inquiry this within yourself. Am I being truthful to myself? But don’t ask it rationally, that is the perpetuation of the game of the mind. Ask it with your heart. Feel it.

Am I being truthful? Observe what feelings arise in your body. Where there is tension. Release that tension as you realize that there is truly no need to defend yourself. All those defense mechanisms are there because of something, and they need to be integrated in order for your true self to express itself through you. You’ve got to do the work of making the unconscious conscious, and that work is done in every moment, as you go through those realizations that come after asking that question to yourself.

Am I being truthful?

How does it feel? Where does it feel? What does that tell you about yourself? The game never ends, but it ends up being so crazy that it is quite funny actually. To be a witness of the games that your own mind plays to you, of how it defends itself, how it always wants to win. But in this game there are no winners or losers, there just are. We just are. That is the direction on which we are headed, and all this writing is for you to be a part of it. To be one of those that will be paving the road. To realize that you are not the only crazy one, that we all are a bit crazy in our own way. That is the interesting part of the journey, to see it from the perspective of each other, and to be amazed by the perspective that each other has in this whole game. What if we approached it as a game, and we had the deep willingness to have as much fun as we can? How would it look like? What would you do every day? What would you spend your energy in if there was nothing to rush towards to? There are many things that are windows of opportunity in the way that we relate to each other, and each moment is an opportunity for realizing that more deeply. We are headed towards a deep transformation, and as this transformation comes forth an evolution will take place. Don’t worry about where it will lead us, just enjoy the ride. It’ll be fun.

It’ll be exciting.

And this community that is being built here is for each of its participants to not feel alone. For each of its participants to recognize its own magic in the eyes of the other person that is part of it, and from there, join our strengths in the creation of the new world. From the ground up. Embracing everything that is, acknowledging the role that it played to bring us to this place, and continuing from there. Not blaming stuff for being different from how it should be. Remember, that should word is not helping us. Witness every shoulding and embrace it as an opportunity to realize that there is an expectation that is not being met. Use every should as a window to realize that there is an expectation that can be dissolved into acceptance of what truly is. Of what has always been. Dissolve the expectations and give you the most amazing gift of your life, that of just being with what is. Giving a strong hug to reality and expressing gratitude for everything it has given to you in this journey that you have understaken. And evolving from there. With the willingness to tend your hand for those who want to listen. For those who want to walk the path. We have already paved it for them. That’s the work we are doing now. Just paving the road, being the early adopters of this whole thing.

It is amazing to be witnessing the becoming of something new. The opening. The coming up to being. The remembering. Remember the future. What a great phrase. It is time to remember the future, and we are here to do just that.

Stare at the future at the eyes and realize that it will never be here, it will always be a distant memory of something that could happen, and in that memory is the information related to how it is always present.

Stare at the past at the eyes and realize that it is ever present in every aspect of reality in this moment. All of who you are is a consequence of everything that has happened throghout your existence. Embrace that, and open up to the possibility that everything that happens is a piece of information in the quest of getting a deeper understanding of who you are.

Of the truth.

Open yourself to the truth of your being, realize who you are, and start living from the infinite openness that comes from that experience. It has never been about becoming something particular, it is about discovering everything that you have always been. And just be that. It is a simple as that. That’s what being enlightened is. Just letting life shine through you, with an absolute lack of resistance. With a deep, unconditional love for everything that already is.

Awaken from the dream. Pave the road for the ones that’ll come. But not for them. For you. Let them have their trip. Let each human being discover the truth of their existence by themselves. Let them discover where they need to work on. Let them realize their own mistakes, feel their own emotions, walk their own path. The one for awakening has been there all this time, now we are just putting the lights on the borders of it so that more and more people can realize where it is. Right into the deepest space within them. No human can walk that road for other human. That’s the game. Realize it, and be free. Just be.

Let your jaw be dropped in awe but how this cosmic play is organized. Let your soul be fulfilled by each moment on which you remind yourself that you are alive, that you are a particular human being, that does not have replacement, that is unique, and that has its own light.

Let your light shine. Let it shine for you, and for all of those who are around you. Let it shine so bright that it can’t be stopped. Let it fill all the edges of this world. Let it just be. Letting the resistance down feels good, try it for yourself. Use every breath as an opportunity to surrender into what is already here. Take every breath as a present, as a miracle, as a window into what has always been and will always be. You. Realize who you are. We’ll be there for you. We have always been.
