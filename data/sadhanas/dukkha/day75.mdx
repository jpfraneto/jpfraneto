The consequences of Doing The Work start showing up and appearing when the act of showing up ends. I can illustrate that with the practice of meditation, which’s intention (at least in myself and my own experience) is to establish a deeper rooting of my consciousness in the present moment. By sitting on meditation I’m better able to realize which are the aspects of myself that keep me anchored to a particular kind of expectation, both related to something that could have been different in the past, or something that can happen in the future. As I sit down on meditation and I witness my experience with an open mind, with the intention of not judging it, with the willingness to accept whatever comes up and don’t fight it, just witness it with equanimity, I walk towards a rewiring of my whole nervous system that is conducing to me being better able in my daily life to relate to it from the perspective of the present moment. The act of meditation produces a rewiring that ends up transforming my relationship with reality. This is something that I had not seen with clarity before, as I don’t have an absolute commitment to the practice as I see my future.

I mean, right now I’m at this stage where it is too challenging for me to go through what I go every day without sharing my practice with anyone else, and I think that if I keep doing it I wont be able to sustain it for much more time. It is very exhausting to be practicing on my own, on solitude, and I feel that I need to bring something different. This is what I have thought about, creating a podcast on which I bring different spiritual leaders to guide a meditation every day, or also using that space for listening to the album of the day. I don’t know what I will end up doing, because the album feels to much because I also want to guide the guest for my Learning to Live podcast through a breathwork session listening to their answer to the question: ‘If you died tomorrow, what album would you take to the other side?’. That is my ever present dream, and here I am, walking the road towards that dream. I know that yesterday’s breathing session for me brought a lot of more clarity into what I’m doing, and I’m moving slowly towards that direction. It feels good, inspiring and motivating. The whole universe of NFTs is getting a big part of my attention, as it is directly and absolutely connected to the theory that I have been developing related to the truth of ourselves as human beings, which is directly connected with the necessity of expressing ourselves creatively.
I know that the future holds wonders for us in the creative sphere, and I’m here to explore that with everything that I have. That’s my mission, and I’m walking the road so that I can better understand which is the place on which I stand with this whole thing. Where is this going. And what is our role as human beings in that. I know that the realization that I had yesterday is huge, and I know that something important comes from it. I just need to frame it better within myself, so that I can embody it and create whatever I will create having it in mind. For what I recall, it is related to the silver thread that unites our consciousness to the material world and which ceases to be present when we are able to come here and fully embody our mission in life. In my eyes, that is to realize our true nature. That is when the bond between consciousness and our body ceases to be permanent, and if all human beings are able to do that we will reach a point on which no one of us will have the need to reincarnate. And with that, what comes is the transcendence of the physical realm, which will happen as a consequence of the technological advancements that are being developed in humanity right now.

Nuclear fusion will give us practically infinite electrical energy, the blockchain will give us the capacity to decentralize our systems, open source will make us create software with the help of anyone that wants to contribute, AI will help us create whatever we want to create. I mean, I try to list the way on which technology will transform the relationship that we have with reality and I can’t even list it, I’m not versed enough in it. But it doesn’t matter, because what matters for me is just to be able to help other people see what they don’t see in their own life and work. I’m thinking about the work that consultants do. They are hired to help people see in their work what they are not able to see, and give them solutions that they haven’t been able to come up with. But is it truly that what is needed? Is it better to give you the fish or to teach you how to fish? I think that is a good analogy, and what I’m doing with the breathwork is helping people realize that what they have for offer is much more than what they can think of. And that is also valid for me. I see my work as something that is not valuable enough, and now as I write this I think: How valuable this whole thing is? I keep pushing myself down, and my capacity to create. What happened with the idea that I had for creating a transformational journey for altMBA alumni? What if I use that network to create something powerful that can help them become more of who they are? Why do I need to be someone specific to come up with something that can transform the way on which this people work and do their thing? What if I come up with an absolutely new way of doing consultancy, by teaching these people how to fish, instead of giving them the fish? What if I worked with high impact individuals? With those that are in charge? What if I trusted enough in what I have to offer so that I could give them the opportunity to work with me? No one is coming to save me. It is just me the one that needs to learn how to navigate the world, and in this sense, it is important to realize that my thing is not directly related to money. Yes, it is something important, but the most important thing of them all is my acknowledgement of the impact that I can have in people’s lives. That is something that I still don’t embody completely, and part of what has me here, in the maze of my own mind. I’m navigating that journey of understanding, day after day, embodying a little bit more of what I bring so that I can help heal the world. That is the journey on which I am, and the currency that is being paid in the world right now, and in the future, more important than money is attention. Is that true? Is attention a currency?

I don’t even know. It doesn’t matter to me right now. What matters is to go a bit deeper in this understanding that I have of myself, and of the value that I bring into the world. Because, at the end up the day, the money paid is a representation of the value added, and I have not been paid a salary by someone different than my father for a long time. Is it that I have not been able to add value to any people’s life? I don’t think so. I definitely add some kind of value to the people that I interact with, it is just that I have not been able to capitalize that value in a way on which I can do it with intention. I just do it because it is the way on which I exist, but it is time for me to do it in a way that is inspiring for others, so that there can be a transfer of wealth that recompensates what was done, and that transforms me and the other person in the process. I’m just going through that process of evolution right now, and it is quite interesting. I’m learning how to do it as I go, and it is just that I’m training myself that I’m not able to charge any money for my services yet. But is there going to be a moment on which I can shift this perspective and start charging for the work I do? For sure, it needs to happen. And what does that perspective bring into myself? The necessity to be part of something bigger than myself. That is what the economy brings to our life. If you have a business, you are actually being part of something bigger than yourself. You are impacting the world in a way that is more than the direct impact that you have. And that sounds like a very interesting perspective. Being able to bring more and more of that sounds important. Which are the ones that I want to impact? Who is the people that I want to help? Who are the ones that I want to serve? How do I want to serve them? I keep coming back to the ‘People like us do things like this’. Is it that the people that go through the challenges that I do are also the ones that will be open to be part of what I create? That is something that I need to have in mind in order to build what I will build.

But how do I do it if I don’t have any connections? I just reach out, you know? It is not that I don’t have connections. I do have them. It is just that I’m not able to accept it, to witness it, to accept it as a reality. There are people that I have impacted in my life, who know who I am, and I’m sure that if I’m able to develop something interesting they will be more than happy to be part of it. That is the mission that I’m embarking in. That is what I bring into the table. And it is important that I’m able to embrace everything that I bring so that I can fully embody it, and work from there my way towards transforming the life of people. All these people waiting to be transformed by what I do. And here I am, doing my best to do it. Doing my best to navigate the modern world so that I can understand where to move. It is incredibly complex, and the amount of opportunities are infinite. Which is the next step? How do I promote my work? I tend to get lost in the maze of my own mind, instead of just taking care of being clear with my intention. Which is my intention? To bring more clarity into the life of people, to help them lift the fog, so that they can become more and more of who they have always been. So that they can embody every aspect of themselves and be able to translate each part of those aspects into a unique act of creation, which will be the consequence of all their life experience.

That is the thing that this whole book is about. Just helping people realize that they are a creative force of nature, and that the more that they connect to the truth of who they are the clearer this is expressed through each one of your actions. Work so hard on yourself that you end up having the craving, the necessity, the urge, to create something that did not exist before. That is what this whole book is about. And it connects to the first thing that I wrote today, which is related to the meditation process starting when you get up from the cushion. It’s the same here, as I go through the writing of each one of these words. I’m actively meditating here as I write, since the goal of my process is to be present in what I’m doing, so that I can enter that state of flow that will have as a consequence that I’m able to pour my purest self into what is being created now. The more you lift the fog and see with more clarity what is within you, the better you are able to manifest that into the consequence of the act of creation. The more you are able to melt into the act of creation, and come up with something new, novel, that ends up being a manifestation of what you are. A manifestation that lasts, and that other people can witness as the vehicle for exploration of your truth. That is the thing. That is the truth. And we are walking towards that, and everything that is happening in the world is just an exploration into that. Beauty is being generated through each one of our acts, it is just that we are not able to realize it fully yet. But we are walking towards that. Step by step.

The meditation process starts when you get up from the cushion, and the consequences of the creative act manifest themselves in your whole relationship with life. It is crazy how until now life has been so segmented, from one activity to the other one, as if there was no clear connection between them. You are in your house, you go to work, to the gym, to the bar, and the relationship between each one of those activities is not well understood. Or approached in a constructive way. The effect that going to the bar can have in work is immense, as you may end up having a conversation that transforms the way on which you do things. So by having this invented limitation we don’t allow the genius to shine in every moment.

And it is time for the genius to shine. It is time for us to be able to express that creative part of us in everything that we create. It is just the moment for it. I’m here writing about all these things and it is my way of doing it, you know? Because all of these words are a consequence of my genius wanting to be expressed in some way. Of what I have inside wanting to be manifested into something that can exist outside me. That is the thing. I could stop writing because it doesn’t make sense anymore, but I’m not doing it because I want it to make sense. I do it because there is a need inside me to do it. That is what people don’t get about the impact that AI will have in our creative expression. Which is the driver behind your act of creation? Is it the transformation that comes from the act of showing up, or is it that you are trying to please someone? What is the motivation that you have? How are you different because of it? That is the thing. What does it give you in your circle. Which is the new thing that you can talk about because of having gone through that act of creation? How did it transform you and each interaction that you have in your life?

What comes now is something that I read a while ago related to life being a play on which status roles are a big part of it. The more that you impact your status in relationship with the network that you are part of, the more self worth you are able to feel in yourself because of that. We are social beings, and in that, the way on which others perceive what we do is the means by which we are transformed by that. The perspective that others have about us is incredibly important, and it is time to acknowledge that in my writing so that I can better understand which are the next steps having that in mind. Is it that I need to understand that in order to get which the next steps are going to be? I’m in this maze, running around, finding the way in. The only way in is through. I’m going through it, but not completely realizing which is that way in. Not completely realizing that the means by which I’m going to be able to do what I have to do is just by showing up. But showing up for what? For the creative process. And you know, the important thing is to know that I have something to offer. I have something that the world needs, and I already know which are the next steps that I need to take. I just don’t realize it yet. But I will. I’m going to make it, it is becoming more and more clear, and in that, there will be an unleashing of everything that I have inside into something that will be huge. I have the opportunity to build up the world on which I want to exist, and in that, become more and more and more of who I have always been. That is the whole game that I’m playing here, which is repeated over and over. I’m becoming more of who I have always been, and each situation that I encounter is an interface into that. To see me doing it. To witness what it brings to me.

Yesterday I joined a friend that went to eat a pizza at night, and now I’m able to look back and realize that throughout the conversation I was not conscious enough of what was going on. I was deep into the interaction, bringing my best into it, but offering too much unsolicited advice. I know that the best thing that I can do for others is asking questions and being as curious as I can with the place where they are at, and I know that I was not able to do this fully yesterday. But we had an amazing conversation, and what I’m talking here is part of this process of becoming more conscious, more responsible. The next time that I’m with a friend that I haven’t seen for a while, I will do my best to be aware of the fact that I’m breathing, and with that, be able to open up to what is going on at the other side. To see me in the eyes of the other person. To witness what is happening. Be with it. Experience it.

I think that it is important for me to acknowledge that I will not be able to create something absolutely incredible in a technical sense, that is not the game that I’m best suited to play. I’m here to discover better who I am by interacting with people like you, and the game that is better for me is the one of showing up with people and helping them realize that I’m walking towards the same direction that they are. And that is what comes next. Sharing myself with clarity, with commitment to the truth, so that I can embody whatever is expressed in my system in the conversation with the human being that is at the other side. I’m here to explore who I am by interacting with people like you, and in that sense, I’m just navigating the waters of the willingness to explore. How are we going to explore? What will it bring to us? What will all this exploration bring? I don’t know, but I want to find out. In each moment. Through every experience. Every second that comes by is an invitation into that exploration, and in the openness to interact and communicate with other human beings there is incredible value. There is something that is transformed in there, and I’m in charge of that transformation. From within myself, and from there to the outside.

Yesterday I realized that I have not been able to acknowledge my journey so far in a way that honors it completely. I take it for granted, you know, and in that I forget how amazing it has been. Since I went to that journey around the world 5 years ago I have been exploring what it means to be me, I have been establishing the foundations of everything that I will do in my life. I have realized that it is me the one that needs to be in charge, the one that needs to be responsible for myself, and in that I decided to establish the most solid foundations of them all: Realizing my true nature so that I can act in the world from there. Until now, it has been this journey of exploration, of becoming, of evolution. I have spoken about it as a journey of evolution, which has me now meditating 1 hour in the morning, consciously breathing 2 times every, coming up with this stream of consciousness since 75 days ago, and doing all the stuff that I do to become a clearer version of myself. But you know, that version is already there. It is time to share it. Yesterday I was in this meeting and when it was my turn to talk I was very funny, and the consequence of that was that we laughed and it was great. That is something that I bring into the world and I forget. Laughters. I have always been a person that gives energy to laughter, that says funny things, that helps people have a good time. That is the thing that I love. Helping people have amazing times, by connecting them with what it feels to do something that they are not used to. I have explored that in different ways, and I have always been successful. Always a lesson learned. And now is not a different time, because I’m creating something that will bring stuff to the people that will be part of it that was not there before. What I’m going to create will help people create, and in that, transform their world. I see so much potential in the world of NFT’s that I want to bring more and more of this. Into everything that I do. Into everything that I am. I become who I am by helping people like you create. That is my new motto, the one for today.

It changes every day, and that is the interesting part about it. Why keep it static. I am different every day, you know? I may be repeating myself, I may be saying the same things that I was saying yesterday, but it is just part of what is. I don’t completely remember what was written the past days, and it is ok. If it is repeated, it is because it is needed energy. The more and more I’m able to give it energy the clearer its manifestation will be. Is this even true? I don’t know. It just came like that, but I know that eventually too much energy can blur the thing. I think it is important to find a balance between the energy that it is given through bringing it into this writing, and also the energy that is brought to it by sharing it with the world openly, in something that is manifested, with which people can interact. More than reading. There are people that don’t like reading, and it is perfect like that. How do I reach those? What is the means by which my writing approaches those that don’t like it? And I mean, probably no one will read this, so it is even more important to be able to find something that is a concrete creation with which people can interact so that this writing can have an impact. And I mean, I am that creation, you know? I began this day talking about the true work starting when you stop Doing The Work, and in that sense, everything that I’ll do when I get up and go to do my thing in life is that manifestation of my truth in action. I become that truth, and it is important to acknowledge it. The meditation starts when I get up from the cushion, and it is in that that I open the door of transformation in the life of others. That’s my mission, and I become more of myself if I open up to be in service of that mission. Of being myself, in the interaction with others.

I’m so grateful to have the opportunity of being in presence of others. Of just being with them. Exploring what that brings to me. Exploring how it feels to see life from their eyes. To just be there for them. As I walk the road I better understand how to do it, and it brings joy. It brings compassion. For them, and more than for them, for myself. The compassion that is needed to realize that life is a journey, one that is discovered as more and more of it comes by. I’m navigating the journey with everything that I have, with everything that I am, and in that exploration I thrive. There are things that I have to work on, some things that I need to be able to realize in my experience that will be the ones that make me understand better how to navigate this journey, but I’m good, you know? I’m doing good. I’m happy. My daughter is the most amazing human being that I have seen ever, and my wife is also incredible. We are uncovering who we are together. And in that exploration there is infinite amount of wealth. Of joy.

So yes, I have written this whole book as an exploration into what the creative act means in the life of a human being. How we came to this place to create, and how in my view that is the mission of our soul in the materialization of consciousness in this world. I’m here to help people connect to their truth, to shine a light into their truth so that they can be able to see it themselves, and with that, connect to their purpose. And I know that their purpose is not related to the specifics of what they do. It is more about the embodiment of who they are, in whatever they do. In whatever circumstance they are in. It is just in that that they will be able to manifest who they are, embody it, and become more of it. And if I want to be in service of this mission I need to be intelligent, and not throw myself into the mouth of the lion by trying to share this with people that won’t listen. Nope. The ones that won’t listen are the ones that are going to drown my energy, and I don’t need that. Humanity will go through the process of awakening, and it is in that process that I need to better realize which are going to be the ones that wake up first. So that later those can be the ones that will wake up the others. And the exponential process will start to happen exponentially. I mean, we are already in the exponential curve, we have always been, and it is important to realize and think why we haven’t got there yet. What is it about our experience as human beings since the dawn of time that has made it so hard for us to wake up to our true nature? What does it even mean to wake up to our true nature? I’m not sure about it, but I know that it is part of the puzzle that I’m trying to unravel with the work I do. With the steps I take, day after day. Moment after moment. I’m walking towards something, and it is in that something that I need to ground myself so that I can walk with consistency, with the clarity of the path ahead. And more than that, with the clarity of my inner compass, of the drive that I have inside of turning me upside down so that everything that I am can be manifested through each one of my actions. Through each one of my interactions. Through each one of my beingness. We are evolving, and the means by which we will evolve is just by realizing that we are already complete. It is just the noise that won’t let us see it. But we’ll get there, and we will wake up as a collective. And when that happens, there will be a fundamental transformation in the way on which we experience reality. There will be a rebirth.

We are being birthed as a collective. It is time for it.

It is time for each soul to be expressed as the truth of its beingness in this world. The human body is the means by which awareness becomes aware of itself, and in that, we end up experiencing the wonders of our beingness. Of what it means to be. Of what it means to exist. Life is such a precious gift. The most important of them all. I’m grateful for every human being that came before. I am because of you. I express my gratitude, which is felt in every cell, and with that, I call upon you to help me better realize which are the next steps. What needs to be manifested through me. What are the ideas. But, you know? I’m thinking about the next steps as I go through this journey right now. I’m being here, writing this book, and this is the next step. This is what is happening here, right now, and it is important to acknowledge it so that I can do it properly. So better than the next steps, just I want to summon each human being that has existed so that they can give me the clarity that I need to bring about words that can help me better discover my truth. I’m here because I want to realize the truth of my being. I’m here because it is never enough, and I’m absolutely tired of the suffering. Of running on circles. Of not being able to get out of my own mind. This world is Dukkha, the eternal suffering, and I’m here, showing up once more, so that you can help me get out of here. Through this writing, I honor everything that I have been, everything that I am, and I recognize it as enough. It is enough. I’m ready with it. It is time for me to wake up, to realize the truth of my beingness, so that I can show that to others. So that I can transform the speech that I have been running around with all this time into a new one, one that is based on my own experience, one that comes from a place of truth.

In that sense, I don’t have any problem whatsoever to acknowledge that everything that I have been writing about, all this time, is based in something that is not true. It doesn’t come from a place of truth. It comes from a place of wanting, of craving, of exploring, of looking for, but it is not the truth. I have not experienced the truth of my being, but I know it is there, watching to me, each one of my actions, from closer than close. It is so close, that actually I can’t see it. My own beingness won’t let me realize it. It won’t let me be free. It is so close that I will always miss it, and that’s why the “I” that wrote that needs to disappear. He needs to be dissolved in the truth of beingness, so that from there my own and particular truth can arise. And with that, show me the path forward. Or inward. Show me the path to everything that I am. You have been watching me all this time, doing everything that I have done, and you know how much I’ve put into this. I know that there is something more to my experience as a human being that what I have seen until now, and here I’m summoning every master that has ever existed to help me realize the truth. I need help, and I come here with honor, with compassion towards myself, and with humility. With the humility that is needed to acknowledge that I know nothing. I’m no one. And I’m willing to give up everything that I have, everything that I know, so that I can realize the truth of my beingness. My own and particular truth. I don’t want it to be ‘the’ truth. I don’t want to impose anything in others. But I’m done with the suffering. It is enough. I want to be free. And this is me, raising my hand and telling each one of you: help. I need you. Show me the way.
