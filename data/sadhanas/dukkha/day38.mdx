This is one of those days on which my brain feels like it is going to explode. There is a lot happening in there, and I have not been able to build myself the time to give it some space. I mean, I slept a lot in the morning, but the kind of time that I feel I need for giving some space in there (meditating and writing) I have not been able to build it. I feel it, and because of that, I’m going to double down on that feeling by giving myself permission to just go and enjoy my little girl now. It is time for that. The vacation continues.

During all the day there has been this eternal willingness inside myself of being in a place different from that which I am now. Always running away from the present moment, searching for something that feels will never come. And it is exhausting. I have everything that I could have hoped for, but it is never enough. Nothing is enough. It’s funny, because I say that I have everything that I could have hoped for but I don’t have the most important thing of them all, someone to talk with right now. I was in the car and I said to myself: I will call a friend. But then I asked myself: Who could I call? Who do I really want to talk with right now? Who can understand what I’m going through? No one understands. But no one understands nothing really, that is the thing. I think that because I am in this process of spiritual awakening I’m special, but I don’t realize that I’m not. It is the part of me that is full of shit that is talking. The egoistic one. The one that wants to wake up, but from which my big self will wake up from. That is the one that is speaking when I refer to myself as someone special because I’m going through this process. Who is the I that I refer to? Who is the one that is writing?

That is the interesting part.

What is going on in the life of every human being is informing to mine. The fact that I think that I’m special and I can’t relate to others because of this is what brings me to isolation, and to not being able to know what to create that can resonate with the people that will follow. I am the one that puts himself in an island, and is not willing to get out of there because it the place where I’m always running from.
There is like a thick layer of fog inside me that makes it hard for the words to come out. I forgot how to do this thing. I forgot what I was building, what I was writing about, what was going on in my life. In my whole being. The most important part of my life was happening, and I put myself in the middle and now it is lost. For wanting to resonate with the people that I was with, a lot of my behaviors changed, I put inside my body stuff that I was not used to, and now I feel that I lost a lot of the progress that I had done before. But is that even real? Is this progress lost in any way? That is the part of me that wants to achieve, that wants to get somewhere. He is the one that is scared that it will never happen. The most brutal part of truly wanting to wake up is the feeling that you will not make it. That you are not worthy enough. That it is not your time. The mind’s fear playing with you its strongest card. One that it is hard to know how to avoid. I mean. At least now, it feels impossible. I truly don’t know how to get away with that one. And there is a sensation present related to all this time having been wasted. What was I doing all this time trying and trying to wake up? Is that even possible? Is that something that can happen?

That’s why this book is called Dukkha. Because in here, I’m sharing with you the nightmare of being inside my own mind. The nightmare of always wanting something different, of building for myself the perfect life, of exploring every avenue that is in front in order to reach a particular outcome that doesn’t exist outside because it has always been here. It is so brutal to know this from the rational aspect of being, but now knowing how to translate it into a way of experiencing the world. As part of the truth by which I interact with everything that happens in front of me. I know that it is inside my own mind, but I truly don’t know how to get out of there. I mean, coming here and writing all this kind of relieves the pain, but… Sometimes it is hard to provide myself the time to do it.

Anyway, the transformation is hard. The resistance is big. The willingness to control, to know, is one of the deepest ones of them all. At least inside me, it feels like the thing that commands everything. Like the one that is in the drivers seat. Control is in the drivers seat, and I don’t really know how to ask him to make some space so that I can hop in. It is brutal. I feel lost. I feel that I don’t truly know where I’m walking towards. What is happening in here? Which is the value that I’m adding to the world?

It is my capacity to reach out to people and leave an impression. That is something that I often underlook, and don’t give myself enough credit for. It is time for me to build up that credit, and open it to the world. There is an enormous value in the way of being that I have. That willingness to talk to strangers. To see the person at the other side of the conversation. To be curious. To explore. To learn. There is a huge breaking in my heart knowing that I won’t be able to reach out to most of them, I won’t be able to listen to their stories, I won’t be able to read every blog post, I won’t be able to study every book, I won’t be able to learn as much as I would like. It will never be possible. But it is ok. I can become free of that, by just learning how to be the most transparent version of myself. And I can only do that by sharing my truth, and my truth is created each time that I sit down to have a conversation with another human being. That is something that has come up a lot during these times.

It feels like the giving up of the effort is to stop talking about awakening at all. Stop giving it such an important space. Just let it happen, as I deepen my relationship with myself by exploring what every other human being has on offer. Build up the space for conversations to be had. Which is going to be the frame on which this conversation will be held? There is a big resonance in me that the biggest healer of them all can be just to have a conversation with another human being. To see yourself in the eyes of herself. Of the other self. Explore who you are by opening up to know who the other person is. And that can only happen if I open myself to it. It is the magic of being who we are. It is the magic of resonating with the story of who is at the other side. I can’t put myself labels. No label will fit. JPing. That is who I am. I’m just exploring who I am by interacting with people like you. That is everything that comes. Just open myself to the world an witness what is at the other side. It is magic. It is the truth. It is everything that I am, by exploring everything that I can be. Today I did the work at half, because I did not sit down for as much as I would have liked. But it is ok like that. Tomorrow is a new day. Now it is time to go and give love to my little daughter that is sick.

Thanks life.
