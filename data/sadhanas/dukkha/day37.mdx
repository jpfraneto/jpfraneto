This is one of those days after having done something that is not ‘good’ for me, that I “shouldn’t” do if I was serious about this thing (is that even something real?), but I just did it and it was very important to go through it. I smoked a lot of pot and went to the cinema, to see the latest superhero film that was available. When I arrived there I didn’t really know which film we were going to see, but it was that one and it is perfect. One of the most important things that I have realized the past years related to films is that -wait. I need to stop myself here and process a little bit not what I just already wrote, but where is it coming from. That aspect of myself that blames me for doing something specific is present here, it is present in the way on which I approach how I feel, and it is present in the way on which I started writing what I write. In this moment I acknowledge it, and I Do The Work of realizing that it is an integral part of the way on which I have behaved as a human being until now. Always judging myself and others because of what they do or don’t do, and this builds up a notion of separation that is helpful for no one. At least not for myself. I did it, I smoked all that pot, and it brought huge realizations for me. It helped me better connect with the person that my wife is, and with who I am in this whole adventure of being a human being. It helped me be a clearer witness of that which makes me feel separated, and I have the feeling that it brought a little bit more of the understanding of how to bond those separations into becoming integral. Always remember, with anyone that I encounter, meet them where they are at. This whole spiritual ego thing is very dangerous, because it can build up a notion of separation from the experience of another being just because of what has been done in life, and that is not helpful for me. It is important that I’m able to acknowledge that, and also acknowledge the place where I am at. Give up the bullshit, and just be there for every interaction that takes place in front of my domain of action. And the most important part about this whole thing is that in speaking about shoulds, I stop speaking about what actually happened, and I stop digesting what it brought to me. So each moment that I give energy to blame myself for something that already happened, is a moment on which I’m not able to give energy to build from there. To create. To invent stuff. And that is what I want to do, so I guess it is time to stop blaming myself and just let arise what comes after the experience of yesterday.-

So yes, we went to see this movie called Black Adam and it reminds me about something that I have been thinking a lot these last years which is the relationship that films have with the state of the art technology for producing them. The special effects in this movie were amazing, and having superheros that are connected to the real life is a huge avenue into the understanding of how to apply these effects in the scenario of the film itself. That is something truly amazing, because indeed yesterday the special effects were incredible. I can’t say that I completely followed the story and that I was able to really understand what was going on, but there is something very important present that it brought to me related to the word Adam. To that name. Historically it has been associated with the image of the first son of god, and in the film there is something related to this. He was the champion, the savior of his people, and the film ends with him being depicted as the one that starts a new way of being of his people. As I said before, I don’t recall completely how every aspect of the film went together, and I certainly don’t know how this fits with the big picture of what is going on, but it is always very interesting as a spotlight of where humanity is right now to go and see these kind of movies. They are the ones on which the studios spend the most amount of money creating them, and they are very popular among the general public. There is a huge aspect of how popular superheros are, and this is because of the story that each one of them has behind. The fact that we can go and relate to humans that were living 2500 years ago and those that live now, and that there are superhumans that are present in the whole story, is something that brings a lot. I will start to bring more of this into myself, because it is truly food for my soul. It brings me towards human nature.

I feel that the idea of having a cinema is very connected to my heart, and it is a great way on which I can bring everything that I care about into the world. Yesterday I ended up realizing how far I am with my thoughts and what I care about from a normal human being, and this kind of instances could be the means for me to bring more of that into the world. I have been taking myself too seriously lately related to the impact that I want to have in the world and what I want to create in order to catalyze the process of awakening of humanity, but what if this is just related to creations? To set free the imagination of the world? Maybe that is what is needed. What was very present yesterday as I was watching the film was to create a chain of cinemas in every part of the world, but small ones. For the place where there isn’t something big. For places like mine. Now I realize that Puerto Varas resembles every other small city in the world, and that I can start creating something here for the people that live here, and from that, open up to the rest of what is outside. I remember this book that I shared with my brother, and in it the guy speaks about starting a chain of something, and how that chain could be started just in one place. That is the big thing, and that is what the infinite jest has been about all this time. It doesn’t need to be on a cinema, the cinema is the excuse. But what if the cinema was just a small store with the most amazing decoration, and that would be the showcase of what happened outside? And what happens outside is independent film creation. How long does a film take to be created? This is a big question, because it is the time that is needed until the project can truly start. I have loved this idea since the dawn of time, and it goes very much connected with The Infinite Jest. The film in David Foster Wallace’s book which was so entertaining that if you started watching it you died. But what if that dying is really transcending the human aspect of you are by realizing your true nature? What could The Infinite Jest be in this sense? A movie that is running 24/7 and that is related to all the amazing films that humans have created. That is something that is always in my heart, and having a place in downtown where that could happen is a dream of mine. And having a remote worker in each small city of the world that could use it as his office. That is all what it takes. It doesn’t need to be big, it just needs to be. This project has always been around myself, and as I went yesterday to the cinema it came with more strength. We are not used to watch movies because of our daughter, but nowadays people more and more spend their time watching series, which are an enormous elongation of time spent being entertained. What if that time was more focused, and with that, they could free up time for doing different stuff? For creating? For building? For imagining? For just playing? It is so hard for me to realize how to make progress, because one day I have one idea and the next one I have another one. It is crazy. But what came yesterday was the realization that yes, people need drugs for their mind to be opened. In my Twitter course they have talked a lot that as you build an audience you talk to your former self, who you were 1 or 2 years ago. Who was I in those moments? Every Friday night smoking a huge joint and then sitting down to watch the movie of the day. A movie that I didn’t know what it was. That is a huge part of the whole thing, the not knowing. For it just to start. That is the element of surprise that will make this whole thing successful. The minds of the people that go need to be bent all around, and the fact that they go and don’t know what movie they are going to see is perfect for this.

What if there was a cinema that afterwards turned into a place where people could talk about what just happened? Another thing that came yesterday was related to specific topics of interest. For example, there could be videos of X topic played every Tuesday at the same time, and it would be something like a random person teaching something about a particular subject. There is a strong resonance in me related to how to interplay all the elements of modern society in this whole thing.

What if I transform myself into the creator of film scripts and I write one every week and people build a film about it and in the film there are superheroes and those superheroes are then characters on Twitter? What if there was a movie character of black adam? I guess that that is the way on which AI is going to come more and more into our lives. By realizing the personality that different human beings have, or even ficticial characters, and being able to build up a persona of them on the internet which will interact with us as if they were real. Imagine there was a profile on twitter that was black adam. It would be the perfect marketing, and the perfect way of coming into the platform with hype so that people could interact with him. That is the perfect ghostwriting really. Putting yourself in the shoes of a character like this and doing the marketing for it on the background. This feels like a way on which the boundaries of what is possible are going to be dissolved.

And what comes now is: How can I simplify what I’m talking about here so that I can bring it into the world? How is this whole process related to what I have been talking in this manifesto all these days. Am I a bit lost again? Is it time to do something to put myself back on track? Those are very valid questions, and if you are reading this you may be able to realize how much of a maze my mind is. It is crazy. Well, the mind is crazy, it is just that we don’t give it the place for it to be expressed. What is stored deep into the unconscious is very weird, and a big part of mine is coming through this writing. Each day that I sit down it gets weirder, and the understanding of this as the way on which to make progress gets blurry. But I’m doing progress. I’m creating something. I’m adding value to the world because I’m becoming more of myself through every one of these words. I decided that I would write a book, life has given me that opportunity, and this is me just doing it. Finding the joy in it, discovering the awe that comes from witnessing myself doing so different things. Last year these deep work sessions were absolutely focused on programming, and now they are on writing. What will they be in the future? What is the schema that runs through all of this? I don’t really know, but it is very interesting to witness it. The important thing is putting it out, so that people can know it exists.

No one really knows. No one truly knows what I’m going through. But that is true for each and every human being. It is not that I’m special because I’m going through the process of awakening. I feel special about it, because all of my being feels that it is a consequence of having ‘Done The Work’. I know myself better than 99% of the people because I have consciously done that. I have put myself in every position that I have found to know myself better. Is that even true? I haven’t worked in a job in an environment that is something that I don’t like. I haven’t truly exposed myself to the world. So is it true that I know myself more than 99% of the people? Maybe that is more and more of that bullshit that keeps running as noise telling me that I’m full of shit because I feel and think that I’m in a place different than those around me, and that I have to do something specific to put myself at the level of them. I need to do what they do so that I can become more connected to who they are. That is a pattern of action that has been present since I started drinking alcohol, where I felt that for resonating I needed to drink, so that I could become free of that voice and share my truth. But is it really my truth, or I am numbing something that I don’t want to see? That is the trick with alcohol and drugs. You end up not being able to go deeper, because you are comfortably numb. I was comfortably numb. And now I witness myself taking drugs and realizing, which is the aspect of them that makes me connect with them? I wonder where are the other people in terms of this whole awakening thing. Because I truly feel isolated, I truly feel alone. I don’t even know if it is something that should be talked about. For example, if I went to the house of my yoga teacher next week, would I ask him about waking up? I don’t feel comfortable with that, because there is this whole persona built around the spiritual aspect of wanting to be more spiritual. And where does that come from? I’m absolutely lost with this thing. Really. I keep running around the maze of my own mind, trying to get somewhere but not knowing where that somewhere is, and with an aspect of my mind telling me that that somewhere is just a mirage because there is nothing to be searched for because it is already here. As Dan said, it is closer than close. It is already present. And how can I move towards it? By not moving? By just doing?

Yesterday I wondered: How would an enlightened person feel if he got drunk? Or high? Or took some mdma? I wonder all of these things, because with the intense feelings and sensations that I have inside a big part of me thinks that there could be damage done. But how could I be damaged if I live a healthy life (?) and I take care more than 99% of the rest of the human beings who eat a lot of shit and don’t take care of their body at all? Do I really care about mine? What kind of sports have I done in the last week? Ahá! I’m beginning to uncover the BS in there. That is the magic of this game, to be able to unlock that BS and spot it. And witness it. And realize that it is not going away. It is just part of what is. And that is the process that I need to go through to be more conscious. Each time that there is a thought going on, stare at it, and realize that I’m not it. I am the one that smoked pot yesterday, and I enjoyed it a lot. Everything that came with it. But I’m not the one that now is blaming himself for having done it. Or that has these deep cravings for something that now is shining through: Being loved.

The fact that most of my aspects as a human being are ruled by the word ‘should’, is a message related to how much I care about what other people think. About fitting in their minds. And in my own. I have my own image of who I am, of what I do, of what I like, or what I don’t like, and I’m not able to break free from that image. I’m absolutely and completely identified with it. And it feels like the only way on which I’m going to be able to bring that into the earth is to go anon. To start sharing all of who I am from a place different from who I think I am. If I talk about myself as the name and character that I have been identified with all my life, it will be harder and harder to break free from the stuff. But if I open up the door for a new understanding, things will start happening from there. What is happening here is truly that I’m crafting the way on which I’m going to exist in the world. Yes. That much time I have available in my system. That is the huge necessity of control that I have. Holy shit, it is very crazy. Always controlling, everything. Always wanting thins to be in a particular way. But it doesn’t work like that. It can’t. It is just too much of a nightmare, of a prison, from which it is very necessary that I break free. And which is the path towards that breaking free? Becoming. Just being. Trusting. Opening up. Listening. It is not when I talk that I learn, it is when I listen. But I think that I’m very interesting, and that is why I love listening to my voice. There is a big aspect of myself that thinks that what I have to say is more important than what the rest has to say, and because of this, I keep doing the talk. I keep identifying with what I have to say as if it was the most important part of them all, not realizing that it is not. The important part is listening to others, it is to be there for them. That is what is very present in me right now, as I discover more and more of this whole thing. As I move more and more towards that place that is always moving with myself, getting further and further. Which are the mysteries of the universe? What lies out there? What is it that is being created through me? Which are the actions that I should be performing? There goes that nice word again. Should. Is there a moment in history on which you stop visiting me? I wonder. Am I the only human being that worries about this? Am I the only one that spends this much time debating with myself about the aspects of myself that should be different but realizing at the same time that each shouldding is a construct of my own mind and that it is ok to give it up and just continue to move forward with what wants to be expressed through me? What is that? What am I here for? Who are the ones that are waiting to be impacted by all of what I do?

Right now I’m listening to Human Music, the radio that I created, and it is just amazing. Truly. The music that is in there is perfect, it is a selection of pieces that has brought a lot into my life, and it is very important for me to acknowledge that because of the journey that has been travelled. I created it and it adds a lot of value, it is just that people don’t know it yet. Because I haven’t been able to share it in a way that is compelling for people to go in and start using it. But in the moment that I do it, it will change the way on which a subset of people in the world exists, because it is just amazing. Simple, and amazing. The best. It will be important for me to reconfigure it again, to create the layout in a more modern way, so that it can be more appealing to people. They don’t come because there is nothing that reminds them that it exists. I have to have that in mind. I know it exists because I have created it, but it is not something that the other people have in mind. They just go with their thing, and do their thing. And it is also important to witness the workflow of people as they go in it. For example, if you click a link on instagram that takes you there, you will end up going in through the app, so the website will be open in Instagram, and that is a very bad UX. As all people have told me until now, I should create an app. Maybe it is time for me to work in it using react native, so that more and more people can have it installed in their phone. For it to be the place where they go and listen to music when there is nothing else. A true social media built around the sharing of amazing music. From random people. Crazy people from all around the world just sharing the music. Yes. There is nothing more important that I could create than this platform, so I will give it a bit more time.

So here I am, running around the maze again. Wondering and wondering about what this whole game is about. Yes. Yesterday there was a moment of realization that came to me related to what this is. It is the integration that I never had, for all of the experiences that I have gone through in my life. I have done so many different things, exploring in so many different realms, that I’m lost. There is too much inside me that needs to be integrated. That needs to be transformed into something powerful that makes me feel alive. And actually writing makes me feel alive. Creating makes me feel alive. Interacting with people makes me feel alive, because it is the means by which I’m able to condense everything that I have gone through into an exploration of the present moment. Yes. If I had to summarize the most important aspect of this whole manifesto it is creativity. It is that necessity of building up something that didn’t exist before, and more than building it, just exploring what comes up. That is the exploration. Witnessing what comes up.

--

Being, just being. Just walking through the forest with the intention of experiencing what that moment brings. Writing, just writing. With the sole intention of bringing up the words that will end up making sentences. Breathing. Just breathing. With the sole intention to explore a little bit more into the wonders of life. Eating. Just eating. With the sole intention of feeling all the pleasure that is unleashed as each bite comes into the mouth. Wondering. Just wondering. What it feels to live a million lives. What it feels to be the other person. Caring. Just caring. To give a little bit more of what was given before. Loving. Just loving. Everything that is, as it is. Experiencing. Just experiencing. What every moment brings. The mystery of it all. Playing. Just playing. Inviting that inner child to shine through every one of my actions. Laughing. Just laughing. At the curiosity that is sparked by the laughter that comes from deep within. Becoming free. Just becoming free. From everything that should be in a particular way, and opening up to just what is.

What is now is everything that will ever be.

--

The act of creation is complete, as it unfolds in every moment, in every circumstance. It is as complete as it will always be, and in that sole recognition there is magic. The magic that comes from knowing that everything is right where it should be. Everything is complete, right here, right now, as I write these words, and as you read them. This moment is being in two different moments at the same time, and it will be there forever. What is present now will be present forever, and the impact that I make in the world by making it existent is everything that is. Everything that will ever be. I don’t need any more knowledge, I just need the doing. I don’t need to be part of more courses or groups or stuff, everything is out there for me to go and look for it. I just need to surround myself with the people that care enough for do their thing, and that is the way forward in this moment of history. Being able to discover who are the ones that matter, and connect with them from the heart. That is what is going to make the difference, that is what is going to open up the doors for a new understanding of how we relate to each other. It is time for me to free up the doors of wanting to do something different from what I’m doing, and to fully embody it. Fully transform myself into the act of creation that is being unfolded with each letter that I write. I don’t need to be anything different from what I am right now to do this. I don’t need the attention from the external world, because that would mean that in even in a small aspect I would be doing what I do to please someone. And I don’t want to create from that place. I just want to create from a place of truth, from a place of wanting to explore what already is, and be able to create something so valuable that people will afterwards share it with each other. That is the only measure of success, if I’m able to build something so valuable that it will actually be helpful for people, not just noise in their social media feed. That is a kind of noise that I don’t want, that is not helpful for me, and I don’t want it.

What I’m doing here is an exploration into the long term, and it is very important for me to have that in mind as I sit down to Do The Work, every day. This manifesto that I’m writing is the foundation over which all my work will be built. Everything that I bring into the world will be in line with what will be written here, and it is time for me to realize that in order for that to be as solid as it can be I need to be able to put all my energy and heart into it. And that means taking care of myself in every aspect, so that I can show up. And if I don’t do it, it is perfect it is part of what needs to be acknowledged. There are no shoulds. This manifesto is the end of shoulds. It is time to wake up to how the world is and how it works, by opening up to be part of the flow of life. Be the best guest in this whole journey of discovery of consciousness by witnessing those amazing things that human beings have done until now. I know how to do it, and I know how to succeed. I have what it takes. And the biggest success of them all is just coming here and realizing that everything is perfect as it is. It is realizing that I’m already complete, and that I have already opened enough to the world. Patience, that everything will take its correct place soon. Patience is the biggest gift of them all, because it is what craftmanship is all about. Cultivate patience my friend. Step by step. Drop by drop. The drip work does its thing. If you show up, the world will answer back. I’m already showing up, it is time to acknowledge that and embrace it and live from that knowing, that I’m doing my best, in every moment. That is all what it takes. To be the best version of yourself that you can. Right here, right now.
