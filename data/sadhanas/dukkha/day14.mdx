There was a slight tentation to go to another place and start checking social media, or my email, or whatever that was different from coming here just to write. I just ended my morning meditation and there has been a feeling inside as if I was dirty, impure, just because yesterday I smoked weed (a lot) and today I was not able to wake up early to do the stuff that I usually do in the morning. That has me here starting to write at this time, instead of before the sunrise. So many things come to me related to this circumstance… My relationship with substances (mainly alcohol, weed and sugar), and the boundaries of discipline.

During the last two years I have been dancing very often with the ‘this is the last time I do X’. And X mainly has been about those 3 substances. It has been very hard for me to be consistent with that willingness to have them outside my life, because they often make that noise in there related to them being necessary. And I don’t have complete clarity related to why they are important. What is the thing about them that has them inside my consciousness making this noise still. Writing this is my exploration into walking towards and integration of that, so that I can eventually move on.

Why do I keep falling into that pattern? Yesterday we began our first family project in a long time, and we started preparing the soil to plant the first vegetables in our garden. It was a lovely moment, and it is very exciting to start doing something like this. Even our little daughter was there, helping us taking out the soil with her small little hands. But there was this noise inside me that that moment could have been enhanced by smoking weed, because it was such a ‘mundane’ moment that smoking would have made it good. And yes, it brought a lot of things, good ideas and stuff, but the thing is that because of smoking I tend to avoid experiencing certain feelings and sensations in my body and consciousness, because I am actually in an altered state of consciousness. For example, afterwards I tweeted something that was very important, tagging an important account, and I don’t recall feeling very nervous about it. And usually I would have felt very nervous, and that is information for me to move on and integrate what I have inside. It is important to face the fact that I feel nervous. And yesterday it was not there, because of being high. But the intersting part is that today it was there, and having done what I did actually brought interesting stuff today. As I write, it is all present, and what I’m realizing now is that it doesn’t serve any purpose to fight with it. It is important for me to acknowledge why I do stuff, and be conscious every time that I’m doing them which is the purpose of it.

When I smoke week, ask myself: Am I avoiding something with this?
When I drink alcohol, ask myself: Am I avoiding something with this?

Asking these questions will help me clarify my relationship with the particular substance, and with that, make peace with the fact that I used because of that purpose. It doesn’t do any good to me to be blaming myself for having done something that is not good for me in this moment of life. Who knows? I spent a big chunk of my life drinking as if the world was going to end. Is it good for me to say that it didn’t serve any purpose in my life? I was truly having a great time, I was truly having fun and enjoying every second of it. Now I look back and of course that I would have done it differently because the amount of neurons that I killed is ridiculous, it was too much, but it did serve a purpose. And if it didn’t, it doesn’t matter, because it is the reality of the things that already happened. The whole practice is being equanimous with that, and accepting it.

That was something that was present today in my practice of meditation, as I was going through this small inside blaming for having smoked yesterday. I was telling myself: You already did it, its part of reality, and just have in mind this for the next time so that you an make a more informed decision about what you are going to do. Are you willing to sacrifice the energy that you have when you wake up early for being high working on the garden? Are you willing to give up a good night sleep for being high a bit? Are you willing to give up part of your memory? (I d0n’t think I remember everything that happened).

Yea, so the thing about this stimulants and mind altering substances is that they take me out of my center. Am I moving towards a state of not taking anything and just being a samurai with what I do, full focused? What does that bring? How does that speak about myself? The thing is that I have inside this structure of thought related to being rigid not being good. It is what society has told me, and my mind always plays the trick of saying to me: It’s just once a week, it’s ok. But what is the prize that I end up paying for that one time? Is it worth it? And that is the question that I have to ask myself with every substance that I decide to take consciously, responsibly and having the question in mind: Is this helping me? Why am I doing this?

I absolutely see that it is hard for me to ask this question to myself. But I’m moving towards there, it is part of this process of transformation. It is the same that when in meditation I go into a stream of thought, and then I remember that I was meditating and come back. In the world of addictions, I go towards one, and then a few hours later I remember where I was, I feel a little bad about having done the thing, and then I come back. It’s that eternal game. And I also say that it is the last time I’m going to do it.

I guess that the important thing to have in mind here is related to the effect that they have in my capacity of Doing The Work. I guess it is related to the importance that I give to The Work, and to every moment in my life. Because it happens to me that sometimes I smoke weed because I will be in a place where the people will be too boring for me to be there. Or I drink alcohol because it is the only way to have fun and resonate in the frequency of those who will be there. But what am I avoiding with that? Where do I want to get with it? I’m inside a loop, because for example if I’m going to a concert there is always this noise inside me that I should smoke weed to have fun in it. To enjoy the music deeply. Is that the truth? Do I really need it? That circumstance that I’m going to experience is unique: Do I truly want to experience it through the filter of having taken something external to enjoy it purely or do I want to go through it with all of who I am in that moment, without external stuff? I want to move towards the latter, because there is a deep need inside me of not needing something particular to enjoy reality completely. It is part of all the work that I have been doing, and it is a very important part to acknowledge what I have said here.

The mind is blurry today, it seems like everything that has been written is just noise. It is just me trying to fit into a particular way of doing things, into a particular set of limitations. It is just what it is, I already did it and it is good to acknowledge and move on. Come on, just move on and live this moment without that blaming of things to have been different. You did it, you enjoyed it, and it is good like that.

That brings me to the other point, the one of discipline. What is what comes out for me in an experience like this? Having gone ‘out of track’, letting the discipline free and coming back to work with these sensations inside? I guess that the question is always: Is it worth it? Because of course the weed brings good and nice sensations into the system, and it is cool to do it, but how is that coolness compared to the feelings that come when I realize that I was able to show up and do the work, consistently and motivated?

The kind of feeling that shows up as a consequence of discipline is much deeper than the one that is associated with these kinds of habits, that eventually bring this negative feelings inside. I have fun, I enjoy, but then I feel bad. Do I want to keep feeling bad? Is it worth it? Probably not, so it is time for me to accept that and have it in mind the next time that I decide to do something that alters my consciousness. And not that really, but something that alters my schedule and what I have kind of optimized for me to work good. Eating is a great example of this also. I already know that if I eat in the night I feel horrible until the next morning, so each time that I decide consciously to eat in the night I’m opening the window to these sensations to arise. I need to be responsible for them, because they are part of the reality of what I am experiencing.

But the most important window that I need to open is the one of the understanding of how I feel in the moment on which I’m thinking about doing the stuff. Next time that I think about smoking weed in a particular situation, take a long moment to think about that situation and ask myself: Am I experiencing this moment from a place of division that I think will be closed up by doing this? That is what is present in me when I drink alcohol. There is a division between me and my experience of what is happening. I feel that drinking will close the gap between my consciousness and the one of the people that are there. It will create a buffer that will help us communicate in the same frequency. It will bring us together, because there is some division in there.

And that is the big fallacy that it is important for me to address. That is the information that I need so that I can make the progress that I need to make with what I’m doing. Because that information is gold. That feeling of division is the key to all what has been experienced by me as a human being. How did I feel when I went to a party and I was sober? What was present in me? How am I dealing with that in this moment of my life? This are all questions that arise from the fact of having done something like this, and I repeat: The important part is just having them in mind. Every time that I decide consciously to do something, feel it in myself. Is there any division present? How is that division talking to me about who I am?

And with that information move on. Go within. Those are the windows within that I have not completely explored yet, because probably they are the ones that are harder for me to navigate. Boredom is very hard for me to navigate. The doing of repetitive stuff, the being with people that I don’t resonate, etc. Those are things that speak to me about this feelings of division, and it will be important for me to address those so that I can better know myself.

And how does all this story relate to Dukkha? Because this project is a journey into a deeper understanding of the self, and what I have talked about are key components of our modern society that help us evade the feelings that are present because of the circumstances of our life. Each TJ in Dukkha will consist of a bunch of people going through a particular journey, and it is not good to limit what they can or can’t do in their life, it is just part of what they decide to do, but the good thing will be to have in mind what I have talked about here and give them the understanding that it is important to be a witness of the decisions that they make, and what they are talking to them about who they are. About their relationship with themselves. And the important thing about it is not to be a bully and say that something is right or wrong. No one will judge anyone because of having gone into a particular behavior. It is part of the game. The important part will be to create the means for them to integrate that experience in a way that is conducent to the evolution that we are aiming to create in the individual, so that each person is able to be conscious about their actions in the truest sense. A lot of this patterns of action are unconscious, and as they are made conscious there is a big release of energy and a sense of freedom that is good. It is a step by step process, but we will all be there for each other. That is the nice thing.

It’s crazy to open the internet to play some music and end up doing a completely different thing. It was a short moment, but the amount of information in there is absolutely overwhelming. Our brains are fried!

Ok, so back to how this whole thing that I have been talking about addictions helps in Dukkha. I still haven’t resolved the issue of addictions in my way of thinking, because probably if you asked a person that deals with alcoholics about his relationship with alcohol, he would say that the way to go is to not use it at all. It is as if a window would open, and there would be a going back to that old pattern. Does that mean that the pattern is healed in any way? I truly don’t think so, because there is always this avoidance of just staring at the relationship with the substance, and integrate the role that it has played in the life of the individual. If there is a person that hasn’t drunk in 16 years and suddenly he drinks and becomes an alcoholic again… Does that mean that those whole 16 years he was deceiving himself? And in those 16 years, what is the role that alcohol has played in his life? I’m talking from an unconscious level here: What does the restriction that comes from actively avoiding something that you are addicted to bring into your life? I wonder, because I think that there is something there that is not resolved. For example this week I told myself that I would not drink for one year. Is that helping me to better understand my relationship with alcohol? Or the fact that I decide to drink again and face the feelings that I am facing in this moment (caused by weed, but they are similar) teaches me more about it and actually moves me toward a state of ‘healing’ because I’m actually dealing with the thing?

I don’t have a clue related to this question, and perhaps it is because I have never truly dealt with an addict in my life. I don’t completely know what it is like. I was very, very good at drinking, but I would not say I’m addicted to alcohol because I don’t have any problem to not drink. But that is only my experience. It doesn’t work for others.

How will we deal in Dukkha with people that have addictions?

A big part of me tells me that I need to have a better understanding of this whole thing, but that part is the one that wants to create a conceptual frame of reference from which to evaluate situations. It is not the part that wants to free himself from suffering so that he can become a mirror for the experience of other human beings. Because each of us is a unique individual, each one with his own limitations, challenges and experiences, and if I have a conceptual understanding of this thing I will tend to ‘frame’ people more. I will tend to bring them into a particular basket, and with that, separate myself from the experience of just being for them. I think that wanting to better know this subject is me trying to control, trying to help, when what is needed is for people to be able to help themselves. I just need to provide the means for that to happen, and those means are my absolute and complete presence for their experience. Just being there for them. Not help them understand what they are going through, there are people that are better than me for that, but just being there for them and listening to what they have to say, so that they can get their own conclusions and they can go through their own healing because of that. That is the game that I will understand how to play. That is the one that makes more sense to me. It is not that I’m lazy and I don’t want to study the stuff that will help me understand, it is maybe that I don’t want to understand. I just want to experience.

Right now, I don’t have a conceptual understanding of why I decided to smoke weed yesterday, or eat sugar on Tuesday, or drink ‘my last beer’. Do I need it? I don’t think so. What I need is just to feel what I’m feeling, and go through it from my own lens. To be a witness of myself, and from that process develop a deeper relationship with the circumstances of my life. With my relationship with life. Only through that I will be able to evolve. Because if I fit myself into a particular label, for example that ‘I don’t drink alcohol’, I will be inhabiting from this perspective of separation, of division. There is a sense inside me that there is division present on categorizing me as a person that doesn’t drink alcohol, because I shut myself from the experience of drinking alcohol if I feel like. And I don’t want to limit my experience as a human being, I just want to open it up and let it it. Whatever it brings. As I was meditating today I had this image of the punisher god that was telling me that what I did was wrong, that I should not have done it. And there was the shoulding again. You shouldn’t do this, you shouldn’t do that. Who knows… The only reality is that I did it, and the only reality is that it is part of my existence right now and food for what I will do tomorrow. That is all that matters, and I watch it with compassion towards myself, and from there move on.

That is what I want to bring into Dukkha, this understanding of compassion towards the self more than everything. You will make mistakes, you will miss Doing The Work, you will do something that you ‘shouldn’t’ do, and it is ok. The important piece is just being conscious of it, and move on with the understanding that it brought. That is to play the game, that is to move towards being free. Freedom is opening every window in the human experience, and making the conscious decision of going through the one that feels good for you. Without looking behind, just realizing that each moment is a new opportunity. Each moment is a new window to look deeper within yourself, and through that process, get to know you better. That is the most that you can do, and I can’t do it for you. You have to go in there by yourself. You have to face that blaming, those afterthoughts that you ‘shouldn’t’, etc. You are the one that has that voice inside, and I just want to invite you to be a witness of that voice and ask yourself: Who is the one that is blaming? Who is the one that feels bad? Who is the one that made that decision that now is being regretted? And from that inquiry go deeper, closer (in)to the truth.

The only way in is through.

That is what is being shown in this moment, in this blurry moment when there is not clarity of all the thing. And probably there is not clarity because there is still this feeling of division, of wanting for stuff to be different. But I’m moving a little bit towards the healing of that division, and it feels good.

It’s crazy to have spent all this time debating with myself about the consequences of having smoked weed yesterday. Sometimes I can be hard with myself, and that’s why having a community of people that are going through the shit is helpful. If Dukkha already existed and there was a group of people in there going through a TJ, we could talk to each other, and help each other in this journey into compassion.

It is about having all this people around just to remind you that you have to go through your shit on your own. At the end of the day, it is just you with yourself. You are the one that has to show up, Do The Work and integrate whatever shit is going on. In my case, it is this eternal dance with my addictions and things that are very hard for me to give up, and in your case it may be something completely different. Just acknowledge it, and embrace it, and move on with that understanding. Always be willing to dive a bit deeper so that you can grow from each thing that happens in your life. If it is a shouldn’t or not. It doesn’t matter. They are all information that can remind you about the infinite aspect of life. About the eternal mystery of why we are here. That is the game. That is the amazing game.

And which is the role that a psychology could play in this whole process? To help that information to be brought up, so that you can better deal with it after it has surfaced. I don’t know. Maybe I’m just running in circles in here, but it is just what it is. I won’t judge myself. And the question in the background runs: And how does this relate to Dukkha? Remember that this whole thing is the manifesto of the DAO. And I can’t even write down the manifesto, because I truly don’t know what I’m writing about. It seems to be just noise, but it is the noise that is coming from the purity of my experience. My goal in this place, with these writings, is to be as sincere as I can be so that I can share everything that I’m going through in this process. The manifesto is just that, a translation of my experience of bringing the shit out of the unconscious so that I can process it and with that become more human. More animal. I can’t outline anything that is outside my experience, because I’m kind of closed to that. In this process and in this moment of my life, I’m just taking care of dealing with what is going on through me. It is very intense like this, so I’m good with it. I can’t speak about the experience of other people, and I won’t to it. I’m just here for myself, sharing what is going on with me, so that you, when you read this, realize that you are not the only one that is crazy. I’m crazy too. And I embrace it. I hope that you embrace it also because it is the only way on which you are going to be able to evolve. To go through this whole process, accepting everything that you have been and everything that you are.

How does this whole thing relate to Dukkha? Because it speaks about my transparency. I’m not coming here to pretend to be something I’m not, I’m coming here to be everything that I am. And what is present in my experience right now is all what I have shared here, and I love it as it is. I share it with you just for you to know. Or just for me to know. Just for me to process it, and with that, move forward. Move into a new relationship with those things that make noise inside me, that won’t let me see with the clarity that I need. Yesterday I sent messages that may be embarrassing, but they were talked from my heart. I’m relating to life with my heart in here.

Yesterday we had an episode with my partner on which I realized that I had made a mistake, and I was able to tell her about having made a mistake sooner than before. How great is that feeling of having realized that you did something wrong, and actually be able to say: I’m sorry. I made a mistake. How great is that feeling and how often we avoid feeling it because of not being willing to give up our pride. What does open in a relationship between human beings when there is one that is willing to say I’m sorry, I made a mistake? And what does that bring into the communication, into the flow between each of them? It was a magical moment really, because I could feel how her defenses were being lowered. It ended up with a hug, and we moved on. This is a new example of realizing the stuff in the moment that it is experienced, and how this whole process of presence is that, just a process. Just moving step by step into a deeper understanding of myself so that I can realize earlier why I’m doing what I’m doing, and what it is bringing into my experience of life. That’s the journey, each day move towards a better understanding of how I life and what is present in me when I decide to do what I do. That understanding is the one that brings true freedom, because it lets me choose from a place of awareness, from a place of being conscious. Being responsible. Standing strong and building from there.

Something important that came through yesterday was related to a question that was asked by What I’ve Learned in YouTube:
Do you think the Buddhist concept of Enlightenment / Awakening is real?

The interesting part of it is that the first answer to the poll was this one: Yes, and anyone with enough extra time can achieve it.

When I read it I felt a weird feeling inside, as if I had been attacked, because of what I have done and where I have gotten in the understanding of this thing. I hate to say the understanding because that comes from the level of mind and I don’t want this thing to come from the level of mind because that I know that the way to make ‘progress’ is to experience from a different place but anyway, no way out of it right now. So yes. I have enough time because life has given me the opportunity to explore, so of course that I am one of the ones that thinks that yes, it exists. But then I was thinking about my grandparent, and my great-grandparent, and realizing: They were very curious people, and probably if they had known that something like this was a possibility, they would have gone through the process of going deeper into its discovery. How would any curious person not want to know more about this if it is the ultimate realization that one can have in a lifetime? Realizing your own being is just it, there is nothing at the other side, and what comes from it is absolute freedom. Why wouldn’t you want to know the truth?

And probably they would have liked to, who knows, and it was not a matter of time or money or energy. It was because of the society in which they lived, and the access of information that was available to them. Something like this was not accessible to people because there was a lot of noise between them and the concept of awakening. But now, with all the information that we have, we can realize that this is a thing, and help each other in the quest of this realization… Of truth. It is the greatest mystery of our lifetime, the greatest mystery of life itself, and as we transition into the new stage of our species this is the major shift that is going to happen. This is how we evolve, and finally we are heading towards that evolution. The veil of the dream is beginning to be lifted, and what lies at the other side is profoundly mysterious.

Doors that are being opened, people that are starting to become curious. This is just starting.

The question that goes through the mind right now is: What is the purpose of this manifesto? It is just an exploration into what is alive as I go through this process of discovering the truth. I just come here and vomit what is present. There is not an underlying agenda because I don’t truly know where this is heading, and I don’t really care. I just show up for those that will come, for those that want to experience the same thing in their own flesh. It is not about the ones that will read, it is just about myself being myself. Just letting me be, with the witness of consciousness in front.
