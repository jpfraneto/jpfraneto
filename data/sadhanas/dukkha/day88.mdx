I still haven’t been able to wake up. I could suppose that after all this hard work that I have done in the last months and years, it would have already happened, but here I am, trying to change something. Or more than that, trying to accept the fact that there is nothing to change, but from the perspective of someone that wants things to change from the depth of his heart. But maybe I’m not quite ready yet. I’ve been pushing myself towards this new way of existing as a human being, trying to ‘get it', with everything that I have, but maybe it is just not my time. And accepting that and embracing it is quite a humbling experience, and I’m just here to bow towards life and express my gratitude. That’s the thing. I want to honor every moment of my life, and every moment of the existence that has been, which has me right now writing this piece and listening to Mahler’s symphony number 5. Yesterday I went to a park to listen to a live show of a symphony from Mozart, I think it was the first time that I watched classical music live, and in one moment it was very powerful. I closed my eyes and transported myself to the moment on which he was writing that symphony. I wondered which was the state of being on which he was experiencing life right in that moment. I wonder which is the state of flow that was present as an interface of him with reality. It fills me with wonder, and because of that, I can realize that everything that I have done is in the pursuit of living like this. I truly want to put all of what I am into what I do. I want to have that capacity. I want to live life at its fullest, get the most out of it, and there is no other way on which I think I will be able to do it than if I wake up. If I’m able to experience this whole thing from the perspective of abiding non dual awareness.

And that’s the rabbit hole that I’m in right now. It is very hard for me to get out there, and to have a different way of exploring what is present. I just feel that my head is on fire, and that the pond where I will be able to make it transform into something different, into a relief, is this path of waking up. That’s why I’m so kind of desperate with it, because there is something going on inside me that I don’t understand, and I’m quite tired of it. I don’t want to fight it anymore, I try my best to let it be and just observe what is going on, but it is a lot, you know? And that’s what comes now, all this willingness to wake up, always with an underlying necessity of helping the world in some way. I feel that I owe life something because of everything that it has given to me, and that makes me believe that the thing that I have to do is to give back. So there is always this transactional relationship from me towards the practice and the consequences of it, with me creating what I’m creating with the hope that I will be accepted. That I will be forgiven. It is always present that pattern of behavior of trying to be accepted. In all my relationships, and now I can realize that it is also present in my approach to Doing The Work. I want to be seen. I need to be seen. I’m desperate for being seen, for having someone that tells me if what I’m doing is right or wrong. But there won’t be anyone like that. It doesn’t work like that. At least in my life, it doesn’t. What works is just calibrating the inner compass, and being able to be present with what comes with whatever I do.

That’s the thing, I write about this abiding non dual awareness and then I go to my life and start acting in it from a place of lack of awareness of the present moment, I forget about it. I forget to just be. I enter this maze of thinking, of wanting to have answers, of trying to understand, and everything goes to a place different from the one that is natural. The one that feels free. I just want to be free. I just want to be able to express every aspect of my being through my actions without the mediation of the thinking mind. I just want to have my mind as the tool with which I interface with reality, but I’m tired of it governing the show. It is ruthless. It is exhausting. No matter what I do, no matter where I put myself in, that little voice is always in there making noise. Telling me that it won’t leave me alone. And that’s the character that I have built inside me of it, but I truly can’t become free of it. I remember an experience the last year on which I took 6 grams of psylocibin mushrooms and I was in the middle of the experience and there it was, wounded but present. Picture in your mind the following image: A box ring which contains my whole experience of reality, and on the corner of it my mind, having had its butt kicked and being really damaged in its capacity of being the commander, but nevertheless there, raising its flag and always saying to me “Here I am. Here I will always be. You’ll never be alone”. And the worst part of it are those moments on which I enter altered states of consciousness (especially lately through breathwork practices) and I know that I’m going there and there is the mind with its incessant voice saying: “This is it! This is the moment on which I wake up. Buckle up and prepare.” I am so incredibly identified with the necessity of waking up that I can’t be free of it. I can’t stop thinking about it as a concept, and that brings more of the trap of the mind to exist. Every concept that can be conceived, every separation that can be manifested in the realm of mind is just that, mind doing its thing. Every moment on which I try to understand something it is part of the same game. Every moment on which I remember that the voice is inside is just a new adventure into the patience that it takes to realize that it won’t leave me alone. It is exhausting. And I have been coming here all this time in a quest for becoming free from it. Of acknowledging and experiencing and embodying the fact that I’m not it. But I have not been successful. Here I am, experiencing my life through the perspective that I have always been. Here I am, looking at this computer from the eyes that have been with me all this time, feeling the touch of each keystroke with the same fingers that have been with me all this time, smelling the pollution of the big city, hearing this symphony. It is all just part of the infinite array of experiences that inform my little corner of awareness in this infinite existence. The existence that I know is something more than what I’m perceiving at the moment, and that I’m desperately trying to get out from.

So yes, I’m more trapped in the maze than ever. And there is in me an incredible willingness to get out, but there is also a lack of understanding of how to do it. Which is the next step? This is the last day of me writing this book. At the beginning, it was supposed to be the story of an alien that comes to the earth to be the witness of the process of awakening of a species. It eventually ended up being all this thing that I have been writing all this time, which doesn’t make too much sense, which is just a random stream of consciousness that ends up being a lot of noise. Or maybe not. I don’t know, I haven’t even been able to read it. It’s just too much. This whole thing is just too much. I’m tired of it. It is brutal, to know that there is something at the other side and push all my effort so that I can get there and realizing that the one that is doing the effort is the one that needs to give up. But when I tell myself that it is time to give up I end up falling in the trap of telling myself: “Ok, this is it! I gave up so now I’m going to wake up”. And I run round and round in that circle. Wanting to become enlightened. Wanting to become more of myself. Is this who I am? The one that struggles and fights with what is and just ruminates through this whole thing instead of just shutting down and enjoying what is in front of me?

I wish it was as easy as that. There is a fundamental aspect of myself that is not at peace with what is going on, and that’s where this craving for waking up comes from. My whole experience of life is mediated by the fact that it is never enough. That nothing is ever enough. No matter which experience I’m living, for me to become free from all the expectations of it being different is something impossible. At least for now. Or maybe that’s the thing, because I’m trying to experience what I’m experiencing from the perspective of a ‘me’. I am the one that wants to cease to have expectation, so the question that comes right away is: “Who is that I?”. Who is the one that is putting all this effort into waking up? What does inform the experience of reality of the one that answers that question.

I have been saying these last weeks that I’m being done a cosmic surgery right now. All the sensations that are happening through my system can only be explained by that, and I’m just accepting it and embracing it with love and equanimity. But where is it heading to? I want to believe with all my heart that it is going to help me become free. But that is a huge expectation that I need to become free from so that it can truly be the means by which I become free. It is only by giving up the tendency that I have for fighting through stuff with the intention to get something out of it that I’m going to move towards where I want to move. But it is an incredible paradox. I don’t have any clue about how to do this. I truly can’t do it. I have been all this time writing this thing and trying to figure out how to do it and it just seems to be impossible. And that’s because I’m trying to figure it out. I’m thinking through it. I’m trying to make my way through by reasoning, by giving energy to the thoughts that inform the way on which ‘it should be’. And there lies the problem. In that mighty word. I feel that it had been hidden the last days, waiting for its stellar appearance in this last moment. It was on the outside of the ring waiting to come in to fight once more. “Here I am. This is what you should be doing to become enlightened”. That’s the game that is being played inside me right now. This is how crazy I am. And it’s just natural to acknowledge it, and love it, because it is just who I am. Right here, right now. Every word that is coming through is just an exploration into that reality, into the incredible fact that I’m this level of crazy. Should it be different? Let’s give a little attention to that mighty word. At the end of the day, it is the one that has us here. In my eyes, it is the creator of this experience that I’m having right now.

Should. What an incredible word. What a powerful word. In the language on which I dream, I would say ‘debería’. ‘Deberías hacer esto’. ‘Deberías haber hecho esto otro’. Always running around as those aspects of myself that have not been integrated. Always jumping on stage when I least expect it. Always being there, giving energy to the need for the present moment to be different. From all the words that have been spoken or written through me, this is today the most important one. The one that gives me more information about myself. Each time that I use it, it is an invitation for me to realize where I’m positioning myself in relationship with what is going on right now. I don’t have an absolute and complete understanding of it, but what comes is that it is always related to the need of life being different from what is. From the need of experiencing it in a different way. In a way that feels lighter. More aligned. But it is there, negating what is so that it can build in the mind an image of how it could be different. And that’s the thing that makes me go crazy. That craving, that need, that existential necessity for things to be different. No matter what I do in my life, it could always be better. It could always be something that can be more helpful, useful, transformative, whatever. But it never is ok as it is. And that is the biggest burden that I live with. It is exhausting. No matter what I do, it is never enough. So I guess that this writing is just a calling for help. I need help. I’m done with this. I’m ready. I have done my best, I have pushed through with everything that I have, and I’m done. And you want to know something that I consider very funny? As I write those words, that little voice in my head is somewhere around there, and I can hear its voice pushing me and saying: “Yes! That’s the way, surrender the seeker, that is how you’ll become enlightened! That’s the progress that you need to make!”. It will never leave me alone. No matter what I do, the “closer” I get to this thing the more powerful the voice becomes, telling me what to do in order that I can move towards the goal that I’m striving for. The one that my soul is craving for.

So yes, I guess that this whole book was that. An exploration into how my mind speaks about my whole experience as a human being. It was supposed to be called ‘The End Of Shoulds’, but it never was something like that. It was just a deeper exploration into a world of shoulds, into a world where everything need to be changed, to be perfected, to be expressed in a new way. A world where everything is fundamentally wrong, and there is a possibility of making it better. But that possibility entails becoming free, going out of the maze, and it is just impossible. It feels that with each word that is said the maze gets taller and taller and taller. So should I stop writing? Is that the way out? That’s the mind, being very audacious in the quest of finding that way out. That’s the mind, with all its willingness to be free of itself.

It doesn’t make any sense. How can the mind become free from the mind. If the notion that I have of who “I” am is just the interface by which I have been experiencing life all this time, how can I become free of it from the perspective of itself? It is as if a tree wanted to stop being a tree. It just can’t. Mind can’t stop being identified with mind. It is mind. It is just that in my experience as a human being awareness is contained in this mind. And I know rationally that my true self is just awareness, so I am here trying to pop the balloon of my own mind with every needle that I end up having access to, just to realize that the balloon is invisible and I can’t touch it. Awareness is contained within that balloon, and there is no way out of it that I can’t think of. And that’s the thing. I’m trying to think that way out. Thinking comes from the experience of mind. It is a consequence of mind. So to become free of it I don’t have to think my way through, I just have to be my way through. The only way in is through. I just need to experience my absolute beingness through myself, using my life as the exploration playground, so that from there I can just experience what is. In front of me. I want to wake up and just become free from the incessant necessity of being focused in a moment different from the one that is happening in front of my nose, but I don’t realize that the way for doing that is just being. It is just exploring how it feels not to think. Feeling how it feels. That’s the thing, that’s the practice. Forgetting everything that I have been taught, every thought that has come through my mind, any concept related to what this game is, and just allowing myself to experience it completely.

To dive into the game with everything that I have. And that is also part of what has me here, right now, writing these words to you. I’m here exploring how to be the most present that I can in my experience of life through each and every one of these words. Each one of them is an exploration, an invitation, into what just is. I’m just being right now. And there goes the little voice telling me. “Nope! Here I am. This should be different. There should be an openness in your body that is not there right now. You are not doing it correctly”. That’s my boss, being my boss. Telling me what to do. I’m absolutely tired of this boss, and I don’t know how to fire myself. I don’t know how to give up my relationship with my boss and integrate it in a way that makes me feel good. Do I feel bad? I don’t really know. I just feel. And it is ok. (That came from my mind also).

--

I’m going to place myself in the perspective of something that I think is highly improbable, but I just want to explore as an invitation to play. At the end, I just want to play. Everything that I do is an invitation to play, I just can’t see it with clarity yet, because of all this necessity that I have for being serious and allowing others to realize how intelligent and serious, and committed to Do The Work and everything that I can say so that I can feel good about what I do. So yes, I’m here to play. And the game that I will play right now is the one that pictures a future on which there is another person reading these words. In some way, resonating with what is being said. Or judging it. Or whatever. But if you made it until here, it is because there is something in this craziness that calls your attention. I don’t know what it may be, but I just want to invite you to observe that.

Can you take a deep breath and tell you how does it feel in your body?

How does it feel to be you?

When you read that word, who is the one that is identified with it? Who is the you that you are referring to when you experience what that word brings to awareness through the vehicle of your senses?

Ask yourself those questions until there is no one answering. Until the truth comes forth.

Those are the stories that I tell myself in a way to make sense of what is happening. The one that goes around is that by prompting people with those inquiries I’m going to help them become more of themselves, by realizing who they are not. But these are all things that I have listened before, and that don’t make too much sense to me when I say them. There is an aspect of myself that feels like a deep imposter and that judges me for repeating those words like a parrot, as if they were the means by which other people would wake up. As if it was what was needed to say right now. So again I’m judging myself, telling me what shoul be different. This is the end of shoulds, you know? It is time to remember.

That everything that is is perfect at it is, and it is following the route of what needs to be manifested in order for evolution to take place. I’m bringing myself into routes that I don’t know here. All those aspects that judge inside are the ones that tell me that there is something that should be done differently. That there is a way of doing things that makes more sense than others. That’s just the mind, doing its eternal thing. Hello mind, welcome back. I call it jorgito. Hello jorgito. It’s nice to remember that you were here. So yes, the aspects that judge me because I’m talking about evolution are not helpful for exploring the unknown, so now is the time on which I leave them back and just throw into the void what is present, right here, right now. Every aspect of myself tells me that humanity is going through a process of evolution, and that one of the sentences that I have heard throughout my life that makes more sense is ‘as above so below’. I say that humanity is going through a process of evolution, but what makes more sense is to just narrow that towards my own experience. I think that a lot of problems could be solved or at least worked on more efficiently if I just started talking about myself instead of generalizing. So I’m trying to do that. So yes, I’m going through a process of evolution that has me with all these crazy things inside. That has me writing this book, and trying to find the way out of the maze. This process of evolution has as a consequence the golden gem of abiding non dual awareness that I have been writing about and pointing myself towards this whole time, at least that is the story that I tell myself. I’m evolving so that my perspective of awareness is shifted from the person to the whole. That’s what my rationality tells me, but who knows. I’m more lost than ever. But what I can say with certainty is that it is a brutal road. And that I’m here to learn how to make it easier. Because the worlds needs it. I don’t want to place in myself the mystical superhero cape (I think that is the word), but it is just the calling that I have inside, you know? I don’t want to overdeliver myself and say that I’m something special, I just want to acknowledge all the work that I have done in order to become more conscious and aware of what life truly is. All this book that I have written is an invitation into that void. Into the not knowing. Into the experience of just being. From the depth of my heart, there is an infinite need for each human being to thrive, for each of us to be at peace with our own and unique story. There is a need for beauty to arise from each creation that we can come up with. We are an amazing species, full of wonder, full of curiosity, full of joy, full of creativity, full of love. It is just that we have forgotten it.

See? Where does that writing place you and me? In a place of separation. I don’t want to speak for the whole of humanity, it doesn’t make sense anymore. Big changes happen step by step, person by person, and it is here that I just want to talk directly to you. Whoever you are. However you feel identified with what shows up in your experience when you are referred as ‘you’.

I know you. I am you. The fundamental building block that ends up being who you are is the same as the one that is inside me. Around me. Everywhere. I know this. Not from my own experience, but every cell of my body vibrates in the resonance of that as the truth. You are evolving. I am evolving. You are entering a new phase of existence, one which will be mediated by the necessity of expressing your own and unique truth in this world. Everything that constitutes who you are is pure potential, an eternal willingness to manifest, to express, that is present in every aspect of your being. It is time for you to open up to that, and allow it to be. Allow it to be manifested through you. We came here to create beauty, to come to being, and it is time to open up the door for that to be. All this writing started as an intention to clarify what was going on inside me so that I could understanding, and now I realize that I will never understanding. It is not something to be understood. It is something to be experienced. Day after day, moment after moment. And the most important message that I want to leave you with is: You are not alone. Everything that you are ever going through, just have in mind: You are not alone. I’m here with you, with everything that I have, to hold your hand through this process of evolution so that we can navigate it together. We are heading to uncharted waters, my heart tells me that it will be the most incredible journey of our existence, but it won’t be easy. But we won’t be alone. We have each other. And that’s all that matters.

Thank you for being who you are.

Thank you for just being who you are.
