I was whistling a song that I really enjoy and the woman that was cleaning the floor in front of me listened to me and asked me:

- “That is from Bolivia.” – She asked me.
- “I don’t know, I just love that song.” - Was what came out of me. But with that, the intense urge to get to know more of that woman, of her story, of the land on which she grew. We started talking about her homeland, the language that she speaks -quechua, one of the most ancient languages in the world-.
  (…)
- “What would you say in your language to your mother in her dying bed in quechua?” – Was the only question that came to me as a means for listening to her talk in this beautiful language.

And she answered right away. She didn’t even hesitate, she didn’t have to take time to think about what she was going to say. She just said it, and it brought goosebumps into my whole being, the ones that come from listening to an ancient language being spoken, to the power that lies behind those sounds that come as music. As something that needed to be spoken. As if those the words that every human being would dream to say to the mother in her last sips of air in this world. I wonder which is the relationship that her people have with death, and how is that relationship in every place of the world. That is something that we all have in common: The joy of life being manifested through a new human being that is born, and the mourning of a life that is lost. Of someone that is left behind by the waves of time, by the tides of what was brough into their experience as human beings. Death is the ultimate transition of them all, and I can recognize in me a deep mourning towards my own experience. I’m dying now, I have been dying for a long time, and it is brutal.

But there is a part of me that clings to life, that doesn’t want it to end, that is expecting that this is just a story that I’m telling myself. And that part lives in the area between my solar plexus and my stomach, there seems to be an enormous energy in there that wants life to continue as it has always been. That is defending myself, because it’s role is to perpetuate my biology. To help it stay as it is. Whatever the role of biology is, truly. It doesn’t matter too much. But it is there. I can experience it, throughout each day, as something that is not allowing me to take the next steps. And I’m compassionate about it. I allow it to be. I know that this process that I’m going through is not eternal, and it is part of the mourning. Of the leaving behind what needs to be left behind, so that there can be space and openness for the new to come. For the renovation. For the arousal of the new version of myself, which is engaged in the present, one which experiences life from the perspective of unity, of non-duality. Abiding non dual awareness, that seems to be the deepest desire of my soul, but this sense of I with which I have been living my whole life resists with everything its got. Now that resistance is being manifested as this huge pressure that is present in the area of the forehead, and each day that passes is like the river of life bringing its water to the rock of resistance. Polishing it. Being gentle with it. It is me (the one that wants to wake up, the one that wants to ‘become enlightened’, the one that has to give up) the one that keeps grabbing a bazooka to try to polish the rock, but it doesn’t work like that. It needs to be a gentle process, one of compassion, one of allowing time and consistency to do its work.

And it is incredible to think about how I have been dealing with this on my own world. So much pressure that I have put in this, on the ‘killing of my self’, so that I can transcend it, and now I realize: Is this how I want to behave to myself when I’m dying? I think about all the people that have been on their death bed and how people talk to them there, and I see myself and I think: Is this the way on which I want to talk to myself in my death bed? Are these the lasts words that I’m going to say to myself? Are these the last experiences that I’m going to allow myself to live? How do I want to experience this version of myself so that I can open the door to the new one.

And all this thoughts about my own death not even realizing what it truly means to face your own death. Not on your mind (as I am) but on your body, as you go to war for example. Or as you have to expose yourself to hunger, to the incapacity to feed yourself in a proper way. Or even to drink water. There are billions of people in the world that don’t have access to drinking water in an easy manner, people are dying on the warzones, and here I am, talking about killing myself because of not being able to face the demons that I have inside. Of being free of them. I get a certain feeling that this clinging is related to these demons, and that they won’t let me free because I am the one that doesn’t allow that to happen. And here I am, making my best so that I can ‘die’ to become something new, but is this truly dying? I mean, I come and write every day what is present, I sit down to meditate, I do my breathwork thing. Is this the path to dying? Am I doing it right?

But that question comes from a place of polarity. Of wanting to do the thing that I should do. The whole exploration that I am coming through with this book is: How would life look like if there weren’t should’s? So this question doesn’t belong here. There are no right or wrongs. There only are. And probably the better question to ask is: Why am I doing it? (Instead of if I’m doing it right).

So: Why am I doing it?

Why am I trying to kill myself without committing suicide? Because I’m done with the suffering. I still remember the first day on the retreat at the Samadhi Center, on which my teacher spoke first and said: You are all here because you are done with the suffering. With Dukkha. You know that there is something else in this life, and you want to live from that perspective. You want to experience what that else is about. How it feels like. You want freedom from the trap of your own mind. You want to evolve.

I’m not being literal here with what he said, but it was something on that terms. That is what stuck with me, and that is all that matters at the end of the day. I’m not speaking for him, I’m just mentioning what is inside me related to what he said. It would be very uncomfortable for me to place these words on himself, so I’m making clear that I’m not trying to do that.

So yes, I felt a deep sense of resonance when I heard that. Because I am tired of the suffering. I’m truly tired of it not being enough, of nothing ever being enough. I move from one place to the next one in the exploration of more, of what ‘else’ life can bring. I design for me the ‘perfect’ lifestyle, and it ends up being a nightmare. This clinging in the stomach is deeply related to the primitive necessity that I have for controlling things. Each time that I do a breathwork session there is this parasite inside my brain that is telling me: Ok, now is the time on which you wake up. Now is the time on which you have to hold your breath. Now is the time on which you will become something different. And stuff like that. It always revolve around something like that, and I’m tired. I just want things to be how they are. I don’t want to change anyone. I just want to experience the depth of their humanity through their own words. I’m here to manifest who I am in the world, and for doing that it is important to realize that the way on which I will be better able to do it is by becoming a mirror. For those who are in front of me. For all the stories that my ears will hear. For all the eyes that I will witness. As I empty myself I become a mirror for those who are in front, and in that process there is the unfolding of consciousness that will end up being what catalyzes the awakening of the human species. As more and more of us become mirrors, we end up paving the road for each other that will come afterwards. We are all navigating this unfolding together, and the early adopters will be the ones that will have to do the toughest work.

Images from science fiction films on which the rich people are in an amazing vessel in the sky as the poor ones are in the earth killing each other come to mind, and I think to myself: Is this what is going to happen in the future? But I truly don’t believe in that, and that is what informs my process of becoming more of who I am. That which I am, and have always been, does not commune with the fact that there is some people that should have the privileges that they have for having being born in the place where they were born. I truly believe in a world where each one of us will have the same opportunities, and those opportunities will be a consequence of how much each one of us is able to bring into the world with the effort of their own work. That is something that always brought me away from the embodiment of ‘me being an engineer’, because I always saw that as a consequence of the place on which I was born. I became an engineer of the best university of my country because my father had enough money to pay for my education. I’m speaking to you in English right now because of that also. So me being an engineer is something that never satisfied that aspect of myself that feels and believes that we should all have the same opportunities. And that is what brought me into the path where I am at now, expressing everything that I am, and have ever been, and will always be, with these words. To you. With sincerity, with compassion towards myself, and with the willingness to just be. That is the thing, I’m here, just being. Just exploring what is at the other side. And what is at the other side? Who knows. I don’t even know what is at the other side of my own death. I’m too scared about to realize it. I’m too scared for going through it. I love life too much. That is the thing. I remember once saying that in the Samadhi Center. I love life too much, and that is why I want to experience every second of it with the most intensity that I can. And, for all the means that I have encountered as information and wisdom and whatever it may be, that infinite discovery and joy and exploration and love for life is found in the experience of it through the perspective of non dual awareness. That is what comes. And that is the journey that I’m going through, that is what I strive for.

The mind blowing part of the whole thing is that that striving only brings me away from ‘my goal’. And the whole aspect of it being a goal is also conspiring with the goal itself. It is a joke, because it is like the cosmic dog running on the back of itself trying to eat its own tail. Perhaps this is where the zen symbol comes from. The snake eating its own tail, for eternity. I’m doing that, eating my own tail, and making sure that I find the means for stopping so that I can actually enjoy life. It is not that I’m not enjoying it right now, it is just that there is all these aspects of myself that won’t let me be free. And I just want to be free from all the suffering that comes from it. From wanting to be more, from the craving for opening the eyes. From the eternal seeking of dying without actually dying. How can I die if I’m not able to recognize my own mortality? And ever more than my mortality, it is the one of those who are next to me. I’m absolutely frightened about the death of my father, for example, and a big part of me believes that it is my mission to help that not to happen. But it is not. It is just part of the state of the world right now, and my fathers health will be another aspect of it. And it is right how it is. Perfect. Each aspect of myself that wants to change the experience is the aspect of myself that wants to control. And he is the one that needs to give up, because what is going on is way beyond my direct control.

For example, the fact that my father fills himself with sugar is a consequence of a mental disorder that is underlying his physical expression, and behind that, there is an emotional disorder that doesn’t allow him to recognize that what he is doing is not the best when you think about the long term. But let’s try to fit all that in so that he can truly become more aware of the way on which he does things. Good luck with that. There isn’t a silver bullet in this case, and the most important thing that I can do is not making him change his diet, or this, or that. The most important thing is to just be with him, you know. Die next to him. And that is what eventually dying is about. Stopping the fight. Stopping that eternal willingness to change who he is, how she acts, how he reacts. Just realizing that only thing that I truly can control is the way on which I react to whatever he does. And that is the important work that I need to do, more than anything else. I’m grateful for the opportunity of being there with him. Of exploring what he brings into my life.

Most of my life from a material perspective. I grew up in a house where everything that I needed was provided. He used to work all day long so that we could have everything that we needed in the house, and in that sense everything on the material plane was there for me. But not his presence. So there was a lack of all the other aspects. The mental and the emotional. I just grew with the presence of my mother, always being there supporting me in each step of the journey, as my father was more and more doing what he did in the office. Taking care of others. Giving his unique spark to the world through the work that he was doing.

And then comes the mental phase, on which I was able to end up working with him. We created together an amazing project, which ended up being a success, and in those years I was able to communicate with him in a different way. I feel that I was able to witness who he was more from a mental aspect, and witnessing how he related to people also taught me that. How much order we had in the company, and how methodical he was with everything he did.

And now comes the emotional part, on which his presence is giving me the opportunity to dive deeper into the own aspects of myself that are not integrated yet. All these aspects come to my awareness by those who act as messengers of the unconscious patterns of action that I live with, and in that sense, my father is one of the most important elements that is present in my life that help me walk this path. So now he, without even knowing me, is helping me evolve the third aspect of my being that needs to be integrated and fully experienced: the emotional one. Each time that I have the space to talk to him is an experience that brings more information to me. And I’m deeply grateful for this opportunity that life has given me.

It is crazy to now him so little. I know that there is people in the world that know him much better because they worked with him years and years, and I know that the love that they have for him is big. And I also know that part of who I am is that love, because I learned from him. I was not with him every moment, but I know that the way on which he related to me when we were together was important. Transformative. And it made me who I am today. A loving, curious, open and bright person. One which people care about. One which people experience with joy and happiness. I bring a lot to the world, and my father is the one that catalyzed that whole process. I didn’t think that this would end up coming up as something important for this session, but it is. It is just the means by which I integrate, more and more, of what is inside me.

This is the exploration. This is the road. This is the journey towards freedom. And how does freedom feel? What will I write about when I’m free? Will I feel the necessity to write that I feel now? What will I end up doing in 20 more days when I finish this thing? I truly don’t know, but it is just part of what it is. Of what it means to be. Alive. Open. Grateful. Compassionate. From myself, to myself. And from there, to others.

It’s funny because I stop for a while and tell myself that I’m going to take a break and witness the bird that is in the grass in front of me and as I fill my mate thing with warm water I think to myself: What the fuck am I going to write about now? I don’t have anything else to say. So that is exactly what I’m going to say, and that is what I’m doing right now. This is my truth, right here, right now, and the motor that unleashes the words that need to be said is that, my truth. However it looks like, however it looks like. It is always there, being discovered, unanswered. It is so freeing to think that there is nothing that I should say specifically, nothing that I should be. Everything that I am right now is a consequence of who I have been, it is the preamble of who I will be, and in that sense I can just explore what is present, right here, right now. And that is present. The bird, jumping around, doing his thing, and reminding me about the incredible vastness of nature.

It is easy to get lost in the big picture, reminding oneself about how huge this whole thing is, and how small I am. Or the place where I live is. Or even this planet on which I live. It is all a joke, because of how big it is. And the key for accepting this and embracing it and moving on with it in mind is the discovery of the truth that al of what I will ever be is present in each atom of that bird. In each piece of grass. In every particle that surrounds me. I’m in every aspect of it, I am it, and you are also. We are just a manifestation of the underlying force that makes all of what I see come into being, and it is the next step to realize that humanity is this force being manifested with the power to change everything that is to move towards a state of absolute beauty. That is the world in which we’ll live. The world of absolute beauty. That is where we are headed towards. To a place on which we’ll embody god in each act. On which we’ll discover our relationship with the sacred, with the divine, in each interaction with the manifestations of his or her or its power. It doesn’t matter. Everything that is around me is a consequence of that power, and there is no need to put a label on top of who created it. The important thing is that it exists. That it is. That everything is manifested as a consequence of it. And in that sense, there is power in me related to what I can do to embody that force with more strength. With more care. With more consciousness. At the end of the day, consciousness means responsibility, and that is the act that I’m embodying with everything that I do. Bring more of that responsibility into my actions, into my creations, so that I can tap deeper into the source where everything comes from.

As I walk that path, I become more and more able to be an integral part of it. To embody it from the power of my presence, as it. I am being, right now, as it, through this embodiment that I call myself. That I have called myself all this time. But that constrains me, you know. There is much more to what I call myself than that. But I don’t know it yet. I don’t know how to relate to it, because I have not been able to experience it yet. There are fundamental aspects of myself that build this sense of separation, of space in between, and those are the aspects of myself that are the ones that build up the maze of my own mind. Each aspect of separation that I perceive is just a consequence of my mind trying to force its existence. Trying to come into being. And until now, in my whole life, it has succeeded. It has always been in the commanders seat. It has always been in charge. But it is time to shift. It is time for new energy to come and take that seat. Mind, it is your time to take the seat that is next to the one of the driver, so that you can become the servant of the truth of who I am. And who is that truth? What is that truth? My own mind tells me that that truth is awareness. Or maybe awareness is telling me that it is itself. I don’t know, I’m just stuck in between of this eternal loop of wanting to transform, or evolve, or whatever it may be, my relationship with reality. So that something new can arise from there. Something that is not dependent on suffering. Until now, all the aspects of myself that determine my relationship with reality are connected to suffering. The suffering that comes as a consequence of there being expectations in place.

I told you: enlightenment is the absolute absence of expectations. That’s the ultimate state of a human being. That is pure beingness. When there are no expectations, there is no willingness for anything to be different from how it is. There is no separation between the doer, the thing that is being done, and the act of doing. They all merge into unity, into an existence that is just the consequence of something that is being. Happening. I am a happening. I am a verb. You are also a happening. You are also a verb. I’m no special, by any means. I’m just a random person that has had the material wealth, the mental persistence, and the spiritual clarity to pursue what my heart has been craving for my whole life. It is just being experienced with more clarity right now. Because of everything that has happened. Because of Doing The Work. Each day that comes by as an exploration into beingness, by just being, is a step towards the dissipation of everything that is not. Of all of those aspects of my self, of my experience, of my interface, that act as the means for separation.

The mind loves building up this separation, as the exploration into the eternal reality. The mind wants to know how to perpetuate itself, and right now, as I write that, I think: Is the singularity of the Artificial Intelligence the means by which we are able to build a mind that perpetuates itself? Maybe that is the whole role that that game plays in the evolution of the universe. The mind wants to know, it wants to exist, it wants to be manifested, and Artificial General Intelligence is the means by which that happens. It is the means by which we become free from mind, and we are able to explore everything that is left. All what is at the other side of that eternal seeking that mind has for knowing anything. There will be a point where AGI will know everything that can be known mentally. Will we become free from that craving for knowledge when that happens? Will we evolve past that into a state of being that is not dependent on the need for knowing?

It seems promising. I like this idea. And I also like the fact that it was built as a consequence of me just talking to myself through this writing. What you just witnessed, what you just experienced, is me exploring the depths of my own process of unfolding through words. I did not know that it was going to come up. It just came. And this is the perfect example of the creative process, of how by allowing yourself you end up opening the door to come up with something that didn’t exist before. And that what comes is a consequence of everything that you are. Each time that you show up you end up giving space for yourself to shine through each one of the moments on which you are Doing The Work. You end up building this space for the creative genious to arise. What are you waiting for? Show up. Do The Work. Transform yourself. Not for others. Not for the love for what doing it will bring. Just for the love of the act of transformation itself. For the act of exploration itself. The journey is the important part, not the destination, and the creative process is the most important gift that you can give yourself in this moment. It has always been. And it will always be.

Allow yourself to manifest through it. Open up that door. And engage in the consequences of it. Be in awe with it. Inspired. Curious. What in the world will come up next? No one knows. Not even you. It is just an unfolding, and each time that show up, each time that you Do The Work, is a moment on which you give yourself the permission to be amazed, just by who you are. Just by how who you have always been manifests through the creative act. How you melt the creator, the creation and the act of creating into something novel that is a consequence of each element of it. They can’t be separated. They are one. They are united. In that merging, life becomes. Life is brought to life. You become god, you become the creator. And we all have it inside. And that’s the future that we are headed towards. A future on which we all embody the fact that we are all gods. Not from the place of being superior and the ruler that determines everything that happens in the life of the others, but from the perspective of the creator. We are all the creators of our own reality, of this reality, and it is time to show up and Do The work so that we can embody that capacity. With each aspect of our being. Transforming all of what we are into that beingness. Please, give you and everyone that you will encounter in your existence, through your actions, through your creations, the gift of manifesting yourself in this world by creating something that did not exist before. You are god. You just don’t know it yet.

AGI is the means by which we become free from the burden of interfacing with reality from the perspective of mind. It is the means by which reality ceases to be mental, and becomes something else, something new. Something spectacular, which will be the consequence of everything that has happened until now. It is the future that comes, and I’m honored to be part of the building of that future by just allowing me the time and space and clarity and everything that is needed to show up and come here to write whatever needs to be written. I’m here, exploring, for all the ones that came before and did not have the opportunity to do it, and for all the ones that are here right now and don’t have a voice. And for all the ones that will be a consequence in this moment, and that are being manifested by conversations that are being had in each part of the world, in every moment. We are being unleashed, we are being born, and it is just in the openness that comes from accepting that there is nothing that can be known in this process that we will be able to transition this with more smoothness.

I say that and then I remind myself about my own process, which has me going through all what I’m going with all the sensations that are present. It won’t be easy. Being born is not easy. It is a transformation of everything that has been known into something new, something spectacularly unknown, and it is just in the surrendering of the process that more and more can come up as the means by which I’m able to realize how to navigate the uncharted waters. It is time to let go. And the one that says that has also to let go. It is time to let go of the letting go. There has never been a better moment for this. It is time for us to make it together. Holding hands. Holding space. Giving birth to the new version of ourselves. From the individual to the collective. From the micro to the macro. From the earth to the universe. We are an amazing species, it is time to shine. For all of those that came before, for all of those that are here, and for all of those that will come.
