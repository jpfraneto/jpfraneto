I’m approaching the end of this marathon. Of writing my first book. Most of what I have written is noise and if there was an editing it should be edited, but the most important part of it is the act of showing up, every day, to release the stream of consciousness that wants to come forth. In that sense, the goal has been absolutely accomplished, because here I am, 83 days in, and still doing the work. Consistency is something that is not seen enough because the consequences of what you do may not be clear at first, but the way by which Doing The Work can transform you are infinite. And I’m just beginning to scratch the surface on this. I’m excited about what comes. I’m excited about the capacity that I have for doing cool stuff. For showing up. For realizing the beauty that life entails in my own experience. And building from there. Part of the noise that has been going through in my head the last days was related to which project would I end up doing this next 6 weeks. What am I going to work on? Not knowing this brought anxiety to me, and the willingness to clarify my mind. I guess that the most extreme moment related to this was on Thursday in the breathwork session, on which I felt as if I had a very strong and big cloud in the top of my head that would not allow me to see with clarity what I had to see.

But now I can see. With much more clarity. And with the commitment that comes from sticking to something and staying true to it. That is how I have worked in the last years. Sticking to something and putting my heart in the accomplishment of the small, daily tasks that end up building up whatever I said I would build. And that is powerful. I have opened the door to be transformed, I have opened the door to be creative, and that is all that matters. It is in the acknowledgement of the circumstances of my life that I have been able to make the decisions that I have made, and invest the time, energy, passion and commitment that I have invested in the endeavors that I have pursued. And the end result may be good or bad, it doesn’t really matters. Because I know what I have been through, and I know what I have inside. One day it will all click, it will all make sense, and it is just by opening myself to what life brings as a consequence of what I do that I will be able to unleash my whole potential. And it is a process, you know. It is a step by step process, one which takes time, one which requires patience and trust. Because the consequences of Doing The Work are rarely seen right away. The transformation that is happening within yourself by opening that door are very subtle, and they end up manifesting in the way on which you interact with the world and whatever it brings, more than some specific actions. When you least expect it, you will get a big message from life that will tell you that what you were doing is aligned with what your soul wanted to bring. But until then, you’ve got to show up, and after that moment, you’ve got to show up even more, but it will be easier. That phase of the process on which you will have to hustle and trust and follow your gut is the hardest one of them all (at least in my experience), and because of that there is a very important component of the process that is called community. If you are open to raise your hand and tell the world ‘I need help’, incredible things will end up happening. It is just a matter of being willing to do this, and accept that you need help. Which is one of the hardest things to do, because it requires extreme vulnerability and another word that I can’t find inside. But boy, it feels good. It is awesome to open up this door and realize that you have never been alone. There is always watching, who wants to help you, who wants to bring forth the best of you.

And that is what I want to bring more of to the world. This capacity that we have as human beings for helping each other, and in that, being part of the process of evolution of other humans. It is only through our words, through our actions, that we can truly manifest who we are in the world. I’m thinking about social media, and how the bio part of the profile is an invitation to stick yourself with a particular label. To fix the sum of experiences that account to ‘who you are’ in a particular set of words that bring into you the anxiety of wanting to be someone. Of showing yourself as someone. And that ends up consuming a lot of time, at least in my experience, because you want to get it right. You want to find words that define you in a way that feels comfortable. You want to communicate to others your particular view of the world, and with that, be accepted. At the end of the day, we all want to be accepted. We just want to be loved. And social media is one of the places where that is seen the most. People just wanting to have attention, and that attention has as a consequence a feeling of being loved. But that is something that we have gotten wrong, because having attention does not account to being loved. It doesn’t work like that. What is seen right now in the world is a representation of that. But it is just what we are going through right now as a species in our evolutionary path, and it is perfect like that. As I wrote this I remembered a piece of this book on which I talked about the mindful use of social media. What if you went in there with the clear intention of interacting with other human beings in a level that is deeper that what you can see in the surface? What if those moments were allowed and an active part of the experience? What if we just found a new way of relating to this whole experience of being social? I think that it will all evolve, and we are just seeing this unfold. Step by step. Moment by moment. It is just the process of unleashing of humanity, of our consciousness becoming free, and everything that happens is an integral part of the process.

When I started writing today I had in mind this journey of writing the book as something that resembled a marathon. I haven’t run a marathon (yet), but what I can imagine about it is that when you have 5 kilometers left you still have to grind through and see each step as a stepping stone into what comes next. It is not that you can forget about taking one step after the other one, and in that sense writing this book has been the same. I’m in day 83, but it is the same as every other day. I come here, I show up, I Do The Work, and I allow the words to flow as if it was the first day. It is not something that I’m controlling or trying to change, it is just part of what is. And I need to have into account that what I’m doing here is an integral part of the process, and that what I do every day is also part of it. I come here, I allow myself to be transformed, and I explore what comes at the other side because of it. It is perfect like this. It is just how it works. One day after the other one, with consistency, with perseverance, with passion, and with the deep willingness to bring forth what wouldn’t be brought forth if there was not this commitment in place to Do The Work. I’m here to do it, I’m here to become it, and it is just part of doing what I do. Of sharing with you who I am. Sharing with myself who I am. Opening the door of the realization of that. Through each one of these words, step by step. Moment by moment. Just opening that door, and realizing that the beauty of life is expressed in moments like this. Those moments on which your mind is scattered all around the place, but then you are able to realize that and come back to the object of attention. Come back to the task at hand. May it be focusing in your breath while in deep meditation, or writing these words, or even just playing with your little child. Or cooking. Or eating. Whatever. Just do what you are doing, and bring your consciousness to that moment. When I eat, I eat. When I cook, I cook. And it is very hard to do this, I know it. Yesterday my wife was talking to me about something very important and suddenly I realized that my mind was in an absolutely different place, thinking about something completely different, and I was blaming myself for that. And then I realized that it would be much healthier to just notice that I was in another place, and just bring me back to where I was, listening to her, resonating with her experience. I can’t avoid this to happen, it is just a consequence of being a human being, but I can spot a light into the moments on which this happens and just allow them to be. With compassion towards myself. The compassion that comes from just experiencing what is, without judgements, without a willingness to change it. With equanimity. What an important concept. Equanimity. Seeing things as they are. Your mind went running across the whole array of life experiences that are happening in your life right now as you were listening to your wife talk? Just bring it back. You don’t need to overcomplicate it. You don’t need to make such a big thing about it. Just come back, and realize that you were doing something different. Train yourself to always come back to the focus of what you are doing. That’s how life becomes a meditation. The eternal meditation of just being present with what is. As it is.

That’s how life becomes the eternal journey of being with what is. Just by allowing it to be. Just by exploring what is present, right here, right now. The cosmic joke is about laughing at yourself. Using the human avatar as a vehicle for having fun. I remember a moment in the meditation retreat on which I was doing 3 things at a time: Brushing my teeth, putting my shoes on, and chewing something with my mouth. As soon as I realized that, I could not do anything else than laughing hard at the eternal need that I have for using my time as good as I can. By putting every activity in a small chunk of time. It was just incredibly comic to see, and if you start watching yourself and the stuff you do with this lens you’ll end up having an intense amount of fun just by being with you all day long.

Yesterday I realized with clarity how much people fill their life with stuff to do so that they can avoid being with themselves. It has been something that is present in me also, but I have been actively working on integrating that aspect so that I can just be. With what is. But witnessing others go through this is incredible, at least for me. People will just avoid staring at what is uncomfortable, and it is just a consequence of everything that has happened in their life. I can’t blame them. It is just part of what is. But yesterday I saw this with a lot of clarity, and it was one of those ‘wow’ moments. And also a moment on which I realized how far I am with my practice from most of the people. I have worked in this actively for a long time, and because of that, it is hard for me to resonate or empathize or understand why people behave how they behave. But it is just part of it. And the way on which I can better resonate with it is just by opening the door of listening to them. Without putting myself in the middle.

Yesterday my wife was telling me a very nice story of the mother that she is walking together as a birth doula. It is the first baby that she will help bring into the world, so it is an amazing moment for us. And in the process of talking about what she was sharing with me, there was a moment on which I felt compelled to answer to her with a story of my own life, one that would put what I had to say in front of what she had to say. And as soon as I realized this, I tricked my mind and instead of telling her a story about myself I asked her a question with the intention of taking her deeply into her own story. Something on the lines of “And what was present in you when you did that?” instead of answering “Oh, yes, I can recall a time on which I felt that also…”. It is such a strong and big and incredible difference in the way on which you relate to others. You won’t even realize until you start doing it. The whole way on which you relate to yourself and with the other person is transformed in fundamental ways, and with that, things start happening. There is an opening. And on the moment that you decide to ask a question instead of answering with a story, the biggest transformation happens inside yourself. There is a strong relief. There is peace. There is an acknowledgment of your life story, of the importance of what you have lived that wanted to be shared with the other person, but there is also a recognition that there is something more important to do in this moment. Life flows in a different way through the conversation if you open up to do this. It is powerful. It is incredible.

The most important thing that you can do in your life is to commit to know yourself. To commit to spend your whole existence in a state of introspection that ends up being the way on which you relate to the world, always with the intention of bringing the most out of every interaction by being open to what it brings into your experience. How does this impact me? And that is not a question that you ask rationally. Nope. It is just a question that you pose yourself to be transformed. To truly explore what the situation brings to you. How does it make you feel? What is present in you because of it? How does that speak to you about who you are? Who are you being in that particular moment? Those are all questions that come up as the consequence of just experiencing what is. What is present. Without judging it. Just being with it. Just being through it. That’s the magic of learning how to play this game, the game of just showing up and exploring what comes. What is present. What life entails. This whole thing is a miracle, and what I’m sharing here are just things that I have learned that can help get the most out of it. The ultimate way on which you can experience this game is by bringing your whole and absolute present into what you do. By being with what is. Experiencing what it brings. Whatever shape it takes. It is just part of what is.

And maybe I’m repeating like a parrot here what I have heard before, but it makes the whole sense of the world to me. And in some sense, all what I’m writing here is just an invitation to explore. These are all pointers into what is. Pointers towards a new way of experiencing life, one which will evolve us from the place where we have been living this whole time, deep in the maze of the mind, towards a new way of being. Open to what is. Open to whatever comes. I only know that I don’t know, and that is an exploration into the randomness of what life will bring in the next moment. The only thing that I know is that I don’t know what life will bring. I’m just here to explore it. To deal with it. As it comes. How it comes. Maybe I should call this book “Dukkha: The magic of what is”. Everything just is. That’s the game that we are playing here. That’s the joy of it. The pure joy of experiencing life as what it is. Constant movement. Constant change. An eternal exploration into what it brings. We are so identified with the aspect of ourselves that is defined by the story that we have been telling ourselves this whole time that we are not able to see with more clarity what is at the other side. The freedom of just being. Of exploring what comes from the perspective of what just is. It is time to just be. Open up that door, and just be.

And yes, what has been coming with more and more clarity to me these last days is the project that I will build, for which this whole book is the manifesto. I have been writing about it all this time, without clarity, without knowing the truth of what it is all about. But now I’m seeing a light at the other side, and one of the things that is present now is what was asked for when we had to frame the project. They asked us to bring an idea that we could tell our mother. And my idea is to create transformational journeys that help people transform life into the intersection of a meditation retreat and a music festival. Day over day living through the joy of what these two experiences bring. And I will create a decentralized autonomous organization that will evolve this events time after time. They will happen once a month. For 21 days. And then the whole community will iterate the concept so that it can happen again. With more clarity. With more intention. The whole mission behind each one of this journeys will be the awakening of the ones that participate. And there will be a scientific approach to it. Which are the practices that worked? Which are the ones that didn’t? With this, we’ll be able to iterate towards something that works, and build up more and more of what is needed so that people can have the experience of their true self. It has to be designed in a way that works, in a way that brings up what needs to be brought up from people so that they can have this realization. It will be a journey into doing the work, and today I had the vision of a zoom meeting full of people whose names would be “-“. All the names in the meeting will be the same. No one will be identified by their name, or by what they do. The instructions will be clear, precise, and the mission behind each one of these journeys will be clear also. Build up the weirdness that is needed to confuse the ego, to frame it as what it is, so that awareness can realize that it is not the ego. So that awareness can become free from it. And from there, true and absolute freedom comes as a consequence. What is going to happen in each of these transformational journeys will be the most important experience in the life of each of these persons, and the program will evolve, session after session, so that more and more people can have the experience of waking up. It will be hardcore. It will be intense. It will only be for the people that are done with the suffering. Those who already have thought about killing themselves, and that are tired of going through what they go through. This project will be for those that just want to become free from the burden of being who they are. And the consequence of that is a full integration of what they are, as the truth of just what is: They are. They are who they are. You are who you are, and it is perfect like that.

So yes, the frame that I will build for this project is the transformational journeys, that will be organized by the people, for the people. The mission that I will have in this next 6 weeks is to create a resilient system, one which is based in the practice, in the formal practice of Doing The Work. That is the most important aspect of this whole thing, to show up and Do It. The practice may evolve in the sense that there may be practices that will end up being more helpful than others, and in that sense, it is ok, but the important thing is to build something that forces the collective to go through this transformational journeys together. And which will be the core practices of it? What comes now is the meditation and self inquiry by stream of consciousness writing. What could be spoken of as journaling. But that is something that needs to be talked, and we will have the conversation with the early adopters of this thing so that we can build something that makes sense. It is just something that is going to happen for the first time, and in that, it is important to gather experiences from people from all over the world. At this moment, I don’t even care about waking up myself. It is just part of what I have to do to build a container where other people can wake up, but I don’t feel like as the most important part for me right now. What my heart tells me is that I need to be in service, and that is everything that is important right now. I’m just exploring. I’m just being through this exploration. I’m just transforming myself by allowing something new and important to come forth through me. And this system that I’m building is just a new way of being, one that doesn’t really require anyone else. What I can do with it is build as much resiliency as I can, so that eventually I can be the only one going through a transformational journey and it will be ok like that. There doesn’t need to be something else. It is just what it is. And beauty will come forth from this exploration. I have devoted the last 83 days of my life to building this manifesto as the stepping stone into this project, and now it is time to build it. It is time to transform it into a reality. It is just part of what comes now. It is just part of the magic of it. It has all been about clarifying my mind in a way that helps me understand where I’m heading towards. And now it is clearer. Now it is coming to being. It may be easy to think that people will not have time to do this, or whatever, but I don’t think that is true. What I think is that this program will be so important that people will resign their job to be part of it. They will give up everything that they have so that they can come into one of these transformational journeys, because it is the most important thing that they can do in their life. Transforming the way on which they interface with reality so that they can be part of it from a place of truth. Of their own and particular truth. What can be more important than this? People are fed up with what is going around them. It is time to wake up. And this project will be the means by which that will happen.

And something very important that comes to mind as a consequence of this whole thing is the vipassana style. This has to be free. It has to be open for people to participate. I mean, there has to be a filter, so if it is too much people there can be a way of helping it not go out of bounds (what are the bounds, anyway?). With clear guidelines and with the freedom for people to explore, what can happen at the other side? This project will speak to the true nature of every human being, and in that, there is a trust that that true nature has enough wisdom to be able to experience what needs to be brought to take the most out of the experience. It is built on top of the trust of the underlying intelligence that each of us brings into the world. Of the intelligence of life. Of the intelligence of what is. Things just are. We are here to just be. Everything that will happen with this project is an exploraton into that. Into building a new way of being. A new way of interfacing with reality. The teachings are all out there, the important part is setting them free. Religion, until now, has been centralized. It is time for us to decentralize it. To make it accessible to all of us. And the way to do that is allowing each human being to be the light that brings forth its own religion. It’s own connection with the divine. You have it inside. You are it. Let it shine through each one of your actions.

That’s how we all shine. Acknowledging that each one of us is part of the truth, and that each moment on which we identify with a particular truth it is because there is an aspect of our history as a human being that makes us feel identified with the consequences of that story in our present moment. True freedom comes from embracing that we are not that story that we tell ourselves. It comes from the actual experience of your own and particular truth being manifested through your actions. Embodying how it feels to be you. How it feels to be present. Just allow yourself to perceive reality with more clarity by opening up to the feeling of how it feels to be present with what is. To the freedom that comes from it. The freedom that comes from not wanting to change. From accepting what is. This is the ultimate freedom, and it allows us to explore reality in a whole new way. With a whole new perspective. It is time to shine a light into each human being and the story that it brings, because in that story there is the power to connect with the fact that each of us is basically the same. And there is enormous beauty in that fact. There is a deep freedom that comes from the exploration of what it means to be alive. Each breath is truly a gift. Each smile is a gift. Life is a gift. And we are here to evolve. Humanity is at a turning point in its history, and it is time to bring that new way of being forth. To join each in the path of realizing more of what we already are. Everything that we have been is joining us in this moment to be integrated so that life can evolve from there.

I need to be intelligent in the design and building of what I will build, but most of all, I need to bring my truth to it. Because my truth is this quest into how life feels from the standpoint of being awake. What is awakening? I’ve been writing the last 83 days about it. It is just what it is. It is an experience. It is the realization of your own and particular truth. It is just what it is. Nothing else matters. These are the memes. The memes are what transform the world. They are what the world is about. They are what they are. You are what you are. And this is one of those moments on which what I’m writing stops making sense, and it is ok like that. I can become free from the willingness for it to be good, or not bad, or transformative, or whatever. The impact that it has in me to open up the door for it to be transformative is everything that I need. It is everything that I can bring to the world. This transformation that happens inside me when I allow things to just be. When I allow myself to be experienced through the act of creation. This whole book has been a manifesto of the transformative effect that the act of creation has in the life of an individual, and in that sense, that transformation is just the experience of being alive. Of being with what is. Each second that I’m alive I’m being transformed, I’m being renewed, and maybe this whole thing of the creative act is just a catalyzer for that transformation. A deeper transformation of spirit, because of the allowing of letting it shine through the word that come up. With the clear and definite intention of leaving myself aside, of burning myself in the friction that is generated when I believe that something that I have written is no good. Becoming absolutely free from it. The friction lights up the fire that burns up the self. My self is being burned through each one of this words. It is being transformed into a phoenix, which will come forth from the ashes as a renewed being, one which is better able to manifest its truth into everything that this human avatar does. One that is true. Loyal to its own and particular truth, and loyal to the path of recognizing where this truth lies, and how it is expressed in the world. One that is open and willing to give up everything that has been in the exploration of what just is. That is what this whole project will be about. Of becoming free of everything that has been so that the door for a new way of being can be opened. With acceptance. With compassion. With the willingness to integrate, to evolve. We are at a turning point of history. It is time to wake up.

And this project will be the means by which the world will wake up. It may seem that I’m just talking nonsense, that I’m just exploring what comes in a way that is noisy, redundant, or whatever. But it is not. There is true value in what I have been saying, and there will be a moment on which I’m able to see this value, to witness it, to experience it. To explore it. With everything that comes. With everything that is. Life just is. It is time to open the door to that truth. To the truth that you are an integral part of everything that is around you. You are it. “Thou art thee”. I think that is how it was said. You are it. I am it. We are all it. It is it. It is time to recognize that, so that each one of us can become free from everything that he is not, and in that, unleash all the creative potential that is waiting inside to be unleashed. Manifested. Experienced. Explored. It is time to be free. Welcome to the future. Welcome to the next phase of who we are.
