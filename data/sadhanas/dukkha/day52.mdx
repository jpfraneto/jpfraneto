Where is all the time that is spent before sitting down here to do what I have to do in order to bring out what is present inside? Is there something that is being avoided or it is just part of the process of doing what needs to be done? The last year I was very consistent and thoughtful with my deep work sessions, sitting down almost every morning, and giving them the main priority in the stuff that I had to do. Everything is about prioritizing, and understanding better which are the tasks that need to be done (and in which order) so that you can get the best out of what you are doing. That is the mission of running a life, of being a helpful human being, and I’m learning about it every day. The important thing is just to be mindful about why I am doing what I am doing, and how can I can leave myself aside from the frenzyness of what is going on in the world and stay focused on the long term. The long term is timeless, and what is happening inside me is also related to that.

Today is one of the most important days of my life, because I start my journey as a breathwork therapist. I’m going to work with a person that I care, that I travelled with in India, and that I know has had a very tough life. I don’t feel that I’m ready for this, but I’m going in with all my trust, both in myself and in the willingness that I have to just help. To bring the most sincere aspects of myself into the table so that I can be present for the other person when she needs it. Inside me, that is the role that a therapist plays: Being there for the process of healing of the other person. I have done a lot of work on learning how to be present, and today will be the day on which all that work will be brought into life by being present for the process of evolution of another person. When I think about what is in me right now related to that session, it is just a willingness to explore. There is peace, knowing that I will not do it perfectly, and it is perfect like that. I could feel like an imposter because I don’t know enough yet, but it is something that it is very integrated in myself, and I know that the best way of learning how to do this thing is just doing it. Being in the arena and witnessing what comes from the exploration of what is there. Just by giving my whole presence I will be able to help. It doesn’t help me to think that I will bring the full resolution to this person in just one session. This is a process, and it is a process of understanding that starts today.

I was being trained by my former breathwork therapist, and she told me that we were going to work with a book called “The Presence Process”. The whole book is a guidebook towards a experiential process called just like it, and one of the main aspects of the whole process is the breathing practice. First thing in the morning and last thing in the night, go through a breathing exercise of conscious connected breathing lasting at least 15 minutes each. I suspended my training with this woman because I felt that it was not what I needed, and took another course for training, but I stayed with the book and realized that if I truly want to help other people I need to do the work myself. She told me that the most important part of the training was the personal work, and that’s why I’m mixing what she brought to me (with the book) and what I will learn in the training that I’m at now (the community and all the aspects of learning that are part of the curriculum).

I realized that I need to go through what the book brings so that I can truly embody what is needed to walk next to other people. That’s how I feel comfortable with my own process, so yesterday I started “The Presence Process”. The biggest challenge that it poses for me is that a big part of it is abstaining from substances for the whole duration of the process (12 weeks). I have been smoking weed regularly (1 or 2 times per week) for the last years, and also occasionally drinking alcohol. Abstaining from these substances is a big challenge for me, one which I have not been able to deal with in my life previously. And there is something in there related to what I am avoiding because of that. And it is time to face it. It is only through truly facing it that I will be able towards a state of being that will enable me to be fully present with the people I help. In the book they speak about cannabis being a substance that doesn’t enable the release of deep emotional aspects of what is stuck inside, and it is time for me to release all of that. There are aspects of myself that are battling against this whole thing, but it is enough.

Yesterday I had a very important dream related to this, and I want to mix it with a story that happened before in my life. Once I went to Berkeley and stayed in a house where other 50 university students lived. That night was Halloween, and before the party I went out to buy a bottle of vodka so that I could get a bit drunk. Ah, and when I arrived to the house I also brought with me a 24 pack of beer. All alcohol, being the social grease with which I connected with people by lowering the barriers of myself. So I got drunk, and part of that night is erased from my mind. And it is crazy, because the girl that was hosting me had some mushrooms, later I realized. What would that night have looked like if instead of drinking all that much I had taken those mushrooms? I feel that much of my experience as a human being has been lost because of that constant necessity for drinking. Why all the drinking? What did drinking bring into my life? Why was I so much of a heavy drinker? I wonder that a lot. Which are the doors that were closed because of that. But also the ones that were opened. Anyway. That part of my story is present now, that day on which I went to buy that vodka so that I could have a good time in that party. Always alcohol was like the prerequisite for having a good time. And yesterday in my dream there was that same feeling, of being at a party and thinking: I’m missing something (being drunk). And then desperately going out to the city to buy more alcohol, and realizing that everything was closed. There was no place where to buy more. And the disappointment that came from that. And afterwards realizing that it was ok. That there was nothing needed more than what had been going on right there.

I can see all the moments in my life when I was not able to fully experience the present moment because there was something that was missing. A lot of times. Being with friends and moving around so that I could get more of what was needed to have a better time. Always needing something more, holy shit. I was always searching, and searching, and looking for something that was not there. And most of my life I have spent in that quest, and right now, going through this process of becoming a therapist, finally it makes sense that there is nothing else that is needed more than just being present. And presence is the absence of needing something that is not there. It is the full acceptance of what is actually there. And that is a very freeing thing. Realizing that there is nothing else needed. I recall a few days ago in the house of my parents, having that craving, that willingness to go and look for something else, and just being a witness of it. It is just amazing to start realizing all these things, and learn how to be a witness of the whole process. I can be a witness of anything that happens inside, and explore how it feels to be a witness. How it feels to not be changing what is going on. What it feels to not need anything else than what is there. And that is the mission that I will bring into today’s session, just being able to be with what is present there. Just be with everything that will unfold in the being with which I will be holding the space. That is the thing: Holding space for the transformation that will happen inside her. And also inside me. Today is one of the most important days of my life: The day on which I transform into a therapist. The day on which I go into a journey with the first person that trusts in me enough to guide her. It is an absolute honor, and one that will embody by just trusting why I’m in that position. What brought me into it. How am I present with it. How is it going to inform the way on which I navigate the world. It is all an experience. It is all ourselves having an experience, and it is time for me to embody every aspect of that experience so that I can be more and more of it. So that I can just be present with what is, and train myself more and more in the art of presence. By being present with the person with which I’ll work today, I’ll move towards a more present state of being by traning me in it. That is the game that is going to start to be played today. That is my mission in this whole thing. To be able to be there for others. I feel that I’m repeating myself a lot, but it comes from the willingness to embrace and embody this with everything that I have. True healing comes from the developing of the capacity of being present. There is not a magic wand that will come and change every aspect of your life experience for good, it doesn’t work like that. What happens is that you develop a stronger capacity for being present by just realizing those aspects of yourself that won’t let you navigate life with full trust in who you are. There are all these layers of who you are not that have been built on top of your understanding of the character that you have been playing until now. And all those layers are present in the middle of your experience as a human being and who you truly are. This therapy is an exploration into what happens when those layers are lowered. What remains? Which are the aspects of yourself that are not integrated yet? What are the unconscious patterns that are in there making noise, and being the means by which you can’t navigate life living in the present moment? That is what needs to be better understood. Those unconscious patterns need to be brought into your conscious experience, so that you can integrate those experiences that are not resolved and embody every aspect of your being by just being present with what is. With everything that is. You are the only one that has seen what you have seen. You are the one that has gone through it. And it is your mission to be able to witness it and realize that you are not that. All of those experiences inform your experience as a human being, right here, right now, but they are not what you are. You are way more than that. And it is time to be able to embody that, and I’m here for that process. I’m here to witness, to offer my presence, and to give you the gift of what I have been through so that I can be in service of your own process.

It is very important to be there for the other person. I remember when I was training with my mentor and we had a patient in front, and in one moment I went into my own process, and she afterwards told me that it was very important for that not to happen, because I need to be there for the other person. My own process comes in another moment, right now, right here, I’m just a mirror holding space for the other one. I’m there for her. I will have time for me in the future, in other moments, and it is perfect like that. But for now, I just have to be there for her. I just have to witness, to offer who I am, and with that, navigate the waters that will arise.

Every moment on which I prepare for what will happen is a preconception of the mind, it is an exploration into what is not. I just can’t do it. I can only train myself in presence by being present with what I’m writing right now, because this is the expression of who I am. Right here. Right now. And that is all what it takes. To be here for the other person. There is nothing else that matters truly. Not today. Not here. This is the day on which a new chapter of my life begins, the one on which I’m in service for the path of others. I always have this idea of grandiosity on which I’m helping all the world, creating a youtube channel that has a huge impact, or whatever, and then I come back and realize that the most important thing I can do is just help one person at a time. At least for now, so that I can know which is the impact that my being has in other people.

I have been dealing with the incapacity for being consistent with the way on which I organize each day. I do something and then I do it differently, and I have given myself permission to just be a bit free so that I can rest for how long my body needs to. It has been important to loosen up the schedule a bit, because what is going on is very challenging for me. And today after the breathing session of the morning I was going out for a walk and I realized that I did not want to walk: I wanted to work in the garden. Why going for a walk if I can just be out there doing my thing in the garden so that when my girls wake up they can see something new, a new piece of beauty that is being created in there? I’m sitting in the desk at the office and watching through the window the garden full of flowers of my grandmother, and it just looks amazing. All the colors, al the life that is expressed in there, and just for the sake of it. There is nothing productive on that garden. There is no food being grown in there, it is just there for the enjoyment of the senses. And that is more of what I have to bring into my life, into my house, because I have spent all this time here not caring about how it looks. And it is enough. It is time to give some love to the earth, and I have the best teacher of them all. My grandmother is here, available to teach me all the secrets of years and years of doing her thing. Of having a very beautiful garden. So I proposed myself that a big part of my morning routine will be to work in the soil, in the land, so that I can give back to the earth what it has given to me. I truly want to ground myself, give love to it, and it makes a lot of sense to do it like this. The place on which I live is truly amazing, you won’t even believe it if I told you, and it is time for me to bring more of that beauty onto my backyard by putting the energy into it that it needs. I have always thought that the most important thing that I could do in the early morning was to work in my creative endeavors, but it is not. The most important thing that I will do is to breathe, meditate and then go out and work in the land. Give my energy and power to it, so that I can get the most out of being living in the amazing place where I live. That is the new priority that I brought into me, and that will bring into me a state of mind that will help all the rest that I do be amazing.

That is my mission. That is what I will bring.

Thoughts about the purpose of this manifesto come back again. I thought that until this point there would be more clarity related to what it is all about, but there is not. I’m not sure yet. What do I see myself doing in the middle term? Which is going to be the means by which I make a living? Am I truly worried about this in the day on which a new adventure of my life starts? What comes will be a consequence of who I am today, and every step, every habit that I build will end up building that future. It is time for me to embody the life that I want to embody, and that is all based in creativity.

Right now I started recording this with loom again, as the means for registering the whole process. Accountability has been an important part of my path, and knowing what is going on and being able to come back here and be the witness of all these recordings is something that is very valuable for me. I have 225 recordings of what happened the last year in my journey of becoming a yoga teacher, and a programmer, and it is time for me to come back to these recordings because they are a very strong way on which I’m able to express my consistency with the world. This manifesto is being written as I am here, and there is nothing in it more powerful than you and I being the ones that can see that each word comes out as a full expression of what I am in this moment, without any preconception. That is the magic of this whole process, which has been interrupted some days, which has been pushed back because I had something different to do, whatever. But if I show up and record my screen every time that I do it, there is an element of accountability that is more important than anything else that I could do. It is amazing to be able to see this. To realize that I’m trapped in my own mind, but groove inside it because there is something to be told abiout that. I’m writing a whole book about what it means to be trapped inside your own mind, and every one of these recordings will be the means by which that is recorded in stone. This is who I am right now, this is what I bring to the world, and it is perfect like that. Seeing that round circle in the screen with my face in it is fucking funny. It makes me laugh to be able to see the words coiming out of myself and at the same time stach my face doing it. Being happy, smiling, and just enjoying the depth of my own world. That’s what my therapist once told me. Maybe you didn’t want to play outside because your inner world is too rich. And that may be true. It is rich. Don’t you see it. I’m here, playing with myself, writing these words and witnessing my face as I do it, and it is amazing. It is a testament into how crazy I am. And I feel good with it. I feel good being this weird.

Yesterday I listened to a talk form Terence McKenna and he was talking about how the world will get weirder and weirder. Who are the ones that are going to push the boundaries of that weirdness? Who are the ones that will be pushing forth all that weirdness? For sure I’m going to be one of those. And it will be amazing. It will be inspiring, and a constant pursuit into what is the weirdest thing that I can do. I don’t know which is the next step, I only know which is the one that I’m doing right now. Which is writing this. And recording myself in the process. No one will ever watch this, but it doesn’t matter. I’m not doing it for that. No one will ever read this probably, but it doesn’t matter. I’m doing it for myself. I’m doing it because there is something inside me that needs to be expressed, and this is the way on which it is done. This is the most vulnerable I can be, just offering my truth to the void, to the open space. Where does that open space end? Does it even end? Does it have a velocity of transfer of information? I wonder that, because in the limits of physics and biology there are certainly boundaries that determine what can happen. But are those boundaries real? Which is the underlying truth behind those boundaries? What lies behind them? A big part of me wants to have all the information that I can inside so that I can answer that question from a place of knowledge, but another aspect of myself is the explorer that doesn’t care about that answer and just wants to see which are the boundaries of what is possible by just exploring. Which is the exploration that is being done by me right now? The one of the depths of my consciousness. How I am expressed through the eyes of others. How I am expressed through the being of other people. I am as I interact with them, and it is my mission to bring more and more vulnerability into the world by being it. By expressing myself into it. That’s all that matters. To bring more and more of that vulnerability into the world by opening the doors of what is not accepted in every human being that I interact with. So that healing can come forth. So that true healing can arise from there. That is my mission, and that is what I will do in the middle term. Being there for people. Building stuff, and just being there for them. Expressing what I am in the process. I define who I am by interacting with people like you. That is the most important quote in my life right now, it is the one that resonates the most, and it is the one that I live with every day. I define who I am by interacting with people like you. And I don’t feel comfortable in crowds anymore, hiding behind the speech of the whole group. I have my own voice, and it is better expressed through the curiosity that I feel for learning more, for knowing more, about the human being that is across me. Not in plural, in singular. I could be holding space for thousands of people, but in my world it doesn’t work like that. How it works is for us to be brave enough to be in the spotlight, and to have all the consciousness focused in one individual that could serve as the vehicle for exploring how healing feels like. That is the long term vision that I have for what I’m doing. Having open 1:1 breathwork sessions every day, on which we can work on one person, but with all the people that want to come as energy givers to that particular person. We are all in this together, and if we help heal one person there will be a transformation that will happen in the collective. And that is something powerful, that I have not seen before. There are many things inside me that I want to create that I have not seen before, and the important thing is that I develop the tools for transforming them into a reality. And what is that reality?

The one that comes from my truth. From my own truth. And what are those tools?

Presence is the most important of them all. Just being there. Just witnessing. And after that, the openness to being willing to share my mission with the world. To share with it what I want to create, so that the early adopters will come. And after that things will just happen, as more and more people come with the intention of being that vehicle for change. There is so many people in the world, and it is my mission to be able to channel what I want to bring in such a clear way that people know what to expect from what I want to build. In the middle term I envision people knowing my work and knowing that there is a space for them. As healers and because of that as person that are willing to heal. To do the work.

A big part of doing the work is breaking free from the boundaries that are built into our experience of not trusting enough our creative voice. Creativity is the means by which our soul is expressed, and it is very important to give space to it, at least a little bit, every day. What is going to be the means by which that creativity is expressed? What is going to be the space that you are going to give yourself for expression every day? That is a very personal question, that I can’t answer for you. But I know that it is a muscle that needs to be developed, that has to come forth, so that your truth can be expressed more and more in this material world. The creative act is the vehicle for the soul to be manifested in this physical plane, in the realm on which you interact with other human beings. That is the magic of expressing yourself creatively. It is about being open and vulnerable enough to share your internal world with those that want to listen. It is about the willingness to express your truth, whatever it may be, in the form that comes. It is about the willingness to show up and Do The Work. Which is the work that you’ll do? It can vary in how it is expressed through you, but for me the most important thing is to be consistent with it so that you can start building that muscle of showing up for yourself more and more. If you don’t allow this to happen, you will be waiting for inspiration. And if you are waiting for inspiration, you will lose the outputs that come when you are not inspired, which are as valuable as the ones that come when you are inspired. It is not about the quality of the work that is seen at plain sight, it is about the quality of the work that is built by showing up consistently enough. And it is not about putting all the effort into what will happen in the next week and the forgetting about it, it is about giving yourself the opportunity of doing it more consistently. For at least 88 days. That is my mark. That is the one that I use as the benchmark for work that has a deep impact. The ups and downs that life will bring to you in that time will definetly have an impact in you, but by showing up regularly you will be able to know yourself better by witnessing what is present in all of those moments. The inspired ones. The not inspired ones. That is the magic of consistency. You get to truly learn about yourself, your demons, the resistance that is deep within. And you become friends with it. Know thyself, that is something that has been said for ages as one of the most important pieces of wisdom available, and opening you to the consistency of the creative act is the means by which you allow yourself to become more and more of this knowing.

And it is deeply personal. It is not something that you can extrapolate to other people, or teach someone how to do, or what it brings. What it brings depends solely on the individual and her particular tendencies, and if you allow yourself to have this as the truth that guides your actions you will go far with it. You will get to know yourself more, and better, and deeper. Because there will be something moved. This is the most important thing that you could do in your lifetime, don’t get it wrong. And you can’t get it wrong if you just show up. Whatever comes up will be a consequence of who you are in that particular moment, and it is perfect like that. That is everything that we need and want. Whatever you are in that particular moment will be fixated by the act of creation that you come up with, in that moment. And that is the magic of it. That is the true magic of what comes. You open up to a fixation of your being in a moment in history, by bringing into life something that will be created as a consequence of who you were in that particular moment. And that is the magic. Nothing more, nothing less. Every preconception that you may have related to how ‘good’ the act of creation should be is an expectation that will harm the process. There is nothing good or bad, there only is. And the more you integrate this as part of the reality of what things are, the more free you will become in the act of creation itself. There is no punisher waiting for you to fail. The biggest punisher is the one that you have within, the one that is trying to fit, the one that is trying to be loved, the one that is defending yourself because of the life experiences that you had in your childhood that told you that there was a particular way of being in the world that made you more or less worthy of love. Those are all preconceptions of the mind, making you feel in certain ways that push you back from the act of creation. That make you feel not worthy enough. You can’t live the life that you want to live, because you are not good enough. You don’t deserve it. And that is the biggest piece of BS that exists, because you ARE worthy of love. For the sole reason of being alive you deserve it. And that love expresses itself as the joy that comes from being able to create something that was not there before, and witness it, and witness yourself in the act of creation and saying: Holy shit, that is coming out of me.

That’s what I feel when I’m writing these words and witnessing me in the small camera next to the words. Here is a picture of it:

That is the image that I’m seeing right now. That is where my consciousness is focused. And of course there is an aspect of myself that feels that I’m doing something wrong, that I’m not worthy of feeling free through the writing of these words, that there is something that should be different. But that is the whole point of this book, becoming free of that. Becoming free from what ‘should’ be, and opening up to the possibility of just what is. Showing up to what is and witness it as it is, right here, right now. That is where true freedom comes from.

And that is why by being consistent you allow that freedom to shine through your actions, specially the act of creation. Because you get to know yourself more, and you start becoming friends with this voice inside that tells you that you are not good enough. It won’t go away. It is playing its role. It is doing what it is intended to do. But at the same time, it is your mission make peace with it, and create in spite of it. I’m not free from feeling that it is nonsense to be writing here recording my face. It is part of my reality right now. But I make peace with that fact, and realize that the more I do it the better I become to making peace with the fact that it will always be there. It is not about pushing it down, or building up the mirage that it will go away. Nope, it doesn’t work like that, because it will never go away. It is a consequence of being alive. And it is amazing. It has served you good. It has brought you to this point. But enough is enough, and you’ve got to do your thing in spite of that voice doing its thing. That is the miracle that will happen in the future, more and more people realizing that the truth of their being is expressed through the creative act. By allowing themselves to create, to express themselves, to just be themselves. To set aside all the preconceptions that make them feel, or think, that they ‘should’ be something or someone. What happens when this word is eliminated from the way on which we relate to each other? What comes at the other side of ‘shouldding’ everything? Freedom. The whole capacity of embodying the truth of your being, whatever that truth looks like. It doesn’t matter, it is just who you are. But express it. Share it with us. Share it with those that care enough about you, that resonate with who you are, with what you do, and be open to know that it won’t be the whole world. It can’t be. There is enough people in the world to have an audience for each of us. It is your mission to find yours. But it truly doesn’t matter. Right now I’m creating without an audience, because it comes from my heart. And that is everything that matters. You don’t have to devote your whole existence to this, not yet. There will be a time on which you will be able to live from the creative act, but it isn’t here yet. We haven’t reached that point. But be patient, because we will, sooner or later, and in that moment we will thrive as a purely creative species.

I’m very hopeful for the future, and all what I have just said is an
expression of that hope.

Time to get out for some sunlight and fresh air. This spring air that speaks about a new beginning, with flowers blooming with all the green that brings into them the wonders of what is present in the world right now. The trees are bringing in the energy of all of humanity through each piece of co2 that they process, and that by itself brings a lot into the amount of gratitude that I feel in this moment. Gratitude for being alive, for being part of nature, for being connected to it by something way beyond my understanding. There is much more going on that what we can conceive as real, as present, because there are many ways on which the world works that are beyond our understanding. Or I should say beyond my own understanding, because the one that a scientist that works with trees can have is much more than the one that I have, and there is a scale on which this is true. And that is a certainty for everything. Each person in the world has a different set of skills, a different gathering of experiences that has brought her into the way on which she relates to each moment of his or her existence, and that is one of the most important things to have in mind while existing as a human being.

Every other human being has something to teach you, no matter what her life story is. That’s why being open to having random conversations is so valuable, because you never know where they will end. You never know what you will get out of them, and you can’t possibly know. That is part of why the podcast that I have created is interesting, because it involves going into a random conversation with a random human being in the world, and entering the rabbit hole of what is present for her just in that moment. And that will change in every other moment that we enter that conversation and engage with each other. It is nothing fixed. If we talk today, or tomorrow, the accumulation of experiences that will get us to that point will be different, and that will inform a different conversation that will take place. And that is perfectly valuable, and healthy, and amazing. That is all what it is about. Exploring what is alive in you and in the other person right in that moment, and move from there. You’ll never know where you will end if you approach every one of your interactions like this. And life will always surprise, in the most amazing ways that you can’t imagine. So that is my recommendation now, just be open to the uncertain. To serendipity. To what is hidden at plain sight. You’ll never know what ends up showing up. You’ll never know what to expect, so why not better not expect anything? Why not leave every expectation behind? Enlightenment is the absolute absence of expectations. It is the free flow of life happening through your being, and that is everything that you need to strive for. I only know that I don’t know, that is one of the most famous phrases of all history, and it speaks about this constant striving for not having expectations about anything. Just letting the world surprise you, at any moment. And you are part of that world. You are an integral part of it. So why not allow yourself to be surprised by everything that happens within your domain of perception? Why not be amazed by all of it. That is where the truth comes from. Your own truth, which is not possessed by the biases of who you have been, or who you pretend to be, or who you should be because of who you have been. Nope. It is the absence of all these conceptions, and the opening to what is just here, right now. In this moment. In this exact moment.

What is showing up for you as you read these words?

Who is the you that feels identified by what is showing up?

Are you sure?

Who is in there?

These are all pointers towards the greatest truth of them all, which is that all of those conceptions, expectations and biases that you have within are just a construct of the mind. And you are way beyond the mind. You are what is left when there is no more mind. You are on the background of the mind, being a witness of it, experimenting reality through it. It is time for you to wake up from the dream.

And that is the place where I live and work, one which won’t let me be focused because there is amazing people in the background. I spent too much time thinking that I was too busy to have these kind of conversations, but there is nothing that could be further than the truth. They are important. They need to be had, because they inform deeply who I am, what I’m here for. What I’m doing here is preparing myself to write the book that will come up next, which will be about the colonization of this part of the world. It will tell the story of my family, a story of love, of music, and it will tell the story of the music store that I’m going to open here, in the office where I am at. My whole family is connected to that story, and that is the means by which this dream comes to being. I am in charge of that mission, and I’m surrounded by people that can help me bring it into a reality. The whole story of this place, of my upbringing, of my family, is mine to be told. It is the project that I will start next, having in mind that they are all still alive. They are here for me to ask the questions that need to be asked. For me to interview them. It is the service that I can offer to this place, to create a museum that the world has not seen yet. A museum that is alive in the forest. Há, I’m here during this project talking about the next one, and that is how the maze of my own mind works: Running in circles and navigating all the stories that are being told inside. Making the best out of them. It is part of the fun stuff that is going inside me, bringing into life in my dreams stories of a future that has not been told yet, but which is being created as each one of these words comes forth. That is the magic that is happening as I open up to embody what I came here to embody. Which gratitude could be deeper than the one that I can express to every one of my family? I can do everything in the outer world, be more and more present in it, but how can I truly embody the gratitude of being, of embodying this body, this life, than by writing about the family that made it possible for me to be here? The ones that worked their ass off in this land so that they could survive and give me the opportunity of being here? It seems like the best service that I could do to their memory. Offering them the opportunity of being remembered by writing their story in stone, through a book. It doesn’t matter if anyone reads it, the important thing is that it exists. I have this whole book that I have written until now as a testament that I know how to do what I do. I have something to say. And it is my mission to be able to convey it in a way that is conducent to sharing the story of those that came before. The world is infinite, the possibilities are infinite, and it is time for me to be part of all of those who have been before by just being a small part of them every day. My great-grandfather was a woodworker. My grandfather had a music store. My father was a banker and businessman. I am all of that together, bringing it into life through the craft that I embody: All this writing, all these words that come forth as the expression of everything that I am. This is what I bring. This is the magic that is alive in me. The willingness to help, by encarnating the gratitude of being alive. By honoring those that came before through the stories that have been and were never told. Let’s not forget those stories, and let’s bring them to life by creating something that will last forever. That is the power of this game. That is the power of what is. It has never been a better moment for this to happen, and I owe it to my city. This is the place where I decided to be when I realized that there couldn’t be a better place on which I could be. This is all of what I am. This place is where my roots are, and this is the place where the work needs to be made. Do The Work, and transform who you are and everything that you have been in the process. Who you are when you surrender to what just is? Presence. Pure presence. That’s what I came here to be, and that is also what you came here to be. Pure presence. What remains when there is not anyone looking. What is there when there is no one there. The presence that has always been, and will ever be. The same presence that was experiencing life from the eyes of all of those who came before, and all of those that are here now. And all the ones that will come. It is just like that. We are all the same, and it is just the mind which builds up this separation because it is just its nature. But who are you when that mind is not the frame of reference by which you embody your whole being?

Who are you when you open up to the possibility of being more than what you have ever been?

Who is the you that feels identified by that?
