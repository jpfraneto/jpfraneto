I had a dream yesterday. Quite a cool one.

I was in the central square of the small town on which I live, and there was a gathering of people in a corner of it, one of those that call your attention and make you want to approach the group to be a witness of what they are curious about. I got there, and what had happened was that the biggest bank had been absolutely robbed, it had blown off from the inside, windows were broken, and there was smoke coming out of the window.

It had been completely destroyed, and people were there looking at what remained, taking about the level to which violence had grown, and how different things were from before.

I went walking away, just pondering what I had seen, and suddenly I heard someone on my right yelling to the wind: ‘Twitter and blockchain are going to save the world!’. I approached the person to ask him more about what he just said, but he disappeared, and I woke up.

It is said that dreams are messages from the unconscious, and no wonder that this was another one of those. Those two technologies have been inside me a lot lately, on one side blockchain and the capabilities that it has related to being the means by which energy flows freely and without getting stuck in our society, and on the other side Tweeter, as the means by which each of us can have a voice on the internet, one that is fast, open and without censorship. It is the central square of the internet, where we gather to have conversations with each other, with people from all over the world, and the potential that it has after Elon Musk bought it is huge.

I’m very excited about it.

The last month I have been part of a workshop on which we are working on understanding how to use the platform to build up an audience, a following, and a big aspect of myself has been a little bit uncomfortable with what needs to be done to get the respect of the algorithm that runs the whole thing. That is it: The algo. There is a lot of work done in the background for the whole system to work, it is incredible, but at the end of the day the most important thing related to the usage of the platform is the information that I’m shown when I go in there. What are the tweets that the application shows to me? Where will it point my attention towards? That is everything.

In this course I have been learning the things that I have to do so that I can please it and be shown to more people. That will earn for me a following, and that traction will start to compound over time. There are several aspects of what I ‘should do’ that are not comfortable to me, and that I see as important avenues for growth and betterment of the whole thing. This comes handy in this manifesto because Twitter is the place where a big number of communities start, it is where ‘things are happening’ on the internet, and it is the main means by which I will be able to reach out to people to see if they care to check out what I build. There are maybe better means which I’m not able to see right now, but at least now it is the one that makes more sense.

And it has also been a huge part of my process of personal evolution this last months. What I write there is what I think, what I feel, and what comes from my heart. There is a huge opening that happens when I decide to share with the world my truth, who I am, and I have been going through the process of deeply better knowing myself by exploring my interaction with this platform. Who I decide to follow and how they make me feel. What is the content that I read and give my time to. How do I approach my writing and how I connect with other people. Which are the questions that I leave there in front of other people. Which is my bio, that is the window by which other people see me. Which is the profile picture that I will use so that people can recognize better who I am. I have spent a lot of time lately thinking (and iterating) over all these things, and they have been an integral part of my process of discovery of who I am. As I open to the world, I receive feedback from it, and that makes me grow into a more embodied version of myself. It has been a transformational process, for sure. The perfect companion for the process of transformation that I have gone through as an individual because of my practice.

So yes, Twitter has played a major role in this process, and I truly invite you to explore sharing yourself with the world in an authentic way. You can also be transformed by it. And there are plenty of social media platforms which you can use, it is part of the game to be able to discover which is the one that better suits your needs, but for me, it has been twitter. And yes, I will try to speak down here about the things that I think would make the whole experience better.

1. Social media has always been about maximizing the amount of time that people spend in the platform, consuming content, so that they can sell more advertisement to the users. What if instead of maximizing this time they had another metric of success? Create something that avoids that tendency to ‘doom scroll’, and instead have the powerful content be displayed so that people can go to other places and read more extended articles. What if instead of ‘how much time I spend scrolling’ it was ‘how little time I spend scrolling’? The more valuable the content for you, the better. But that is the thing, people don’t truly know what is valuable, because their behavior ends up being managed by the spikes of dopamine. That’s why doom scrolling is so effective, because people really like doing it. It is the behavior of the 21st century. What if twitter opened up to change this? How could this be changed? Those are big questions, but the potential of twitter to be a place where we can connect with each other is huge.
2. I really don’t like the fact that I have to be as consistent as I can be with the posting of content, so that the algo can favor me and put me in front of other people. I think it would be much healthier for society to have it categorize which content is relevant in a different way. If I have a great following and I stop tweeting, my account may die very soon, and that is very harmful for the mental sanity of the person that is in charge of the account. How can I go on vacation if I know that if I don’t tweet often my positioning in the platform will be very diminished?
3. There is another thing related to the type of content that gets attention. Right now there is a lot of polarization, and all this different emotions that are catalyzed because of the use of this platform, and I wonder which is the way by which this can be transformed. Maybe it is because the algo pushes up the content that has a lot of comments, because it has more engagement, and that brings in more polarization. What is what comes after polarization? I think that it is unity, but it may be the naïve aspect of myself, which thinks that humanity is going to evolve. Maybe it doesn’t happen, and we stay like this forever.
4. Twitter on the blockchain would be awesome. I imagine having everything that I said scripted in a block of stone and being available for me to see it in the future, and it feels amazing. I think that this would be an enhancer of how people behave, because of the social consequences that it could have to express a particular view in public, knowing that everyone, forever, will have access to it. It is interesting for me to think about this option, and I would vote for it.

As I write there are judgements present in me related to me not being too qualified to write about these things. But I’m just a normal user who has some ideas, who has done a few things, and has interacted with the platform quite a lot lately. I mean, not that much, but definitely more than what I would think of 3 years ago. I used to think that social media is the worst thing that has happened to humanity, but now I think the complete opposite. Social Media is the means by which we will evolve, because it is the place where we gather to build up the knowledge of the future. This used to happen in universities, where people would gather to have conversations around particular topics, but now it is on the internet. And Social Media are the entry points of the internet. They are the places where we gather, where we connect with each other, and where we discover who we are by interacting with people that care about the same stuff than we do. That is the magic of what they can do for us, to be that connection in the internet that is so much needed, and it is the place where we can find others. That is the thing. Finding others.

During the whole pandemic, something that caught a lot my attention in a lot of events that I participated in was the repetition of the need of community. People need to feel that they are part of something bigger than themselves, it is a basic human need, and as we open to find others we end up creating those places for ourselves. All this technological tools are the means for that end, at the end of the day. We love to create and spend time together, it is more than important for our evolution, and social media is the place where that starts happening.

The impact that they have can’t be denied, and the fact that a major one like Twitter was bought by a person like Elon Musk gives a huge window of hope. Because it speaks about a change that can be made, that can start, as the willingness for it is in place from the people that make decisions. He is the richest person in the world, and he bought one of the main social media platforms to change the way how it works. This is huge. The impact that this has is not only related to Twitter itself, but to where the priorities of the world are shifting to. It is time to heal, and people are realizing that and there is active change being made for the betterment of humanity.

I don’t have doubts about his intentions, I trust, and I want to be part of this change also. The fact that today I woke up with that dream is amazing, because it speaks to me about the stuff that I most care about. Where I’m walking to. It is very deep in my unconscious, this willingness to help, and finally I feel that I have found the means to do it in a practical way. In a way that can add value to the world, to other humans, and that feels good. I have always been stuck in the bottom of my rock, hiding from the world, and now it is time to get out of there and start exploring how it feels. How it looks out there. How can I use everything that I have gathered down there to guide others, to help them transition into a new way of being.

Twitter is the means by which I learn to equalize my message so that I can communicate in a way that is complete. Until now, I have been just living in my own sphere, caring about my own stuff, and it is time for me to bring more of this to the mind of other people, and for that, I need to learn how to communicate effectively. This is only made by doing it, by exploring it, and this platform has been for me the perfect means for doing that.

And related to the other part of the dream, blockchain, I feel it as the technology that will bring into the world freedom. Yes, freedom from all of those that have been put up in power because of something other than their own merits, and freedom from all of those that keep staying up there without doing what is necessary for it. Freedom from bureaucracies, freedom from waste of resources because of having to go through the stuff that is needed to cover your back. To save your ass in the future. But in the blockchain, this won’t happen, because everything that you do will be recorded in it. And it doesn’t matter if you work in there as an anon, because what matters is the interaction that you have with the platform itself. What it brings to you. What you bring to it. To the whole network. I feel very hopeful.
