I am no one. I come here with the intention of empty myself through each one of these words, so that from there an opening can happen. Something can come forth. I use my own experience as a human being as a vehicle for that opening to happen. I came here with the intention of becoming enlightened, of realizing the truth of my human beingness, abiding non-dual awareness, all those things. I’ve been deep into that exploration, and there is in me a certain kind of fear or anxiety related to not have been able to express it completely through this writing. I have been all this time showing up to write what comes with the intention of sharing with you how it feels to go through this process of awakening, and in me there is a certain fear that it is not enough. It is never enough, and this is just a new expression of that, a new way on which it is manifested in the small corner of reality that comes from the exploration of it through the experience with which I have been identified all this time. That is who I call me, but with a huge, eternal, incessant, growing, infinite desire of experiencing everything that is from a perspective bigger than myself. I have all this conceptual understanding inside that ends up being part of the maze on which I’m running around, and it is a trick that life is playing with me I don’t know why.

Maybe it’s just because it is fun. Yesterday I had a moment of connection with my partner on which I had very intense emotions coming out of myself, and there was a very powerful sense of peace in there. As if everything was in its correct place. Life has the count, and it knows that I have been putting in the energy and the work. I have done what I have to do, every day, to become more of who I already am. If it hasn’t happened yet (whatever it is that I’m hoping to happen), it is time for me to make peace with that and just let time do its thing. In me there is something like an existential clock that used to tell me that if I don’t wake up soon I will go nuts. The pressure in my forehead was so intense that I thought that I was going to die if it didn’t stop soon. I remember when I arrived to the samadhi center three months ago I was telling me before that it was just my mission to get there, and there I could rest. That was everything that I had to do, bring me there and just trust. I did that, I thought the pressure would go away, but it hasn’t. It is still there. But it is being transformed, you know. The cosmic surgery is still taking place, there are still very interesting things happening mainly in the area of my brain, but I have got to the point on which I don’t feel identified with them. The level of trust that I have with the process is just growing. I feel that I’m melting into the experience of what comes. I feel that I can rest in the awareness that I have done my best, and that every word that has come up in this writing is just a testament of that. I may have a very bad disease in the brain and because of that I feel everything that I feel, but if I end up dying because of it, or my brain explodes, or whatever, I’m at peace with that fact. Everything that I have written for the last months is my testament. This is all of who I am, and I have tried my best to convey it to you so that you can feel that you are not alone. I hope that after reading everything that I have written (or parts of it, it doesn’t matter), you are a bit closer to the acknowledgement that you are not the only crazy one.

Each one of us has a voice (I picture it small and grumpy and playful at times) inside that won’t ever leave us alone. It is just a matter of establishing a healthy relationship with it. For example, yesterday in my morning meditation I was basically the whole time thinking about the project that I’m creating. I could not take it out of my sense of awareness, and it was just there happening all that time. And I have the feeling that I felt identified with it, and because of that, I gave it the energy that fueled its happening. Today, I went into the meditation and that started to happen and suddenly I realized that it would never stop, so I had to come back to the actual practice of meditation and just be the witness of that process unfolding, but trying not to go into the thoughts. Just accepting them as part of what was, in that moment, and with that came a lot of freedom. The freedom of accepting what is. The joy of it. The joy that comes from being alive and able to witness how crazy your own mind is, how it never stops. This little voice wants my attention at all times, and it is my mission to give it when it is needed, and when it is not, just stay with my present experience, which is everything that I truly have. And in that experience is where the magic happens. In the allowing of things to be in a particular way. In the recognition that this voice will never leave me alone, that I am crazy, and it is okay like that. I am the only one that is judging myself, and if I integrate all of that as part of my experience as a human being, what comes at the other side is a big sense of freedom.

And it was good, the meditation today was good. I feel very happy for having been so consistent with it, and have it as such an important practice in my life. One which is not highly determined by the theory of the underlying mechanisms of the spiritual side of it. I’m not too attached to knowing a lot about that. I’m just attached to practicing. Yesterday I was in a bookstore where there where a lot of philosophy books, and I realized that most of the times that I have tried to read books like those it was because I wanted to fit in a particular frame of society that could make me feel more valuable. If I bring more knowledge into my experience, I could have different kinds of conversations with intelligent people, and that made me feel that it was worth it. But yesterday I realized that that is not my train of action, at least not now, and I became free of the burden of having to pursue that path. My road is the one of action, of manifesting, of building, of bringing into life. Of creating something that did not exist, and use the information that comes from my experience of being-ness to catalyze that process. I realized that I have spent a big part of my life trying to fit. I’m a person that is not attached to too many things, and I usually go into groups of people, have a very intense experience with them, enjoy a lot their company and everything that comes with it, but then move on and just explore what comes next. It is hard for me to become stuck with the comfort of being with people that I already know. I love the novelty it feeds my soul. There are so many human beings in this world, I want to have a conversation with them all. It is just part of the magic of it. Part of the magic of being a human being. I resist going too deep with my social relationships because I feel that I don’t have time for it. It is the same as when I was in Germany and I told myself that I would never learn german. It was too much of a hustle to learn a language that I would never be able to speak as I speak English. So I decided to never learn it, and don’t give any effort to that pursuit. That is eventually what happens to me right now in respect to my close relationships, because I give most of my energy to my family. To the relationship that I have with my partner, with my little daughter, with her family and mine. It is just what is important for me right now, and I don’t feel that need that I felt in other moments of my life of having an escape valve. I mean, I know that it will be important to have something like that where I can explore different things, but I’m very good at creating those conditions for myself. For putting myself into situations that I feel that I’m not alone. I have done it many, many times, and I will keep doing it because it is just who I am.
It is part of my nature, and it feels good to embrace it and accept it and love it. It is very helpful to recognize that nature and feel at peace with it. This whole game is just a miracle. Yesterday I was talking with my partner about a close relative that she has that is going through a very intense process of developing Alzheimer’s, and through the conversation I realized that truly the best way on which she can deal with it (my partner) is just doing her best to acknowledge that the situation is not going to change. The more free she becomes from the wanting this thing to be different, the more present she will be able to be when she is with this other person. The more she will enjoy it. She is just who she is, and every judgement that the rational mind builds in the middle of this relationship is just a step of division, one which doesn’t help the relationship to be bonded. To be deeper. She remember every part of her life with a lot of detail from before she had that disease, so there is a lot of wealth that can be brought into the life of my partner by just being curious about that. It is easy to stay fixed in the fact that she does not remember the city where she is at, but the truth is that the best that she can do is just accept that, smile, and ask her a question full of wonder. Wonder is the gateway towards a deeper understanding of the truth of the other person. The true curiosity for wanting to know a little bit more of what is going on at the other side. Of what that experience has been for that person. What has happened in her life. It is so easy to stay fixed in our own experience, thinking that it is everything that matters, but when you open up to see life through the eyes of another person, the change that comes is magical. It is truly wonderful.

And in a case like this, with a disease like that, it is just the best thing to do. Leave aside every negation that the mind can create trying for it to be different, and just open up to the truth of what is. In that sense, every disease is just a deep tool of exploration into this practice of being with what is. I know that I speak from a position of privilege, because I haven’t had a close person to take care of in a condition like this, but it is just what is present in my heart when I bring up this topic of exploration. How can I help a person that is going through something like this? Maybe just showing her that the best thing that she can do is learn how to ask questions with wonder.

And now I remember where I was heading to with this, because in one moment yesterday my partner told me ‘Yes, but it is very hard’. And what came to me is that yes, it is hard. And because it is hard, for acting different than the default mode you have to do work. You have to actively do something different, you have to actively be more conscious and aware of your reaction and decide to act differently. It is work. But it is the deepest and most important type of work that you can do, because it opens up the door for an experience as a human being that is transformed. That comes from a place of truth. Not from a place of wanting things to be different, but from a place of acknowledging the way on which things are working, and moving on with that acknowledgement. It is just about having in mind that you are the one that builds your own world, and that this kind of work is the most important one that you can do. Because in the case of the grandmother with Alzheimer’s you have two options: One is trying to fight what is going on and blame her for not remembering stuff, and the other one is expressing curiosity for whatever comes out of her mouth. Activelly being curious about her experience as a human being.

I think that is something that is very important to bring into our relationship with life: The acknowledgement of the elders. Of the ones that have been here longer. We tend to think that we have all the answers, but they have been here for much, much longer. They have seen much more than what we have seen. And they have gone through much more. It is just part of being here for more time, and having witnessed a transformation as deep as the one that has happened lately. It is just magical. It is incredible. And that’s the beauty of it, of opening to be curious and open with the people that have been here for longer. It is about the humility of showing up for them and having the willingness to explore what life looks like through their eyes. That’s something that is deeply present in me right now, as I think of my grandmother, who grew up in a farm, and had to do incredible amounts of very hard work to be able to survive. Her life conditions have changed dramatically, but she is still the same. At the core, she is still the same. And it is incredible to witness this thread of unconscious behavior that goes on and on through each generation, and know that she is also part of that. That she is a consequence of everything that had happened before, and that she never had the opportunity for dealing with it in her own experience. She didn’t have time for it. But now I do have time, and it is a moment for me to heal that so that I can acknowledge all the work that my ancestors did, and that everyone and everything in the history of life has done for me to reach this point, this moment, on which I’m here writing this words to the void. I’m a consequence of everything that has happened before, and I embrace that and I integrate it all in each word that comes out as the focal point of all my beingness. Awareness is being manifested through me with these words. With the creative act that comes from within. That arises from the truth of my beingness. I’m here, I will always be here, and I’m being manifested through what I set free in these words. That is the magical part. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. The one of acknowledging this moment as a consequence of all of them, and realizing that it is everything that is. Every moment that happens is just that, a moment that is. I embrace it with all my being.

I become more of it as I open the door for it to be. For me to be. I become more of myself as I open the door to integrate everything that has ever been into this moment, through myself. Each human being is just an expression of that infinite awareness, and what is happening right now, in myself and in the world, is that that awareness is waking up. It is coming to the realization that it is not the limited self that it had always thought it is, but it is opening the door to a new understanding. A widening of the understanding. A realization. And what comes at the other side of that realization is joy and pure creativity. It is the truth of each being manifested in the creative actions of that being. That is the world where we are heading towards, and each word that has been written in this manifesto is an exploration, an invitation, towards that world. Towards what is at the other side. Welcome to the other side. It is good to be here. It feels warm. It feels open. I feel that I’m being called, and that in that calling there is the feeling of a mother that is opening her arms for me to reach out and feel that I’m loved. That’s what I felt yesterday when I was talking to my partner. That feeling of peace, of knowing that everything will be ok, of knowing that I’m being loved. Taken care of. It is just an invitation to melt into the experience of being who I am, and manifesting everything that comes to me through that experience. All this writing is an invitation for you to become more of who you are, and it is my deep belief that one of the most important means for that to happen is through the creative act. By showing up to Do The Work, you realize in a much deeper way who you are. You open up the door of a new understanding of your own and particular truth. Your unique truth. You realize which is the way on which you can manifest yourself in this reality, and that is just pure beingness. It is the act of acknowledging the rational mind as a tool, and using that tool as a servant for something bigger than yourself. It means being in service, and we are eventually all in that pathway together. In that exploration. We are all being together, exploring what comes, and manifesting the future on which we will live.

It is just incredible to step out and witness what is going on, and what has always been going on. Life is a constant transformation of everything that is into something different, renewed, by the application of energy towards a specific goal. Yesterday I had a slight argument with someone because of she raising her voice to criticize instead of for giving feedback. How would the world look like if we opened the door for being more open to give feedback in the hope of making the thing that we are using better? That’s how nature works, embracing feedback and just evolving with it, without thinking about it. It’s just a system that works by itself, because every part of it is doing its work. If I’m part of an open system and I’m being benefited from it, why wouldn’t I want to help it become better? And I think this is a big transformation in the way on which we speak, because it is very tempting to establish the strength of a voice behind the loudness of someone that is criticizing. Something that came up yesterday for me is that hatred spreads much faster than love and good vibes, but it also lasts for a shorter period of time. What if we gather all the love that has been accumulating in the background of all the hatred that is being spread easily throughout the masses and we allow ourselves to explore what comes from the acknowledgement of our true nature, which is love?

What is going on inside that person that has as a way of having the attention of the world just criticizing the way on which things are done? Is there inside that person an aspect that just wants to make the thing better, and that is willing to offer help for that to happen? The way on which speech is built is powerful, and it is one of the most important tools of our time. The capacity for overcoming that hatred and helping the thing truly become better by focusing on the long term effects of the way on which we relate to each other is very important, and it is something to be developed in the future. And more than for the collective, for ourselves. If I relate to another person from the perspective of hatred, of division, I’m building up those aspects of the relationship within myself. I’m bringing more of that into my experience as a human being. It is just how it works. But if I do the conscious effort of just acknowledging that my natural response is hatred, and then I overcome it by expressing something different into the conversation, and I witness the consequences that it has in all aspects of my relationship with life, it ends up being more and more tempting to act differently. But that is the thing, coming up with this realization takes a lot of work, a lot of self-awareness, and it is something that the world hasn’t developed enough. Yet. There will be a point on which we will get there, and that point is going to be the one on which we will transition into the new way of being. Each of us will become a bee in the beehive of humanity, helping build it for it to become as amazing as it can be.

Do I truly think that if we are all healed the way on which we will related to each other and to life will be absolutely different? Yes. I think so. And this is about true empathy. In the acknowledgment that the unconscious is what rules the life of most of the humans on this planet, and in the acknowledgement of how wounded that unconscious is, there is an avenue of exploration into what is at the other side. Into the recognition that we don’t have to live like that. That you don’t have to live like that. I have spent all this time talking about the collective, about how to heal in a global scale, but it is better to come back to the individual. Because no group will read this as a group. It will be only you, within yourself, digesting the power of this words as they come into you. I’m just being true here, and trying my best to resonate with what I feel inside so that I can write from that place. From a place of truth, my own and particular truth.

What comes as an invitation towards yourself is to Do The Work. Move each day a little bit further into that exploration of what is at the other side of bringing more awareness into your actions, into your experience of reality. Into the way on which you relate to what is going on inside you. Learn how to learn about yourself, by being the witness of everything that shows up in your experience as a human being. What is said as a piece of timeless wisdom is “Know Thyself”. Know yourself. And from there, learn how to live life from the perspective of the one that is always witnessing. It may seem very hard to do, very exhausting to be all the time present with what you are going through, with how you are reacting, with how you are feeling. But actually it is one of the most freeing things to do, because the amount of energy that is spend in all these unconscious patterns of action is just enormous. And all that energy can be put in service of a mission that probably you don’t even understand now. Imagine everything that you are focused on becoming more of who you are. Imagine the freedom that comes from not having to think about how to change your present experience in order for it to be more comfortable. Imagine being in comfort with everything that is, as it is. And this doesn’t mean to stay below a rock waiting for life to go by, it is the absolute opposite. When you walk towards this deeper understanding of yourself, life becomes the most amazing and wonderful exploration.

And in the world that we live today, that exploration is just infinite. There is no limit to it. The resources that used to be necessary for people to be able to create something are becoming more and more easy to get, and what ends up happening because of that is that everyone of us has the opportunity to spend at least a little bit of time creating. Manifesting. Each of us has the opportunity to share our uniqueness with the world, and that has never been easier than now. It is the time for that exploration, and all the tools are in place for that.

And it is a decision, you know? It is a conscious decision that you can walk towards taking with more and more clarity, as you walk the path of realizing what are the unconscious behaviors that end up being the way on which you interface with reality. Life becomes kind of a journey into witnessing these patters of action, and the acceptance of them as part of your reality. They are part of what makes you who you are. And at the beginning it won’t be easy to witness them with more clarity, but as you walk through this journey you will end up becoming more and more aware of how they are manifested and with this you’ll end up being in peace with the fact that they are there. It is about establishing a healthy relationship with this voice in your head that just wants to help you survive. My present understanding of this game is that that’s the role that it plays, just help you to be able to reach this moment of your existence. And I want to congratulate you: you made it. You are here. You are being. So it is just time to acknowledge that, to celebrate it, and to start building day after day a new way, a new relationship with reality. And what I have discovered after all this time of showing up is that Doing The Work is the key component of it. How are you going to show up? What are you going to create? Which is the way by which you will allow life to transform you through the own and unique act of creation that can happen through you?
That’s the thing, that’s the magic. The magic of becoming more of who you have always been. The magic of being who you already are. The magic of embodying your own and particular truth, the one that gets you up every morning, and that has you running around life, getting the most out of it. Until now, you have been doing your best with the resources that you’ve had, we all are. And it is important for me to just acknowledge that, and recognize the effort that it means to have taken you to this moment. You made it. Everything that has happened through the whole history of life has brought everything to this point. The one on which I’m being manifested through these words. The one on which you are being transformed in some way by reading them. And it is not the same moment, I’m writing now, you’ll read later, but in some way time is being stopped as I write these words. Because I’m putting all my intention into becoming them. I’m putting everything that I am into the understanding that I’m being manifested through them.

And I want to invite you to do the same. To witness what they bring into your experience as a human being, and see how they resonate with you. See how they are transforming you, right here, right now. Witness the sensations that you have in your body. I want to invite to you embrace them with equanimity, not trying to change anything about your experience. Let what is, be. Let yourself be manifested in the world by the reaction that you are having with what you have read. Let yourself just explore what it means to be a human being by being the witness of another one doing the best that he can to convey everything that he has inside, everything that he is, in a way that hopes to transform himself. Because yes, my intentions are selfish. I’m not writing this for you. I’m writing it for myself, because the act of creation is fundamentally an act of transformation of the creator. It is the means by which I put my beingness in service of my own evolution. I’m being in service for myself, and with that, I’m being in service for every other being that exists.

That’s what I think that we have gotten wrong. Selfishness. I’m not clear with that concept and what it brings, but I do think that it is important that we take care of ourselves so that we can act from a place that is healthy for us and for the rest. From there grow outwards. So yes, I’m being selfish, but it is just in the pursuit of a deeper and clearer and more pure expression of my whole beingness. So that there can be a deep aspect of yourself that can resonate with that. What you have inside is the same as what I have inside, and I’m talking from that place inside me to the one that is inside you. So now it is time to ask the question:

Who is the one that is listening?
Who is the one that has been transformed by everything that has been read the last minutes?
How does that feel inside?
How does it feel to be you?

All these are just prompts into that deeper exploration of yourself, of your own truth, so that from there an opening can happen. A deepening of your relationship with yourself, and with that, with others. With the growing comprehension that everything that you are is present in every other thing that there is. When I say this I’m not talking from a place of experience, because I don’t experience life from that perspective. I’m talking from a place of respect, of the acknowledgement of the road that has been walked by many others that came before, and in that acknowledgement there is an infinite wealth. An infinite capacity for life to be manifested through the beingness of all of us. Through the capacity that we have to express ourselves, to communicate, to experience. To witness. To be. We came here to just be, and it is in that exploration that we can become more and more of what we have always been. It is just by allowing yourself to be that you will become more of who you are. And that which you already are is waiting for you to experience it. You are waiting to be experienced in your absolute capacity. You are ready for being manifested through each aspect of your beingness. You are here for that. You came here to manifest your own, unique and particular truth, and it is time for life to give you the space that you deserve. The one that you have always been. The one that you have been waiting for. It is just in that exploration that you will become more and more and more and more of who you are, and what comes at the other side of that is absolute freedom.

Welcome to the future. It’s nice to have you on board. Thank you for being who you are.

Thank you for being who you have always been.
