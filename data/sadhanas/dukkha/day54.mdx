Another day of coming here of being the witness of myself. I could start this session by talking to you about how much I delayed coming here and starting to do this thing, but I won’t. I won’t complain about it, because that is the purpose of this whole book. It is me, learning how to not complain about the stuff that I do, and embracing them as parts of my own reality. There is nothing I ‘should’ do. I ‘shouldn’t’ have come earlier. It doesn’t work like that. It is not the way to get ‘more creative’, because those boundariers and barriers and ways of doing my thing are only building ways on which I’m not able to express fully who I am. Today I made progress towards what I would call comfort in the morning, by waking up and doing my thing in the house, I did some yoga, breathed and meditated. Perfect start of the day. But there is nothing as perfect, it was just what it was. You don’t even imagine how much I have tried to ‘get it perfect’ with the organization of my day. It is a fuckin’ maze. I can’t remember the last time that I let myself free of everything and just let go of that and went into the day with whatever it took. There is always this noise present that I should be doing something else, and as I have told you in previous days, all what I’m doing here is exploring what comes when I try my best to bring more and more of the understanding that there is nothing as perfect in this world. There is only change, and if I’m changing from one day to the next one it is just part of what is. If I allow myself to realize that I spent the morning with my wife and daughter and enjoy everything that that brought, I will be more peaceful. So yes, this is the moment on which I embody that, and set myself free of the expectation that I should be somewhere else, doing this from before. ‘I should be right now 2 hours in, having written 10 pages.’ Fuck it. It is perfect as it is.

It doesn’t matter what has happened until now, the only thing that matters is that this moment is. That I’m here, doing it, starting at the black page with my soul being unleashed in all the words that I’m writing now. That’s peace. Yesterday someone told me that it was a good thing to get your whole existence shattered from time to time, and coming here to write is the means by which I do it every day. I’m able to realize better who I am by coming here to write. I’m showing up for myself. Not for ‘the best version of myself’, or for ‘my true self’. I’m just here, present with what is, and I accept it and welcome it as it comes. It doesn’t really matter how it comes. What matters is that it comes. And all the delay that was happening before is something that I needed in order to remind me -once more- about the importance of sitting down to Do The Work. It’s important. It’s the key. There is nothing that is more important than this, right now, in my life. Because taking care of my daughter and family is even more important than that, but beyond this life. The work that I’m doing with them is eternal, because being with my daughter on her process of upbringing, with my wife as I go through the process of becoming more and more of myself, detached from everything that I have not been, is the transcendent aspect of who I am. Right here, right now. It is time to share myself.

That is something that I have a hard time with. Finding that balance between the deep work sessions and sharing myself so that I can better connect with the people that are around me, and with that, learn more about myself. Yesterday I wrote that by interacting with other people you understand better who you are by shining a light on your biases, and that’s how it truly works. And I spent a long time hiding inside myself, going through my own challenges, but always on my own. Always on the comfort of my own solitude. And my solitude is interesting, its fun. I was all the last year in there, teaching myself how to code, building stuff, creating, and just as that, right now I’m doing it again. And there is not a clear understanding in me related to how I share myself, how I bring myself into the world. How do I share my work, who I am. I mean, I’m doing it with this writing, but it is confined to the limits of my own boundaries. I’m here, writing, and publishing it into a website that doesn’t have any kind of traction. And even this, my writing, doesn’t have any kind of traction. No one reads it. It is a lot. But does it really matter? What am I doing it for? Since I was born I was raised to bring eyes to myself, to my actions, and get love and attention from there. The seeking for approval is something that has been always present in the way on which I experience life, and I am here writing this so that I can better understand it. Because I read yesterday that it is deeply embedded within us as modern humans, but I don’t really know if I can fit into those categories. Because right now I’m doing all this stuff without seeking approval. Is that even true? Don’t I want approval? How does it feel to me that no one reads this? That no one approves it? Not even me. I don’t read it afterwards. But not because anything more than the curiosity that comes when I realize how interesting it will be to come back and read this in the future. How has your life changed, my friend? And I ask this question to you, that are reading, not only my future version but you, as a random reader that came across my work. How has it changed you? How different is your perspective on this whole enlightenment thing now? I’m not talking about the conceptual stuff here, I’m not talking about what enlightenment is, I’m just sharing with you, day after day, how it fucking feels to want that thing with everything you are and not being able to ‘attain’ it, because it is something that can’t be attained. It is not something that ‘you can get’. I can’t get to it, because it is already here. And I’m not able to realize it because of all of that trying. But I can’t become free of it, and because of that, I tend to suffer. But do I really suffer? I don’t know. It is part of the mystery. Because of all what I have been through I don’t even know if I’m suffering or not. I’m just being. What is happening through me is just being, and that is all of what this whole thing is about. Enlightenment is the absolute embodiment of being. It is the erasing of expectations. The perfect equilibrium. That was what happened to me in that first meditation retreat that I was part of, Vipasanna, on which I had the most transcendent meditation state that I’ve had after realizing that the key to the whole thing was balance. And it was inside me. It had always been. It is just a matter of remembering.

I remember it as if it was yesterday, being outside the Zendo very frustrated because I was not able to stay in meditation for a longer period of time, and I found a table that was balanced on top of a round log. I laid on my back on top of the big table, and started balancing from one place to another, until when I was finally able to stay in the middle, balanced. There were some perturbations here and there that brought me out of that balance, but inside me there was always this knowing that, because I’ve been in the place where balance comes from, I knew the way.

And which is that way?

When I write that I knew the way, I feel like an absolute imposter. The same as I feel right here, right now, when there is aspects of myself that felt exposed because I’m sharing what I write as it comes. That is the hard part of this game, keeping the truth coming when there is knowledge that there is someone else that may be watching. Keeping it coming when there is an exposure. Keeping it coming when there are stakes. Because until now, there hasn’t been more stakes in place that the ones that I have built for myself, and those are the ones that are inside my own mind. I just record the sessions on Loom, keeping the videos for myself, towards eternity. No one will ever witness them, because they are buried inside hours and hours of videos that don’t make any sense, just me doing my thing, trying to push through my own mind so that I can come up with something original. And that is what I’m doing here, because who I am right now, at this moment, IS original. It is a new expression of myself, one which is greated, generated, summoned, coming into being, right here, right now. There isn’t anything of my direct experience right now as a human being that is similar to something that was before, and that is the story that I’m telling myself as the means for going deeper and deeper into what it means to ‘only know what I don’t know’. I’m approaching my lifetime from the eyes of a newborn, each second, and every word that comes up in this writing is a new exploration into what is being born in every second. And what is that? What does that even mean? What am I expecting to achieve by sitting down and doing this thing? I don’t really know. Maybe it is just occupying the space in the phone of the person that is watching so that he can sit down and Do The Work. Because the work is never done in the phone. I mean, it could, but I don’t know too much about it. The Work is done elsewhere, in a place where you can bring yourself into reality through other means. You just need more space, more bandwidth, more canvas to Do It. At least that is my experience. If I didn’t have my computer to write, I would do it in another place. I would come up with new and novel ways of doing it. Maybe just in paper.

And what does that even mean. I’m not sure. That is the exploration that comes about, the one that is shown by allowing each and every word to come up, to be expressed, to be released. Because it feels like that, like a release, that comes and goes each time that I allow it. The affirmation that I am repeating to myself these days is, in Spanish: ‘Decido vivenciar este momento’. I decide to live this moment. It is a decision. I decide to embody this moment, through the allowance of anything that wants to show up to show up. I decide to embody all of my being through my writing, and that is all that matters right here, right now. The rest will end up being history, the history that I tell myself, that others tell about myself, and that is just the magic of being one more of all these humans that are alive right now. I have the opportunity, to possibility, the gift, to be able to create something that did not exist before, and build it as a reality with which other humans can interact. That is something that was not possible before. Right now I can click a button and share this truth, my truth, to the world from the palm of my hand. And what is my intention with it? What do I want to achieve by sharing what I do with the world? Just awareness. The awareness that is needed to come up with the answers that you need, right here, right now. You have everything that you need to sit down and do the work. There is nothing more that you should be, or achieve, or come up with so that your work could be more desirable or less. Because the end receiver of it is you, as you go through. The shorter the timespan on which you care about the receptor of whatever you are creating, the more connected it will be to the source. And if that delay is erased, if there is not delay at all, it will be the source talking to itself. Coming up with something novel as an expression of the source from the tip of your being, but not medited by the necesessity of attention, that burning necessity of acceptance that has been built into our system since we were young. And I’m sorry to put yourself into my words, you don’t deserve me to do it. I’m sorry if I’m putting in your experience something that was not there before, I will try my best not to do it anymore. It is just that I can’t help it. I want to truly bring something into the world that helps, and that’s why I think that it is my mission to bring more and more of help to others. But it doesn’t work like that. Doing The Work is a very personal endeavor, and I will do my best to frame it from that perspective. I’m just here, showing up for myself, and realizing more and more of what it means to create by just allowing myself to do it. To bring it into a reality through my words, right here, right now.

So as I was saying, what is being brought is the notion that each moment that I spend perceiving the object of my creation as something separate from myself by picturing it as something that should appeal to someone specific that is not myself, I’m diluting the amount of consciousness that is brought into that object because of the creative act that is being manifested through me. When I’m able to forget about that, when I’m able just to merge my being into the act of creation, I become the creation itself. And that is the highest form of life, the highest form of being. Pure creation. Pure creative act. And right now I’m experimenting that with my writing, bringing more and more awareness into this moment by just embodying it with everything that I have, trying to forget the fact that I’m broadcasting it to the world and that there could be people watching and judging me. Each time that I feel judged is a window into getting to know myself better. Each judgement that comes through my being is an aspect of my life story that is wanting to be expressed, but that I’m not allowing myself to. I’m judging myself because I feel that I’m not good enough, I feel that what I do is not good enough, and it should be more. See? There comes that word again. The end of shoulds is about the end of judgements. What happens when I fully accept and embrace every aspect of my being as part of the truth of who I am? What is the consequence of that? What is the being-ness that arises from that truth? What is the embodiment of truth that comes forth through my actions when I allow myself to not judge myself and accept every aspect of who I am right here, right now? That is the magic that comes. That is the mystery. That is the game. That is the eternal game that I have been playing until now. I was about to write ‘we’, but I told you before that I would do my best to not put you into the same bag. I can’t relate to your experience, but if you can relate to mine, it is being written here so that you can. If there is something in here than you can relate to, feel free to do it. Every word that has been written in this book is an exploration into what happens when I allow myself to just be, to just express my truth, and there is a deep knowing inside me that tells me that when everything else is erased, all the biases, all the stories, all the shoulds, my truth is the same as yours. I am a physical manifestation of awareness exploring this material reality through my life experience, the same as you. So yes, if you can relate to anything that I have written about here, be my guest. I’m doing it for me, but I’m also doing it for you. It is good to feel represented. It is good to not feel alone. It is good to realize that you are not the only crazy one. This guy is writing in his computer all this crazy shit as he is broadcasting it to the whole world. What the fuck. What is this whole game about. But yes, here I am, being as weird and crazy as I can be so that you can realize that it is ok to be like that. It is ok to feel weird, because it is getting weirder and weirder. And it won’t hold back, because as more and more of us realize that the story that we have…. Holy shit, there I am writing about us again. Sorry.

It is going to become weirder and weirder, as I embody the truth of my being. And that truth is that there isn’t an aspect of myself that I can predict, because each aspect of myself is manifested through the exploration of what each moment brings. I don’t know what will happen next, I don’t know who I will be tomorrow, because that’s just part of the game. The eternal game of moving towards the exploration of what is here, now. Present. Who am I in this right and precise moment? You are already witnessing it. I am reach one of these words. I am a manifestation of consciousness coming into life through this ideas, through this words, and that is all that matters right now. There is nothing more than that, because it just is.

And yes, it makes sense to come back to what I was talking before related to the distance between the receptor of the creation that is being manifested and the projector cage from where it is coming. So ‘I’ am the one that is coming up with this, and if the receptor that I have in mind when I write is further down the road, it feels that there is a kind of separation being manifested inside the experience of this present moment. There is something that truly doesn’t feel right, because the act of creation is being brought forth for something more than the act of creation itself. If I’m trying to please someone with this creation, I’m separating myself. I’m living in a moment that is not real. It is an invention of my mind. But if I’m here, just witnessing what is being brought forth by what I’m writing each moment, that separation is dissolved into the experience of what is present, right here, right now. There is no separation present, because the consumer of the act of creation is part of the act of creation itself. And that brings about the necessity for it to be of good quality, but as soon as I write the word good there is a movement of energy inside that makes me think that that whole concept is not representative of reality. How do I know that something is of ‘good’ quality? How could I tell? How could I frame it? It is just on the dissociation that that duality starts to arise, and it is time for me to realize that so that I become free of all the ‘shoulds’. There is nothing that ‘should’ be, because it just is. What is being manifested through me right now just is, it doesn’t have any preconception, any particular thing that should be happening beyond it. It just is, and that is what matters. So there are no ‘shoulds’, there are only ares. There are only manifestations of what is being brought forth.

And what comes now is a live streaming that I watched yesterday, I mean I saw that someone posted it but didn’t watch it. So it is better to say that I was aware of it. And it that, the programmer was getting very deep inside twitter and realizing how it works. And I’m sure that he was not thinking about all this shit that I’m talking of awareness and stuff. He was just there, doing his thing, being deeply embedded in the act of creation that was being manifested through his expertise as a programmer. So who am I really to say that this is not a ‘complete’ creative expression? What does that even mean? I can’t speak for him, so it doesn’t make any sense that I do it. And it doesn’t make sense also to compare, because what he was doing, who he was being through what he was doing, is an absolutely different expression of consciousness as the one that I’m manifesting right now. This stream of consciousness does not require for me to think, actually the whole opposite. The less I think, the more I am. At least for now.

And who is the ‘I’ that is refering to itself as those words are written?

That is the maze on which I’m at right now. That is the maze that I have been in for this whole 55 days. And what do I even mean with those 55 days. I’ve been there all my life, it is just that now I am aware of it. I’m aware that I’m playing a character in this adventure called life, and I’m aware that there is a way out, but I’m moving my hands through each and every inch of the wall trying to look for that door to find it and open it and get out but there doesn’t seem to be any door in here. I know that there are no doors to look for, but I truly don’t know how to stop looking for it. It is just part of the maze. That’s truly the maze. Wanting and wanting and wanting to find that door but not being able to. That’s the game that is being played, that is the joke, that is the fun part of this whole thing. When you realize that the more and more you do, the less and less you get towards where you wanted to go, because there isn’t truly anywhere to go. There is only somewhere to be, and that place is right here, right now, through the object of creation that is being manifested in this exact moment.

It doesn’t make any sense to think or project or plan about what will happen in the next moment, in the future, because it will never come up as you want it to. It just doesn’t work like that. Each time that I have seen myself projecting the future I have found myself hitting a big wall, one which tells me constantly that there is nothing that can be planned because all that planning comes from a mind that loves projecting into the future to feel safe, but that safety is just a mirage, it is just what is brought up after years of years of being here, but it is not at all a truth that we can talk about as real. Nothing that my mind projects has ever been real, and this is the moment on which I embrace that and move on. Yes, it is time to move on.

And the funny part of this whole thing is that I’m constantly hoping for something major to happen. There seems to be a particular energy moving through my self and as soon as I’m aware of it, there is a voice inside me that says: ‘That’s it! I’m realizing the truth’. And there comes the disappointment again. It is always like that, it has been like that and I wonder when it will stop being like that. It feels like one of those games where there is a mole coming from a hole and you have to hit it with the hammer and as soon as you are aware that it is out and you move the hammer it is gone so the only thing that you’ve got left is to try to predict what hole it will come from and it ends up being that game of prediction instead of reaction. And all that prediction is just living in a present that is not hear. I’m predicting how my life will look like when I will ‘become enlightened’. And yes, it feels good to talk about it, to embrace it, because each part of my being feels that way. My head is on fire with the willingness to go through the gateless gate, and all what I have written in these 55 days is just an expression of that. It is just me running around the maze, moving my hand through the wall searching and searching and searching for that door, pretending that I’m not searching, trying to play the fool with that omniscient narrator that is inside my head playing tricks against itself.

That’s how crazy I am, just playing those games inside and realizing that they won’t stop. And also realizing that there are no tools inside me to make them stop. Funny enough, when I talk about them, when I write about this whole process, they seem to stop. There seems to be something that stops moving, and just lets arise what has not been allowed to arise before because of all this movement. That is when the truth of my being begins to be expressed, just by giving it space.

And yes, there is a big willingness inside me to be more knowleadgeable about everything so that I can share more and more of it with the world and help the world become more educated by it, but there is a deep feeling inside me right now that that is not what the world needs from me. It doesn’t need me to educate them. It needs me just to be myself, so that I can help each human being realize that who they are here, right now, is a perfect expression of who they have always been. You are already all of who you will be, and there is pure perfection in that realization. All of what you think you have been, and all of what you think you’ll become, is just that, part of the expression of duality in this material world. That’s the game we are all playing here.

And what a fun game it is. Full of wonder. Full of marvels. Full of perfection. Full of interesting things happening all around. Full of action for each human being, no matter where he is, no matter who she may become. There is something going on for each one of us, and only in that there is a lot of value to be reached. To be gotten out of. Everything that you are going to become in the future of your small sized ego is just that, part of that expression, but you are already everything that you are. And I write this and I think more about how technology has evolved and I wonder which is the limit of that small line that is drawn between technology and humans. How does the former inform the latter? How are we shaped by everything that we have available for us? And how are we not? What is the purpose of all this technology in the arc of evolution of the human species? This may be the most boring live stream of them all, but you don’t realize that what I’m doing here is just exploring what it means to share myself to the world. You don’t realize how hard that has been in my life, how much below the rock I have stayed all this time, so just opening to share this, my truth, with you, is everything that I need right now. Everything that happens beyond this is a consequence of me giving me this gift. This is truly a gift that I give to myself. When was the last time that you gave a gift to yourself?

I did it two days ago. It is a soccer ball, that I’m carrying around all this time with me. I come to the office and it is here, with me. I used to sleep with my soccer shoes, when I was younger, and that is something that I have left behind because of all this willingness that I’ve had of being spiritual, of being more snobbish, more intellectual, etc. It is just another expression of something that has been present in my whole life, which is my constant necessity for being accepted. When I was in the retreat at the Samadhi center I realized deeply that each time that my mind was telling itself a story about something that will happen in the future it was coming out of that deep necessity of being accepted. I truly wanted to be accepted, and coming up with stories that would help me do it was the perfect way to go. I’ve always had good stories to tell, so if I spent each present moment thinking about the stories that I would tell I could become more and more accepted by society. And that is the game. That is the thing that we were playing. I don’t really know how to tackle it, but I surely did understand that. And I’m going there because of the soccer ball, because of returning to my childhood through the connection with that ball. I’ve spent so much time denying parts of myself that I don’t completely accept, and it is time for me to realize that this necessity for acceptance is a big aspect of what governs my relationship with reality. I accept it, embrace it, and move on with it. It is the game that I have been playing, but this it the moment on which I give up all of those stories that I want to pretend to be and I just embody the one that I am here, right now. This is my truth, and I’m sharing it with myself so that it can be witnessed in the first hand perspective. Each word is being manifested because of a deep willingness to be accepted, and that acceptance comes forth out of myself. I am the one that needs to accept himself. I am the one that is creating all this fictional story inside so that I can accept myself.

Yes, who I thought I am, who I have come up to believe that I am, is just another manifestation of that deep willingness to be loved, to be accepted. And the way on which it manifests itself in my creative process is through this separation that I spoke of before. I am through my act of creation, and when I don’t allow me to be I stop fully embodying who I am. What I came here to do.

And yes, that was something that was missing from before. All this act of creation that is being manifested through me is my bet on that eternal game of wanting to love myself. I just want to be able to love myself. I just want to look myself at the mirror and be able to express gratitude to who looks backs and tell him: ‘Thank you’. I’ve never truly been able to do that, because nothing is ever enough. I’m constantly running on the back of what I should do, what I must do in order to become someone, and this is the moment on which I give a step towards the internalization of that. The embodiment of it. And with that step comes responsibility, the one of being responsible of building my own reality. As I told you before, I decide to live in the present moment. It is a decision. And with making decisions, there comes responsibilities. Of being faithful to it, to the decisions that were made, and for the reasons that brought about those decisions. I embody them, and I move every day a little bit closer toward the embodiment of each one of the decisions that I have made throughout my life, because they are the ones that build me as a human being right now. Each one of them is a representation, an image that is fixed in time related to my priorities in that moment, and in that sense, it is all perfect because it is what has brought me into this moment. Right here, right now. And it is perefect like this. I’m grateful for it.
