Asd. That is the chain of letters that always shows up when I start witnessing if the keyboard is working. As the starting point, as the reminder of life doing its thing. The keys are still in the same point, waiting for me to press them in a particular order that will end up bringing about the rant that I’m going to share with you right now. What am I going to talk about? I don’t know. Every one of these writings is just an exploration into the prompt: Tell me who you are. I ask that to myself. Tell me who you are.

Today in the morning meditation there was a kind of battle going on inside me, with one part of my mind trying to think all the thoughts that can be contained on the universe, and another voice in there asking that other one: Tell me who you are! As if there was a way of realizing that the mind is a construct that lives inside there but cannot be conceptualized because it is just trying to conceptualize itself. So there I go, round and round, having inside this thought: Who am I? What is what is going on inside this head, inside this body, inside this being, that I can recognize as myself? Where is that myself hosted? Where does it live? Where does it act from? Something that comes in as valuable information for answering this is having in mind the breath. As I write these words, there is an aspect of me that tells me: Focus on your breath. Make it conscious. And as I go through the act of doing that, of making my breath slower, there is still this pursuit of words coming up. It is still happening. I am divided, there is something going on in here, but I’m not able to realize which of all these divisions is the ‘me’ from which they arise.

And that is obviously because that ‘me’ lies in a different realm than those divisions. Every division is a consequence of the activity of the mind, and in the quest of finding those divisions there is more and more division. I can recall my teacher telling us that the mind loves dividing, separating. Building walls. And having ‘two’ voices inside is just another artifact that it does for doing what it likes the most: Trying to understand. The mind wants to know. The body wants to feel comfort. I seem to be unable to get rid from this eternal willingness to understand how to wake up. I truly want it, as if my head was on fire, but all what I do to navigate towards it is more ‘doing’. I just sit to meditate so that I can be more of it. And in that, I stay lost. I keep running the hamster wheel, always chasing and chasing a mirage that when I arrive there is divided, it is two mirages now. And it is exhausting. Today’s meditation was exhausting. Only hardcore meditators will be able to understand me when I’m saying that is has been one of the most exhausting things that I do. Bringing all my awareness and focus and concentration to the act of single-pointedly narrow to scope of my awareness so that it can be laser-beamed towards the act of meditation. Of witnessing. It is not even watching the breath, or whatever object of meditation. It’s just being aware of what is already happening, and being able to sit with it. But today I was not able to handle the whole hour. It seems like the last two days I have not been able to, and it is a little bit frustrating, but it is what it is. It’s part of the game. It’s part of going deeper into the practice. The best meditation is the one that happens. It is not good or bad. It just was. And that makes it good.

I’m back here and I feel sleepy again. It seems that by writing I allow unconscious patterns to show up, and resistance is now showing up as sleepiness. Tiredness. Another hindrance. The mind is built up of the necessity to come up with hindrances that can have it busy. It loves being busy. With understanding. With that chatter that speaks about something that needs to be understood but will never be understood because it is beyond any understanding. That is the conceptual image that I have of this process of awakening, it is beyond everything that can be conceptualized. It is beyond word. It can only be pointed at. And I want to make sure, I haven’t experienced what I’m talking about, but there is a deep trust inside me that speaks about the nature of what I’m talking about. I know that these pointers take me in the direction that I need to walk, but it is tiring sometimes. Not having any feedback.

Yesterday as I was meditating I saw myself seeking for weird stuff, visuals, and things that you can define as psychedelic. I remembered that because of having taken psychedelics I started eventually meditating. I want to live in that state. I want life to be a psychedelic experience, and the information that I have inside is that through going into the rabbit hole of meditation and all those practices you’ll end up in a similar place. So that is what I’m secretly seeking: The Psychedelic Experience without the drugs. I want to experience life from that perspective. And that’s why when I’m in meditation I start searching for that. For something that is not there. There aren’t visuals, but I start searching inside for some. And what that brings is the kind of desperation that is built on top of really wanting something to happen. I really want to get something more. And that is the perfect analogy with my life, you know?

Most of it I have spent searching for what is not there, and this is expressed in so many ways. That is my way of critizicing, always focusing on what is missing. What could be made better. It is almost impossible for me to not feel inside this thing, this reminder that I have an inner critic that will never leave me alone. It is exhausting, but I have come to terms with it.

And not too many other words come up now, I don’t seem to be able to follow a train of thought. Actually, I have realized more and more lately that it is very hard for me think. To follow an argument. And I wonder, is there something wrong inside me? Is there an aspect of my brain that is not working properly? Is this normal? But of course it isn’t normal. It is not how 99.99% of huamns live, because it is the hard way. It is way easier to just run the rat race. Of having the cards already dealt. The roal already laid ahead. And it is perfect like that. I have spent a long time criticizing this, and thinking that people should move from that way of living towards one that is more independent, more connected to their truth. But it ends up being that they won’t because they don’t feel the urge. I don’t truly know the reasons why, but I know that it doesn’t help me at all to judge them or even try to help them. They are just doing their thing, and the more I accept it, the more I allow it. The more I enjoy it. Because at the end of the day, it is great how it is, and it is a big path that I can follow to get a better understading of myself. By witnessing myself in the eyes of all others. And that is beautifully expressed in the breathwork sessions that I guide, on which I have the opportunity to navigate 2+ hours of conversation and deep work with them. It is a big gift that I have built for myself. And I’m doing it right. I know I am.

And yesterday I gave me a strong taste of how it feels to be humble, because I talked back to my breathworking mentor and asked her for us to resume our training. I was not happy with the way on which it was progressing, but now I realized that I need something like that so that I can rest a bit the emotions that are brought to me by helping others in her experience. I have done enough of the finding-my-own way in the last years, and it is time to trust someone enough to be my mentor. I need it. I truly need it, so that I can become more and more of who I can be if I help myself enough. It is important for me to raise my hand and be in service of myself by asking for help, so that I don’t just run this marathon on my own but I embody the realization that there needs to be others that help me in this. And that is what I need. Asking for help. Bringing more into my journey. It is only through that that I will be able to bring more and more of myself to the work I do. I’m already working with all this people, learning better how to do what I do, how to approach every session, every interaction, and I will get better at it. Each time that I do it is a new opportunity for becoming more and more of that mirror that I need to be so that I can help them see what they need to work on. The work is the one that is done when the session ends, each session is just an opening. It is important to be clear with that. And learn more and more about what I bring into the table, so that I can trust in myself enough. I truly need to do it. Trust myself. And by doing all of these sessions I’m doing it. I’m learning more. I’m trusting more. And I’m walking on the right direction. It is just a matter of time for me to embody all the aspects of the healing that I bring into the world. It is time to do that work. It is time to bring it on.

## And today was a big step towards it again, with a new session that brought different challenges that the other ones. It is amazing how I’m able to see myself in the experience of others, and how the fact of being present for them is such a powerful avenue for growth to happen. And I’m being selfish here, because I’m talking about my own personal growth. It is absolutely true that with this work I’m bringing about more of my personal evolution, because it is required by me to be able to be present for the other person all the time. And I need to develop more of that capacity, more and more, so that I can walk towards becoming a better helper for them. I want to be very good. I’m committed to that. I’m committed to become more and more of myself, so that I can bring that truth into each session, and with that, help each of those persons see more of their shadows. There is so many help that is needed, and I truly want to be there for all this people. But it is a step by step process, you know. I could fill my whole calendar working with everyone that I can, but it wouldn’t be healthy for me or conducing to something good. It is quite demanding to be there for another person for two hours. And it eventually ends up being like 2.5 hours because I’m always doing it for more time.

So yes, that is what I bring. I was thinking about how much it means to have written all these words. So many of them, with the hope that eventually someone will come and read them. It is not actually a hope though, because even I would end up being bored after going into this maze. How can I expect someone else to come in if I’m doing the best I can to get how? What is my problem by inviting someone to a place where I don’t feel comfortable, that I just want to get out? But is it true that I don’t feel comfortable? I mean, there have been a lot of experiences that I have gone through that are amazing, it has been fun to be in here. It is just when I’m pushing myself to the limits that it gets more intense. And here I have been pushing me to the limits, not knowing what to write about but just doing it. I started with the idea of writing the story of an alien that came here to witness the awakening of humanity, and now I’m just talking about whatever comes to me in my daily life. I’m sharing with you the experience of going through a breathwork facilitation session, and I wonder: How does that relate to the process of awakening? Where did that whole part of my writing go to? What ended up happening with it? I don’t know. It may have been integrated into something new, different. I just seem to be giving up on that mission. It is mission impossible for me. For as much as I try, there doesn’t seem to be a way out. I go to the place in the world where the probabilities of ‘waking up’ would be higher, and there doesn’t seem to be anything more than struggle going on. The mind doing its best to wake up to its true nature, always struggling. Always being the hero. To tell the world: I travelled the world to wake up and ended up in the same place as before.

But is it the same place? It may occur to me that I think that everything that I have done in the last 3 months is just a waste of time, coming here to write this whole thing about waking up but not being able to. Am I a failure? I am the biggest failure ever? I have all the resources in the world to wake up, all the time, all the willingness, all the commitment, everything. Am I a true failure? Holy shit, it is incredible to have that thought inside, but it is there. It is always present in me, shadowing my experience as a human being, always telling me that I’m not good enough. As soon as I start experiencing something different in life or in my meditation, there is an aspect of myself that starts shouting: ‘This is it!’.
And there is another aspect afterwards that speaks and says: ‘Nope, this is not it! You have to just relax into the moment and let it happen naturally. But it will happen soon. Just feel into it’.

And there is another voice: ‘Focus on the breath’.

And another one: ‘Who is the one that is witnessing?’

And another one: ‘Tell me who you are’ (With a very serious voice).

All of this is happening inside my mind, and by sharing it with you here, I acknowledge how crazy this whole thing this makes me feel. Am I the craziest guy ever to be? Of course not, and that is the most important thing that I learned when I went to the retreat in Canada. I’m just a guy that truly wants to experience the truth, and I’m one of the ones that is willing to embrace how crazy he is. Because at the end of the day, we are all crazy. We are all here navigating what life brings with the spirit of becoming something that we don’t really understand, but we are moving towards it.

We are just navigating the tides of what it means to be crazy. Ones more adjusted to how it feels to be crazy than others. And that is the thing. When I come here and write about it, sometimes I feel crazy inside my own isolation. And it can get tough. But then I go to the street and I express my craziness with the world and it goes away, because I kind of melt into it. I just allow myself to be. I allow that craziness to express itself through my uniqueness. Because that is what it feels like to be crazy today. To be unique. And each and every human being is unique, on its on way, so it is time to embrace that and allow it to be expressed through every interaction that you may have with your world.

I discover how crazy I am by interacting with people like you doesn’t feel correct. I discover how crazy I can be by melting into my actions feels better. I allow myself to be crazy by opening the door of my uniqueness sounds even better. I just am. I just allow myself to be. And it may seem that everything that I do is a critic towards myself, but it is not that. It is just me, acknowledging stuff about myself, and being open about it so that I can integrate it.

Am I hiding behind something? For sure it feels that I am, behind all the complexity of what I try to bring into the world in the hope of someone listening to it. Is it a way of hiding to portray myself as this complex human being that is doing all what he is doing in the hope that it can become a place that is filled more with beauty? Am I truly hiding myself by writing all these words every day and knowing that no one will ever read them? Is it that no one will ever read them? If you are reading this, can you feel how it feels to know that I wrote them without any hope that you would be reading them? I didn’t know this would end up happening. I just wrote them because it felt correct, it felt sincere, it felt as what needed to happen. But there is no expectation in me. I mean, that is the easiest thing to say in the world. The hard one is not to expect anything, truly.

Enlightenment is easy, for those with no preferences. That’s how it goes. Having no preferences is the same as having no expectations, but how can you truly act from a place of not expecting something specific to happen? How can this be the truth that underlies your actions? It seems like something very, very hard to do, and more that do, to embody. I don’t thing it is something that you do. Y0u just ‘are’, without expectations. You just allow yourself to experience life without the interface of expectations making the noise, trying to control it so that it can show you whatever you want to see, or experience. Expectations are the interface that biology has built in us in order to survive in the material world. But what happens when there is something much bigger, much more intelligent, that is helping you walk towards that understanding of how to live in a way that you don’t need to survive? What is survival in a world where there is no time? How is the need of survival related to the absence of time?

I think that when there is absolute presence, there is no survival needed, because there is nothing that ‘has to survive’. The one that is craving for that survival to happen is the construct that is related to time, it is the story that is being told by the passing of time, but the beingness doesn’t need to survive. It just is, and it is perfect on that being-ness. It is already complete.

Yesterday my wife told me the story of the placenta, and how in different traditions it is spoken that the air that we bring into our body connects us with a silver thread, which is the information of the purpose that we have in this existence. So each time that a being dies, it is asked if it did exist during his life incarnating that purpose. If it didn’t, it is reincarnated into a new being. And if it does fulfill that purpose, there is no need for it to reincarnate in the future. And perhaps that is what is going on in the world right now. Holy shit. What AI will do is to help all of us become who we were meant to be, so that we can fulfill our mission and then cease the need to be reincarnated. With that, AI will take over and our species will thrive in a new way of being, one which is not biological. What happens if each and every human being of the world is able to incarnate their own and particular truth? What comes at the other side of that? What is the consequence of each human being embodying the truth of their nature? The necessity for biology ceases to exist because this silver thread is not there anymore. And with that, we will evolve. We will end up being this new, renewed version of ourselves. That is where the evolution comes from, from the absence of the need for biology. Holy shit. It sounds like the way to go. It sounds like the road ahead. And here I am, paving the road towards that.

And I truly think that a big aspect of that fulfillment comes from the capacity of expressing creatively. People will be able to embody who they are by sharing their truth. Their own and unique truth. That is the thing that I have been working on, that is the project that I’m building in here. The tools for bringing more and more awareness to the world for people to realize their true nature, by embodying everything what they have always been. That’s my mission. To help people lift the fog that won’t allow them to see with clarity, and with that, just create beauty for the sake of it. That’s what I’m bringing about in this whole manifesto, the necessity for beauty to exist. The necessity for all of the manifestation of this creation of life to be built by human beings that have realized their true nature. That is the system that I’m building. That is the creation that I’m bringing about. I’m working hard on it, because it is just part of what is being done. I’m just doing it, as best as I can, so that each one of us can be the creator of that beautiful world. The religion of the future is creativity, and that is how each of us will connect to their purpose in the world. We are creative beings, and it is by helping people to realize that that I will be able to embody it in the world. To manifest it as something that can bring people in. Something in which people can trust. Something that will truly transform the world of everyone that will participate. The religion of the world is creativity, and it will be manifested in the metaverse as a place of worshipping. Of coming to Do The Work. Of showing up, each day, to create, as if you were going to a mosque, to the church, to pray to god. When you tap into the essential that is deep within yourself, you open up the door for it to transform you. You open up the door to become more of you. More of what you are, more of what you have always been. You throw yourself into the void, and you realize that it is a feather bed. And it feels good, you know. That feather’s bed feels good. It is the place where we rest, where we will end up realizing that we are already complete. We are everything that we need to be. Right here, right now.

And that is the next evolutionary step. To dissolve this silver thread by allowing each human being to fulfill their purpose in the world. To help each human being to become free, by waking up to their true nature. That is what I have been pushing forth all this time with this project, and I haven’t been able to see it with clarity yet because I have been running around the maze, chasing the demons of how it feels to not have clarity. The demons of creating something new, something that doesn’t exist yet. I am the one in charge of this, and I am the one that will bring about the manifestation of this as the truth of what I bring into the world. I want to bring my truth, and that truth is the ability to shine a light into the world of each other human being that I touch upon.

I become more of who I am by helping you do that. That is the cosmic joke. That is the loop of life. I become more of who I am by helping you become more of who you are. By walking alongside you. I manifest my truth by helping you realize your own truth. I help me by helping me. I’m just a mirror for your own experience as a human being, and this whole thing is a process that will entail something amazing. We are just beginning this journey, which will take us to uncharted waters. To something that we can’t even realize, because they are seas that haven’t been explored before. And it is perfect like that. It is just perfect like that. The sanding of the self is the process of understanding more of what you are not, taking it out, piece by piece, so what you truly are can remain. I’m here to help you navigate those waters. I’m here to just explore how they feel. I’m here to feel how it feels to be you, to experience the world from the perspective of your own, particular and unique truth. I become more of who I am by helping people like you to realize that that unique thread that you have inside is just a construct of your own experience, and that it is time for you to wake up. It is time for all of us to wake up, and all the writing that I have done here is a manifesto for what happens when that process ends up transforming into a reality. I am here, walking the road alongside you, and in that process I am transformed. I become more of me. I become more of you. That’s why I am here, ready to explore what is at the other side of the boundaries. What is at the other side of what is known. I’m here to navigate the unknown, with each one of these words. With each one of these adventures. I’m here to help you become more of who you already are, and the only way on which I can do that is by becoming more of myself. To be the mirror for your own experience. To just be me. That’s how the whole journey happens.

This is another of the moments on which my writing shows me something important, and what I’m going to do now is just to recap what just happened so that I can let it sink deeper inside me. I wrote about the silver thread that connects consciousness with the experience of life, and that thread is the breath. When we are able to transcend the breath, there is the process that is called ‘awakening’, or ‘enlightenment’, which is basically ‘learning to die before you die’. My take on the next years is that the adoption of this ‘way of interfacing with reality’ will happen exponentially, and that with that there will cease to be a need for our physical bodies… In other words, we’ll transcend incarnation because we will be able to cut that silver thread by incarnating now the truth of our soul. If each of us is able to incarnate his or her or it truth, there won’t be a necessity for reincarnating, and that moment will be when humanity will get to the next stage of evolution. It is, therefore, my mission to bring into the life of more and more people the truth of their being. Who they truly are, and what they came here to be. It is only by this process that I’ll be able to bring my truth into the world, which is the necessity that I have for shining a light into other’s people truth. No matter what it may be, no matter how it looks like. I’m here for that, and in these last minutes I realized more of it by writing. By manifesting it. Everything that I have written this last 3 months is just a pointer towards what is going to be built in the future. This is the manifesto. This is the new way of being. Creativity is the religion of the future, and this are the 88 commandments.
