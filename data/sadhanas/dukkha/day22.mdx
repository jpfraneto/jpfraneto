Dukkha is about focus. Trusting enough what is inside so that the noise that comes from the outside doesn’t take that energy away. The best example for that is what just happened in me, after having an amazing meditation this morning. I decided that I would use everything that was brought up because of the meditation in service of connecting with people, so I decided to go in Twitter with that intention. To answer back to people, and connect in a meaningful way. But what ended up happening was not that, I ended up disappointed with the whole experience, and with feelings of not being enough, of not deserving attention, of being an imposter.

Everything that that brought to me was negative thoughts and feelings, and that is not what I should bring into me after a moment so important like that meditation. I need to be intentional with what I do after it, and today I was not able to do it in a way that makes sense. That is a huge learning for me. Meditation brings up the neurochemicals that produce feelings of being grounded, of being in this moment, and social media bring up the opposite. This ends up creating a chemical mess inside me, and it is not helpful for my creative process. That’s something that I need to take care of, because no one is going to do it for me. Huge learning for today.

But it is also interesting to be a witness of what was brought up, and how I feel about it. It is part of my experience, and part of who I am, so I need to watch it closely and be there for these feelings of anxiety and not being enough-ness. They are constantly brought up to me because there is a need for being useful that has not been met yet. I’m on my own void, alone, and there is a big need of connecting with people in a meaningful way. I still haven’t been able to resolve it, and I’m working on that. I’m realizing what my role is in the whole thing. I want to be there holding space for people, but I really don’t know how to do it.

Just reach out, probably. That is the thing. Reaching out and holding space for others. How can they know that I want to hold space for them if I don’t let them know? For example after the morning meditations everyone goes away and the day continues as if anything would have happened. What if I use that space as the means for a deeper exploration into what is present in the life of the other people? What if instead of putting a timer for going into Twitter for half an hour I use that time to connect with people that are in the same frequency that I am? And who can be better people than the ones that are inside that meditation room? Today we were like 15, and each one of them were there for the whole hour. Those are the hardcore meditators that I want to interact with.

I need to be more intelligent on how I spend my precious life force, and to what activities I give my energy to. I do care, I truly care, and if I go into social media and spend it there trying to care and try to catch attention just because I care too much to not do it, I will be disappointed every day because probably that is not the place for that. It is a place for entertainment, for scrolling in the timeline and being entertained by that. It is not the place for deepening the connection with other humans. I can build those connections in other places. That is my job, to better get a grasp of how the internet works and realize which is the value that I’m bringing.

I felt empty after that half an hour, and that was perfect. It is what it is. It is the information that I need to bring in so that I can better understand how I am part of that network. Actually, maybe it was a good thing to be in there for that time. Yes. Now that I better think about it, it was a good thing to experience what I experienced. Life is not about bringing only ‘good’ stuff, only ‘good’ feelings. It is about really caring for what is done. And they always speak about having 10k followers so that only 1% really care about what you do, and 1% of 10k is 100. What if I end up with a following of 100, but all of them truly care about what I do? What if that is the game that I will play? Because the content that I’m publishing is valuable. The interactions that I am building there are valuable. I just need to better understand how to play the game.

That is the thing. Learning how to play the game. Creating a system for myself. A system that can enable me to play the game in a way on which I don’t feel identified by it. There is nothing in me that brings up more anxiety than being public, and that is the game that I have to play. Being public. Bring all of those feelings into me, and don’t feel identified by them. Don’t feel that they are what I am, but just give my best, every day, so that I can just show up with what I am. Don’t pretend to be someone different. 2

I discover who I am by interacting with people like you. That is something that is always present in me. Kind of my motto for being in Social Media. Taking it seriously, and discovering more and more about myself in the process. That is the spiritual journey that is taking place. Me, interacting with other people, and sharing my voice with them. Sharing what I have learned through the words that I’m able to come up with. That is the game. And I won’t make progress in that game if I’m still hidden below my rock. Nope, that is not how it works. What works is to share myself, to open up to what is, and realize who I am in the process of being exposed.

There is people that are much more intelligent than me, and it is important to change my perspective of my interaction with them from:

- The victim mentality of ‘I will never get there’ to ‘What can I learn from them?’
- The envy mentality because of what they have achieved (and I have not) to the humble mentality of recognizing their journey and where they are at.

These are aspects of what can be brought up if I start being part of social media in a way that is productive for myself. Truly in a spiritual way, trying to connect with the message of the person that is at the other side. Not with how the message impacts me and how it makes me feel, but with how the message is built from that person’s perspective, and how I can help that person get to know herself a little bit more by diving into the reasons why they published that.

There is an underlying aspect of why every person publishes everything that they publish on SM, and it is my mission to be able to tap into that. Not how it makes me feel, but how I can help them feel who they are deeper because of what I can add to the conversation.

There is a fundamental shift in the perspective that I have had my whole life related to the use of social media and what it brings to our existence as human beings, and now is the time on which I’m better able to realize the power of it. What it truly brings.

Social media as a spiritual practice. That is the game that I’m playing, because in the act of sharing oneself there is more information that what we have been able to access ever before. If we are able to tap into this information and realize how we feel, there will be a major transformation deep within. We evolve as human beings as we are able to tap deeper into who we truly are, and in that sense, each interaction that you can have (with intention and consciousness) in social media can be the means by which you evolve spiritually. It is as if every moment can be a prompt into the question: ‘Tell me who you are’.

Who is the one that wants to laugh when she sees a TikTok video?
Who is the one that feels jealous when she sees a model on Instagram?
Who is the one that gets anxiety when there is a thread on Twitter with information that you have not been able to put into practice in your own life?
Who is the one that just wants to be entertained with Youtube videos?

What brings anxiety in the interaction of ourselves with all these platforms is the gap between where we are at now and where we want to be. There is a fundamental need inside us to belong, and if we are able to train all these platforms into our benefit, the amount of value that we can get out of that is huge. There is no limit to it. You can polish it, build with it, and from there, evolve as a human being.

We are social creatures, and that’s why all these platforms are so powerful. That’s why they have the impact that they have. And they are tools, powerful tools, and it is very important for us to realize the power that is behind them because of that. What if we stopped the doomscrooling and came in with intention? What is the intention that I have by going into Instagram today?

It is very interesting to have witnessed the power of that ad that coinbase created for the superbowl. It was only a blank screen, with a QR code. The important thing is not the ad itself, the important thing is how to transform that ad into an experience that can take the person into a journey. That is the game that we are playing here. Going into that journey with all the ones that want to come in.

And I doubt that there won’t be people that are willing to feel better from their anxiety. And I doubt that there won’t be people that want to get truly the most out of life. And that is why we need to start living with intention, to get the most out of everything with intention.

What if you had 30 minutes of Instagram each day, and you approached them with intention? Better than this. You have unlimited time on Instagram, but you’ve got to approach only 30 minutes of it with pure intention. With pure willingness to go deeper into the knowing of what you truly want, of what you truly care about. Of truly connecting with other people, without being anxious about what it brings.

That’s it. Social media as a spiritual practice. That is the game that I’m learning how to play here, and that is why I have created this whole thing now. There is no need to have new systems in place because they are all already here. Why should I make them all more complex. There is no need for it. What I have to do is frame part of what I do with intention, with pure intention to explore what is present inside me as I do it, so that I can start learning more about myself in the process.

I go into Twitter and I feel like a failure? Take time afterwards to truly feel how it feels to be a failure. Where is it in the body? What does it remind you? We have the most powerful tool of them all right here, and it is time for you to start living by it. No one will do it for me. No one will do it for you. Social media as a spiritual practice is the thing. And I will learn more about myself by being exposed to it and feeling what comes than what I will learn about myself in 1000 meditation retreats. This is what the exponential era is about. Seeing the sacred in everything, our sacred connection to ourselves. And what is more powerful than realizing that there is a perception of gap between where you are at now and where you want to be? Where does that perception come from? Who is the one that feels it? Is that really you?

That is the game that I’m learning how to play. It is all a game, and the moment on which I truly realize that and stop becoming identified by the feelings and sensations and emotions that come up when I read something that makes me feel bad, I will start becoming free.

This is the most important training that anyone can go through in this moment. We all use social media, and no one knows how to use it properly. It is time for us to learn how to do it. It is time for me to learn how to use it, so that I can share what I have learned with people and make our world a better place by helping people connect with who they truly are. Each platform is a different adventure, and in each of them there is a case to be made for you to learn more about yourself.

It is just about bringing intention into the game, and realizing that everything that arises in your experience because of your interaction with these platforms (with other people through these platforms), is the most valuable information about yourself that you can get. We live in an incredible time, and it is time to realize it and embody everything that it brings to us.

Social media as a spiritual practice. That is my new sadhana. That is the big shift, the big transformation that my soul was craving for. Each person is a creative force, and we all need to become creators in our own way. 99% of people are consumers because they don’t trust enough in what they have to share to just share it, they think that they need to research more, or just be more knowledgeable. What if we opened the door of creativity as a collective? What if all of us started sharing our voice, no matter how ‘bad’ it would be?

Here we come back into those polarities, because saying that something is bad or good is always in relationship with an expectation for it to be different from what it is. There is nothing as ‘good’ or ‘bad’. There just is. Just hit the publish button, and witness the transformation that comes to you because of that. Be a witness of all the sensations that are brought up by opening yourself to share your voice to the world, to the open void. Realize the power that lies in this opening. Realize that you are a creative force, and that life is waiting for you to embody it in any way.

That is the sadhana that Dukkha has been talking about. It is about being consistent in the sharing of what you have learned, of where you are at, without caring too much about it being ‘good’ or ‘bad’. It is about the end of shoulds, because nothing ‘should’ be different from what it actually is. This is just a construct of the mind, which loves polarities, which loves to be in a place different from where it is at right now.

But what if we all, as a collective, embraced the fact that we are all where we are at, and it is perfect as it is? What if we were able to truly embrace this and live from that understanding? I’m talking about truly embodying it. In every aspect of yourself.

And this what I’m talking about here is just about that. It is about opening the window for training yourself in a new way of using social media. In an intentional way. In the way that your soul truly wants to. We have all wanted to send that DM, or comment in that picture, and we have not been able to do it because of what they ‘could’ think. What if we truly gived a fuck about this and just opened ourselves to what comes at the other side?

What could be more powerful than realizing what we truly care about, and being a witness of how we can get more of it, and interact with the people that create that? And also be a creator ourselves. That is the game that we are learning how to play here. The consistency game. The one of trusting who you are without barriers, without problems, without anything in between.

We are deep into depression because we truly don’t understand who we are, and my deep craving is to help people get out of there. But how can they get out of there if there is not the external means for doing it? And social media is one of the things that people spend their energy the most in, so the impact that this way of doing things will have is just huge. I haven’t seen anything like this. I haven’t being able to witness what comes out of people consistently tapping into what they care about (because they follow it, and spend their energy in it), and truly feel how it feels to follow that person. Does it really resonate with who you are? Does it really tap into the depth of you? Start cleaning everything that you have been, everything that is shown to you, so that you can better understand who you are. What you care about. That is the biggest gift that you can give yourself. Training the algo in your benefit. In YOUR benefit. For your true self to shine through all the time that you spend consuming content from other people. And it is not consuming, it is interacting.

When you watch the video of a creator, you are just having a conversation with her. She just doesn’t know it. But if you open up the possibility for that communication to truly start, by opening yourself to share with her what the content truly brought up to you, how it made you feel, there will be a transformation inside you that will be very powerful.

Something will be changed. Something will be shifted. That is the game that we are playing here. That is what is going to change humanity and the relationship that we have with ourselves. The intention for it to change. That is why there won’t be a magical dwarf that will come up with his wand and change everything overnight. Nope. We’ve got to Do The Work. Together. We’ve got to realize how the world on which we live works, and live from there.

Script:

Welcome to a new day of Social Sadhana. I want to invite you to close your eyes for a while, and connect to that aspect that is deep within you and that just wants to play. It just wants to be connected to people with which it resonates, and this moment is an invitation for that. It is an invitation for you to connect with what you care about, what you trust, what you feel, and be open to be the means by which more of that comes into the world.

And now I want to invite you to open up your eyes, and go into the social media platform of your choice. May it be TikTok, or Youtube, or Twitter, or Instagram. It doesn’t truly matter, the important part of it is that you like it. Go in there, and start consuming content with intention. As you see a video, or an image, or a tweet, take a bit of time to truly feel how it feels inside you. Do you resonate with what it brings or those sensations are just an automatic response to what you are craving for in your own life? Is it helping you to make progress towards where you want to be?

Take a moment to connect with what is present in your whole system, and because of that, decide how you are going to progress from here. Will you unfollow that person because you don’t like what you see? Will you comment something so that that person knows that there is someone watching, someone that truly resonates with what is being witness? How does it help you on your own path? How are you different after having seen this?

Take a moment to be mindful of everything that is brought up in your experience. Enjoy it, enjoy the casquade of chemicals that is present in your body right now, and move on. If you forget to do this process, it doesn’t matter. We are just training ourselves here to become more mindful, and it won’t happen overnight. We are training ourselves, and it will take time. But each moment that you spend doing this, is the most valuable gift that you can give you in your life. The amount of time that is spent mindlessly scrolling through social media is huge, and by taking this mindful time to do it differently you are truly changing the history of humanity, just by changing your own history.

I’m sure that over time there will be a big shift in yourself, and that shift will be brought because of the different way on which you will approach your interaction with this platform that you chose. Maybe next time you will take a little time to answer back. To comment. To reach out. Maybe you’ll unfollow that person that doesn’t truly add value to your experience. Maybe nothing will change at all, but always remind you that there is something that is changing, because you are acting differently than before.

The algorithms of all these platforms is just amazing, it is a miracle, and if you start having a good relationship with it your whole life will change. Your whole perspective of what it means to be alive in this moment will be transformed, and you will start to become free.

Free from the unconscious patters of action that have you in this mindless consumption of content, just for the sake of adding noise to your experience as a human being.

Free to open up to truly feel how it feels to be anxious, alone, desperate, lost.

Free to truly experience how it feels to not know where to go. You are not alone.

Free to express how you felt. The creators are waiting for it.

Free to just be yourself. We are all special, we are all unique.

Free to share your gift with the world. That specific gift that only you have inside, and that is waiting to be shared with every human being that is alive.

Free to enjoy. Free to be. Just be. We all came here to do that.

But you’ve got to do the work first.

Bringing people out of social media is not about creating new means for them to entertain themselves outside it. The only way in is through. The only means for evolving from where we are at now is by using these tools to deepen our relationship with ourselves. That is the way. They are too addictive to be forgotten, to addictive for any alternative to be built. It needs to be a process that is done mindfully, by each person that is part of them, by just showing up. Every day. To do what they have always done, but with a slightest touch of mindfulness in every scroll. In every interaction. Maybe have a diary next to you, a notebook. How do you feel watching the post of X?

What does it bring into your life?

How do you feel when you share how you feel? What does it bring to your experience?

Social media as a spiritual practice is something new, it is a new way of existing, which is built over the sense that each of us has something unique to share. And each of us is a unique spark of light. Let’s make it shine, through each and every one of us.
