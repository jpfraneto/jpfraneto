The biggest transformation that awakening will bring into my life is to be able to not take myself too seriously. Each time that I start a new writing session I open up the recording and there is a bubble in the corner of my screen on which I can see my face. I am there, writing once again, with my green necklace hanging from my neck. The one that has been with me through many adventures. The one that was gifted to me in Universo Paralello, a transformational festival in Brazil, by a woman that I still carry in my heart. She was at all accounts what in our society would be called ‘weird’. Full of tattoos, full of piercings, full of movement, full of flow. She was small, skinny, and full of energy. We were dancing along each other, she was with her boyfriend, an Argentinian that was even weirder than her. I loved that. I felt comfortable. I gave them some food and had a small conversation each time that we saw each other. What we exchanged the most was smiles. And she gave me this rock as a present, because she was able to see my heart. She knew me less than most people that know me but she knew more about me than most of them. And she recognized me in this rock, gave it to me as a present, and it has been travelling life with me since then. I’m very grateful for it. It is an eternal reminder of my truth, of that truth that I have been searching for below every rock that I’m able to lift, and it has been staring at me since the dawn of time from all the places where I’m able to look at. The truth is looking for me as much as I’m looking for it. It is time to refine the way on which I’m searching for it. Or maybe stop searching at all. But how can I stop the search? What on earth will enable me to stop searching once and for all and begin to realize that everything that I’m searching for is already staring at me from closer than close? It’s just that maze of the mind that won’t allow me to see, to experience, to explore. I’m here, just deep into that maze, and not realizing that the way out comes from being able to stop time. To stop the illusion. And I’m so good at blaming myself for not being able to do that, without having into account that it is probably the hardest thing in the world to do as a human being. I have been many lifetimes coming to this place of realizing my true nature, and this is the one on which I say: I’m done with the suffering. That’s why this whole writing started, you know? The biggest resonance that I found in that retreat that I went to participate in Canada was that. Dukkha. The endless suffering. I’m done with it. It is enough. I just want to be free. So how can I be free? That’s the million dollar question.

What makes sense as a means for answering it right now is just exploring what it brings to myself as a matter of being in service. What is it that I want in my life? How do I want to live? I’m at a point on which I can decide how I want to live. What do I want to bring. Today is a very important day, because I start this program called nights and weekends. I’ll be in there exploring how to build something that did not exist before, and in that, I’m going to have the opportunity to walk towards my dreams with the help of other amazing human beings. So, what do I want to bring into the world? What is my mission?

I will outline down here points that can help me walk towards that answer…

- I know that what I will do will have inside the spirit of David Foster Wallace. He is the person that I will honor with everything that I will do. His legacy. The fact that he ended up taking away his life because he was not able to deal with the depression that he had.
- Depression. That is a major thing in the work that I will do. I want to help people that are going through episodes of depression.
- Creativity. I want to build a temple for creativity. The religion of the future. The thing that I want to create is a place where creativity is pushed forth by everything that happens in there.
- What I will build is a mix of IRL and the metaverse, or web 3 or call it how you want. I want to have a place where NFTs are connected to what is going on in there.
- I want to create the most amazing network of offices in the world. I remember when I was younger and we went with my friends to a chain of hostels called Loki (I think that was the name) in Peru, and it was awesome. I want to build a network of places like this, and I want to create the first one. I feed myself with the interaction with other people, and I want to have a place in the downtown of the place where I live, a place on which I can hang out with people outside, having a bench on which we can seat and have a cool conversation. This place will be a social center in my town. I remember when I was in Stari Grad (Croatia) and I was just walking around looking for a cool place and I ended up finding a guy that seemed nice and I asked him: “Where should I go?” Without any doubt, he sent me to the coolest place in town: The music store. In there I had some of the best conversations I had in my whole trip with the guy that was there: Leo. He is an inspiration for me, and that is the kind of energy that I want to bring into my town. The one of the joy of interacting with other human beings.
- Inside the office there are going to be 4 hours of mandatory deep work. I don’t know what it will be about yet, but it is going to be an integral part of what is going to happen there. The person that will hold the space for the office is going to be in charge of doing this, day after day, and with that, he/she/it will add value to the world by doing the important work. If that person has a full time job, it is ok. It’s part of it. And then, as I wrote that, I realized that it is limiting. Why would I limit what this person would do? Which are the minimum requirements for that person to be part of this network of offices? How do I envision this in the future? What comes to mind as I ask myself that question is something like the B Corp label, or certification. For becoming a B Corp you needed to fill a thing with a lot of requirements, or commitments, or stuff. How is that going to play out in this case?
- Education. The person that is in charge of the office will need to be a very active part of the community, and offer education from there. Maybe once per week bring people in who want to talk about web3 and which are the implications of it for society. We can have those talks throughout the world, and let people understand better what is the role of what they are doing by just showing up for it. Listening to people. And then the feedback of people will be a very valuable input for the whole ecosystem, because the kind of people that will participate in these education sessions is the kind of people that are not active on the internet. Maybe. And the input of them is very valuable to realize how to evolve this whole thing.
- The office will have a very big TV and good sound system, and each day, at 20:00pm, it will play the film of the day. I’m very convinced that in films there is a lot of information related to human nature, to how we relate to society and to ourselves, and I’m sure that by doing a quality choice of what will be displayed in the network there will be something important happening here. It will have a strong impact. This is a dream that I have always had, and the idea is to choose randomly from all the people that support the project one that goes to see the film every day.
- The office will have a system that will enable the door to be open by a person that holds a particular NFT, which will be the ticket for each film of the afternoon. This is part of the technological system that I need to develop, and a question that comes with this is: How can I connect the scanning of an NFT to the lock that opens the door? How can automate this process so that the person that comes every day has the NFT and it can only open to the one that has it in his/her wallet? At the beginning this doesn’t need to be automated, but in the long term the idea is to have everything automated. The idea of this whole project is that there are no fixed costs more than the rent of the place, and the expenses of running it (electricity, internet, etc). These are the only costs, and there won’t be a person that is there waiting for people to come. This will lower the costs of having this place dramatically, because everything will be automated and scaled for every place like this in the world. I want to invite you to picture one thing: There is 100 places like this in the world. In different places, small, big, populated or empty. There is no need for something specific, people from all over the world can participate. That is the beauty of it. And each one of this places will be the office for one amazing human being, which will be the community gatherer of that village, city, etc. So each time that someone of the network goes somewhere else in the world, she knows that there is a place where she will be welcome. And from there, we can start exploring what comes. We can start exploring what is at the other side. We can start gathering cool people that are willing to bring nice stuff into their community. I think that is what is needed right now. Using the power that the internet has for connecting people to help our local communities. Being an active part of the internet, but also a very active part in our local community. Just with that we will be able to transform the way on which we work as a society. Most of the problems that we have right now in society are because of a bad distribution of the resources that we already have, and in that sense, this is a big aspect of that. We can transform it by opening the door of having places like this everywhere. There is nothing like this until now. And it is absolutely possible. I know that there may be people that will think that it is a waste of money to rent an office like this, but I am one that doesn’t think like that. I am commited to that worldview, that one that makes me think that something like this is possible. I’m eager to try it out, and it has been in my heart for a long, long time.
- I’m wondering if this place is directly connected with the use of psychedelics. Something that comes to me is the idea that I have had since a long time related to the cannabis ice cream. In many senses, cannabis is a stepping stone towards the psychedelic experience, and I would love to have something like this as the guideline of what is done here. What if each of these places is that, a place where you come to get your brain opened? What if this is a place for brain surgery? Mind surgery. That’s the thing. We do mind surgery. We open it side by side and with that we explore what happens at the other side. And I’m here exploring what happens at the other side. Bringing it into life. What is present in me right now is the store that there is in my town where they sell duck toys. If you were to think if something like that would be possible, it would probably be a bad idea, but there it is, and it is great. It still exists. This speaks to me about the need that there is in society for something new, something novel, and I’m here to explore what that means. What is at the other side of that exploration. I don’t know yet. Maybe what I’ll do is just have a collection of NFTs and sell reproductions of it. Maybe this thing is an NFT museum. Maybe it is something that evolves year after year. What if the NFT museum is the wallet that I create for this project? What if that wallet is connected to what is going to happen with this project? Holy shit, it is so hard to focus my ideas, they are all over the place. I started writing this outline so that I could realize which is the thing that I want to build, and I ended up here.
- Now what comes to mind is related to The Open Source Factory. What if each one of these places is just a landmark on which those projects will start to take place. What if each owner of the store is just the captain of that project? What if this is the place where he gathers the people that will participate in it? What if eventually there are 50 places like this in the world and they all participate in a round on which they build one project every month and with that they participate in a worldwide contest? I’m here, realizing which is the way on which this whole thing will work, and exploring which are the possibilities that exist. I don’t know. It is infinite. The capacity of imagination that I have is infinite, and I’m trying to shrink it into something that can be transformed into a reality but I deeply know that anything that I come up with can eventually be transformed into a reality. It is just a matter of dreaming. How can I decide the next steps? Which are those next steps? I don’t really know. I’m here to explore them. That’s why I started with this whole outline, so that I could bring that into life. But I truly don’t know how to do it, you know. It is hard. It is very hard for me. I don’t seem to be able to organize, to come up with the process. I’m just full of loose ideas that run through my mind, but not knowing which are the ones that I need to materialize so that I can make some progress. What comes to mind is the necessity of each store (I need to come up with a better name for these things, but for now, lets’ go with store) to have an economic activity in the place where it is at. Everywhere in the world there are stores, and it is completely possible for a random person to start one. What it will sell? I don’t know. I need to study it. I need to just start the first one. That’s the thing. I need to start. I need to get the first store and start building it, creating it, manifesting it. But it is not a store, now you remember? It is an offices network. It is the network of the coolest offices in the world, run by the coolest people. Why would you want to have a solo office in the downtown part of the place on which you live? Why would you want to give energy to something like this? Because it would create community. It would transform you into someone that adds important value to the place on which you live. And that is very valuable. That is something that can change the world. Step by step. Community by community. And eventually, I don’t need to create something as big as what I’m thinking of at the beginning. I can just start with the first one. That’s the thing. I’m thinking about the castle and I haven’t even put the first stone. How can I truly understand which is going to be the scale of this thing if I’m not even able to put the first stone? That’s what I need to do. Put the first stone, and truly realize if this is a good idea. Understand what it takes, what it brings, and from there, explore those possibilities. And I don’t need to spend a shitload of money, I can just start doing it in the office that I have now. I can start small. Explore from there. That’s the thing, I’m thinking about this big thing but it is not necessary yet. I can start from where I am at, placing the first stone and then evolving from there. This is a behavioral pattern that arises a lot in my life, which is related to the complexity that I need to create so that I can feel comfortable. And where is that comfort coming from? Why do I need to elaborate in such a complex way so that I can feel comfortable with it? What is what goes on inside me that calls for this complexity in such a big way? I wonder that, and in that wondering there is an exploration to be made. Because I’m bringing all this novel things, and I’m forgetting a big part of this. I’m a person that wants to bring healing into the world. I want to help people. And I’m forgetting that, because I’m bringing all this complexity before having in mind a basic aspect of what I do. I’m building division, inside myself, because I’m designing this whole thing without having in mind the capacity that I have for helping people. I started with this idea of depression, thinking about this whole thing, and now is the time on which I can develop it a bit more. What if every one of these stores has one person every month that goes there to just create for 4 hours? What if that person is working with me so that she can feel good, and from there, come out of the state on which she has been until now? What if we do a deep work, one that can transform the way on which she experiences reality? What if each month is a manifesto of the way on which that person can be healed? What if this is the infinite jest? What if each one of this places will be a testament for the end of depression? What kind of network can be built from there? The word depression needs to be taken into account. It is the work of my life. I’m here to work with depression, to feel it, to embody everything that it brings, so that from there, you can evolve. I’m here to help you evolve. I’m here to help you become more of who you already are. A hospital for helping people that are depressed costs a lot of money. What if this is the answer? What if we are here just helping each other, holding each others hands? What if each one of this offices in this world is a temple for creativity? That is the thing. These are temples for creativity, and what I have been building this whole time is just an exploration into what it means to be yourself. Creativity is the means by which you connect with yourself, and in that, become more of who you already are. That’s the exploration that I’m at. Since I started writing this book I have been focused in the consequences of creating transformational journeys that can change people’s lifes. Each one of these places is going to be a cocoon, and in that, I’m going to help each human being that I work with evolve. The prize of the store will be paid by that human, by the people that will support her, by the community. This is going to be something that has such a big impact in the world that we won’t be even able to realize it until after it happens. We are going to do deep work. We are going to be transformed. We are going to evolve. Together. That is what has been being manifested through me this whole time. That is the thing with these transformational journeys. I did not know how to implement them, how to bring into the equation the mixture of a transformational music festival and a meditation retreat, but now this is a clear answer that comes. This is the way. This is the path forward. This is the exploration that needed to come, and in this exploration, there will be a transformation that will happen. To transcend depression, you need to embody every aspect of who you are. You need to become everything that you are, with the doubts, with the pains, with everything that is in there. It is all information that will help you become who you came here to be. I’m sure that what is at the other side of depression is enlightenment, and I’m sure that this is the road forward. I’m sure about it. I’m sure that the future needs us to unleash creativity, and I’m here for that. It is not about the person that will be there forever, it is about the person that will be there every month. And that person will hold the hand of the one that comes afterwards. And with that, this journey of exploration will come into being. That is the magic of this thing. This is what comes. This is the next stage of my own evolution, manifesting this into being. I have been writing the manifesto for this thing for 81 days now, and it is finally coming into clarity. I am finally understanding what is going to be built by me. I’m finally getting it. I’m finally becoming more and more of myself by opening the door to transform my world. By opening to be who I came here to be. I’m just here, with all of what I have. I’m here, being myself, exploring everything that that entails. I’m here, witnessing what happens at the other side. Being at the other side. Experimenting with it. Becoming it.

Time to get out from the bulleted point thing and into a free flow. I mean, that was just what I was doing before, but now I’m doing it with more clarity. For me, freedom brings about clarity, and that is the exploration that I’m going to go in with this new way of doing things. The new old way of doing things. The clarity that is brought from not having a particular thing to say, just allowing what wants to be manifested through me to be manifested through me. That is the work that I’m doing. That is the starting point. That is the entrance point. I’m going to do my thing, to explore my thing, so that I can let what comes come. Let what goes go. But it will stay here. Everything that I have written -except for those days on which I mistakenly erased everything- is here, somewhere, for me to explore someday. This manifesto is the exploration of the work of my life. This is what I will bring into the world to transform it. To help us become. Transformational Vessel. That is the thing. Each one of these projects will be a transformational vessel, and the person that is in each one of them will be a in a deep journey. Into herself. Into her reality. Into her own and particular life experience, so that she can gather all that life experience and just let it free through the act of creation. That’s the thing. That is what this whole thing is about. Erasing any kind of constraint, and allowing what needs to be just to be. Allowing what needs to become to become. Allowing what it means to be human to be manifested through each one of our actions. We are gods, and in the act of creation is where we connect to that. Each thing that will happen in these TV is an exploration into what it means to become more of who you already are. Of what you have always been. So I want to create a story, one that will try to describe what this thing is about.

So this story is about a little girl called Maria. She is unhappy. She doesn’t know what to with her life. She knows that she wants something new, something different, but she does not have a clear understanding of what that is. She is just there, having time pass through, next to her, and exploring what it brings. Maria is in a state of despair, helpless, without hope for her future. So one day she discovers about a program called Timeless Integration, and she decides to apply. She realizes that there is a TV near to where she lives, and decides to give it a try. So she applies and eventually she gets chosen, and with the money of all the people that applied they are able to pay for the rent of the thing. So she eventually has money for doing her thing. The whole community supports her in her journey of becoming more of what she already is. So the mission that she has is just to show up, every day, except Saturdays, to Do The Work. Show up for 4 hours to Do The Work. This is what will entail the transformation. This is what will mutate her into something new. And this is all the time she has. At the beginning, she starts with a clear idea, and the only thing that is clear is that she has to work in what she said she would work. If it is starting her own business, let it be, but she needs to work just on that. If it is writing a book, let it be, but it needs to be just on that. It doesn’t matter what it is, but this whole thing will be a magnifying glass for her focus. It will show her what she is capable of, by giving her the space to express her whole being through the act of creation. So Maria is accepted, and the first step in the process is a session with a big dose of psilocybin. In the day of the full moon. This is when it starts. This is the first step. I will be holding her hand there, accepting everything that comes as part of what needs to come. And from there, she will have to show up every day. And once every week to a breathwork session. I mean, the specifics of the program are not clear yet, and it can evolve over time, but this is the thing. Creating containers for people to be transformed. Allowing these to be the chrysalis that will end up transforming the way on which these people relate to their own reality. Just by allowing themselves to become free in the creative act. This is going to be the most important month of their life. If they can take a month of vacation in their job, that is the most important thing that their job can offer them, because the impact that this will have in the way that she works is going to pay off by thousands. This is something that managers should support as the most important investment that they can give to their workers. And if not, there is always the opportunity to quit. To start a new life. There is a big aspect of this thing related to trust, and in that trust, it is important to allow it to happen. These TVs are going to be spaces that will transform the world, one person at a time. The world doesn’t change because there is something that comes out that changes it, it changes because individuals change. And this is the most important way on which they will change, just by allowing them to explore, to be themselves. To give them a place where they can be themselves. To explore what it means to be themselves. I had not realized the power of this until now, and places like this will start growing as mushrooms all over the world. And I’m thinking about getting my overdeed on the otherside and eventually that being the place where all this people gather. They will all be part of this thing, and they will have an entrance into that just by being who they are. Just by becoming more of who they already are. This is the thing. This is the exploration. This is the becoming. I haven’t realized it yet, but it is time for it. It is the thing that is wanting to be manifested through me, and all of what I have been doing all this time is making this happen. Without even knowing it. And now it is clearer. Because of this writing it became clear. You were just witness of something that will change the world. Thank you for reading. Thank you for being who you are. This is everything that I am. With my green necklace that reminds me that. With my face that I’m watching from the outside as I become amazed by what is. This is all what is. Welcome to the new world.
