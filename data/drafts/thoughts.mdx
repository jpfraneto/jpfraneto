Lex: How do you maintain peace of mind when an interview is going to a place different from where you wanted it to? Is there a particular path that you envision the conversation going to beforehand?

Grimes: If the meaning of life is that we are the manifestation of the universe making itself conscious of its own existence, what is the role that creativity plays in that manifestation? What is the purpose of the creative act itself?
