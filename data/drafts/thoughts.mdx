Lex: How do you maintain peace of mind when an interview is going to a place different from where you wanted it to? Is there a particular path that you envision the conversation going to beforehand?

Grimes: If the meaning of life is that we are the manifestation of the universe making itself conscious of its own existence, what is the role that creativity plays in that manifestation? What is the purpose of the creative act itself?

What is more present in me after listening to this episode is the act of podcasting itself, and what does it mean as an expression of the interaction between two human beings. I remember parts of the episode on which Grimes spoke about herself being 'underqualified' for being there, and she spoke about what the listener is expecting from the conversation. Should it be fun? Should I be entertained by every part of it? Should every part of the conversation be a meaningful one that I can write down for further reference?

Lex's answer completely got the point. It is not about that. After listening to this episode I have a clearer understanding that podcasting is about shining a light into the human aspect of the character that is behind the microphone. For me at least it feels impossible to be able to 'fake' in this circumstances -it would be a major challenge for my whole being-, and I guess that for most sane people it would be like this. So being in the podcast is for people to be discovered in the conversation, and listening to Grimes talk was great because of that. It is very important for me to learn more about humans, and listening to a person as she is, a reference for so many, is very enlightening.

There is so much happening in the back of the life of people that are successful. This is such a recurrent pattern. They tend to be very dedicated to what they do, or passionate, or whatever makes them shine. The way that she spoke about books, about this particular one, or that particular one, is very exciting. It speaks to me about how much is behind the art that she creates, about everything that she creates really. I was touched also with her talking about being a mother, and how life changing that is. It is very important for me to listen to another mom and her experience, to realize that each one of them has a particular journey, and all of them deserve respect. There is so much to learn if I leave aside the expectations of how it should be and I open myself to the understanding of why it is how it is. With anyone. And listening to this episode brought me closer to that understanding.

It is also present in me right now that listening to this podcasts is like an act of shining a light in the process. Each one of them is a long journey to discover, but as I go through that with consistency, with care, there seems to be something that is shown in my consciousness about that. I begin to connect with how the interviewer thinks, how he feels, and that connects me in a different way to the whole process. There is all this body of knowledge that is being unleashed because of the work that he is doing with such influential people, and this for me is a huge opportunity to discover more how the world works. How the human mind works. This can be discovered listening to any person in the world talk, we all have our magic, but the nice part about this show is that there is people here that are expremely passionate about what they do. I guess that that is the big difference. The ammount of love and passion that goes inside the life of each person that goes through the journey of these conversations. There is a lot of magic in there.

The last thing that I want to write about is the neuroplasticity of listening to different kinds of music. That is something that was not in my mind, but now it makes sense. There is a big aspect of empathy in the process of listening to music that I don't like, because it was created and produced as the means of expression of a human being. There is something behind it that is that human being shining on her own individuality, on her own life path, and the fact that I close myself to that experience limits my enjoyment of what being a human being is. If I listen to different kinds of music I open myself to what that person had inside when she created that piece. Why would I leave myself out of that party?
