Lex: What is the consequence of the foundation of Qualcomm in the history of humanity?

Cristiano: How far are we from the point on which the connectivity technology is being limited only by the laws of physics?

What is present for me after listening to this episode is a deep curiosity that points my awareness towards the point where we are at right now as a species. Having twitter being bought by Elon, having all this connectivity that is being deployed and available, having the opportunity for the source code of the things that command our society being open for scrutiny of every human being, it brings me hope. As we make the conscious decisions that will enable the drive of economy towards a place of good. Of trust. Of love. It makes me anxious to have so many open opportunities for my efforts to go to, and I also wonder how can I best use my time so that I can be as good as I can in what I do. And what is what I do so that this comes into my actions. That is a big question, because as Cristiano answered to one of the last questions, he strives for living in the present. That is the meaning of life. To experience it in the present. Only by that action can be aligned with purpose, and with that the capacity of being the best version of myself is unleashed. May it be as a software engineer. May it be as a barteneder. The only limit is within my experience of reality. And I'm under control of that. I'm responsible for it.

Thank you Lex for the amazing work that you do. I still don't know how to fit listening to every episode that you publish in my life, but it is one of my most important goals right now. Is there any periodicity with the episodes that I can use as the means with which I organize myself? Or should I always be with time available for doing it? How would my life looked like if I was providing to each member of it and at the same I was able to make this kind of decision? Sounds quite interesting. That's where I will move to. Sounds like a good path. Thanks for reading, Oliver, you are always there.
