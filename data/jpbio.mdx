- working my way into living in full presence so that i can do my best work in every aspect of my life
- Using my lens of reality as a means of making sense of everything that comes into my awareness. This is how I refine my voice, consuming content with intention. Filtering what made sense, and coming up with something that makes me act in a different way at the other side.
- I have spent the last years of my life building up my CHARACTER, not my resume, so that I can share with the world the best of who I am.
