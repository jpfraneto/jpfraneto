Alex,

What I feel after this conversation with you is a deep sense of gratitude and admiration for the path that you have walked in your life, that has brought you to the point where you are at now, with a business that you started out of passion, with a growing family with Allison, and with a morning routine that helps you establish your actions into who you are. Into what you want to bring into the world.

One of the things that I carry with me after this conversation is about being the best version of yourself, and how being consistent with what you do every day as you wake up helps you to bring this understanding. You spoke about this being the only predictable aspect of your day, and it showed me a lot of the power of this kind of ritual. I have been travelling this path of building a routine for a long time now, and the conversation with you helps me to dive into the **why** of doing it. More than the **what**. What I will do will evolve, it can change over time, and it is part of the iteration process of being alive. But the **why** represents a much deeper aspect of the self. It is about reflecting on the things that I have in my life, and how those things are aligned with who I want to be. I will have all this in mind to evolve what I do every day into something that is more representative of the life that I want to live.

Another aspect that comes to mind as I write this recap is about the motivational videos that were the catalyzer of the big changes of your life. Or more than the big changes, they are the wood that kept the fire going, the ones that made you feel strenght when the circumstances were low, and the ones that made you arrive towards were you are at. This is very important to have in mind for me, because it speaks about the necessity of reaching out for help. Using the wisdom of the ones that have walked before you and leveraging that wisdom in your own experience so that you can make progress. A motivational video every day keeps the heart on fire. I will have that in mind.

As you started presenting the album talking to your brother my whole body was full of energy, feeling every word with my heart. The fact that you grounded us into the experience talking to someone that is not physically here makes me connect with the timeless aspect of music, which trascend time and space. Every time in the future that I listen to this album I will have in my mind his smiley face, as you were recalling those stories of old, on which he arrived to your house with this album on his hands. How memorable those moments are, and how eternal they will be. The fact that you started our conversation talking to him speaks to me about what I want to bring into this space. What this is all about. I deeply appreciate you for this.

I felt weird at times because I did not know what questions to ask so that I could 'get the best out of our time together', but that is a huge aspect of the learning process. This is only my sixth time sitting down and talking to another person in this environment, and I will keep evolving time after time. I'm grateful for this opportunity of sitting down with you. I resonate a lot with your life story, and I learned a lot in our time together.

Thank you a lot brother, I wish you the best.
