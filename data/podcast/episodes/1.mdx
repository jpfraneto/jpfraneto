Talking with Tyler Williams (https://tylerwilliamsmusic.com/) about the importance that this piece has had in his life, and finding out why this is the one that he would take to the other side.

This was the kick off of this adventure, with a person that was also part of The Podcasting Workshop, a place that Akimbo created to educate people like me into what Podcasting means. For me, it is about finding my voice in the world, and being trustworthy of it enough so that I can share it. I'm publishing this on the 9th of march of 2022, almost 8 months after recording it. Imagine how hard it is for me to share who I am with the world, that I haven't made any effort to push this project forward.

But it is time to do it. I don't remember too much of this conversation, I remember that it went smoothly, I felt comfortable, and we talked about music and life. As it should be. It was great. I'm happy to share it with you.
