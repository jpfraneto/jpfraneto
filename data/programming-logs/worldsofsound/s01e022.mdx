Yiaaaaju. Starting a new project. I had doubts on what project I would build in this time, but I ended up focusing on this one because I want to work integrating the API's from youtube, spotify and soundcloud. I want to see how they behave, and what is behind each of them so that I can practice my skills working with third party API's. This is a very important part of webdev, and I'm sure that I'll learn a lot training here. This first session was all about building the foundations of the project, which will be built with NextJS. The first dependency that I installed was next-auth, and my aim with it is to build user profiles that save the music of the people that are signed up, so that I can see through all the person's recommendations in the particular platform and listen music from there. I think this will be interesting. It was a great start, and I'm happy that I commited to a project and just started building it, with webpage and everything.
