Closing an amazing week, on which I was able to work full power with a lot of focus and with a sensation of making progress that makes me feel great. I did not have this feeling before, and it is awesome. I'm excited to learn more about the tools that I'm using so that I can approach the building process in a new way and add new features, but for now I'm going great. There have only been 8 days in this project and I feel that it is in a place that is great. I'm looking forward to the moment when I'll be able to use it to store my videos and comments about them. It will be a repository of knowledge that I will share with the world, and it doesn't matter if no one uses it, because I'll be doing it and that is what will drive success, because I'll know how to fix it and what I could have done better. The open source factory is more active than ever, and now I'm going to practice my react skills in other projects so that I can learn more about react in a different envirnoment. It is important for me to do it this way, so that I can gather new perspectives.

I feel focused.
