I keep with the great feelings while sitting down to code. Today was a session that I started right after a powerful session of breathwork in the morning, and it felt great. I pushed through the problem of adding the option to have a user's playlist for a determined day, which is a feature that I'll add so that I can erase the 'having to make the decision of what music I listen in that particular work session.'

That is going to be a story from the past, since I'm adding that feature in this project. I'm facing some challenges related to how to build this into the system, but I'm sure I'll be able to jump through them as I make the progress that I have to make. I'm learning a lot about how to use react in the process, and getting a lot of training in it.
