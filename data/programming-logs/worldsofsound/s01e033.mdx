Yesterday I went to bed with an incredible amount of information in my brain related to how to progress with this project, and today I was implementing a big part of that information working with the functionality to add a scheduled day. This means that tomorrow I'll come to work with the list of music that I'll play ready, and that will free my mind from having to search for it before starting the session. I will just jump into it. It feels interesting to have done this progress, and tomorrow I'll see how it goes.
