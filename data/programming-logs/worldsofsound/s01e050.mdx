I'm finishing this project with the sensation that the last days of work I have been much messier than before. That brings up a lot the inability that I have had to create a constistent way of doing the work. I have done it, I have made a lot of progress by creating this app, but I have not been able to be consistent. The best way to measure that will be the graph on which I will see the length of each session on this last sprint of the open source factory. It has been a great challenge for me to create this consistent way and also manage my life, and that is expressed on this lack of rythm. But that is a consequence of me prioritizing other things also. For example, today I woke up at 4 am and my daughter was awake until 6.20, so I came back to sleep at that time and woke up at 8.30, to go to the cold shower and then to do my kundalini yoga class (instead of doing my coding session right away). I prioritized my ky class than the programming session, and the fact that I just did 68 minutes today is a consequence of that. But I feel good, because it meant a lot for me to deal with my tendency to be in a hurry and wanting to do other things, and just be doing what I'm doing in that moment. That is my main challenge in this moment, and I'm excited about where it will go. My whole yoga practice, and everything that is part of my domain of action right now is moving me towards that space, on which I will be able to live more and more in the present, and with that give more of my full self into whatever I'm doing.

I feel very excited about what is at the other side of this whole adventure, and today was an important stepping stone towards that. Dealing with only being able to code for such a short time brought important things to my consciousness, and I'm grateful for my willingness to deal with them. I also had my second session of the connection course on which I'm learning to communicate better, and that is a great thing. I'm doing progress in every avenue. Today was a good day. I also went to a bar and socialized with other people. It was great.
