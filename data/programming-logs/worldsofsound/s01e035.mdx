Today I started building an implementation for the Spotify api, inspired by a great page that I found called Dubolt (https://dubolt.com/) which uses the API to build recommendations of music for the user. The interesting part of it is that you can work with the user's information. It is also very interesting to see the difference on which the different API's are built, and how they behave. There is a lot of information in this project that if I'm able to tap into I'll make a difference, build something interesting, and learn more about how this whole thing works.
