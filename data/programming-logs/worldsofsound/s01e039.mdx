Coming back to work after a rest day yesterday that I spent with my family. The session was good, with a kind of fog that I have in my mind because the last days I have gone through intense periods of eating a lot, specially sugar, which I was not used to lately, so I have felt kind of weird and out of balance. But it has been interesting to witness this, and try to think what is it about. The programming today was OK, I worked in a route of the website on which I want to be able to show the music that a person has shared so that we can listen to it and follow that person. I don't think it will be too useful because there is no possibility of bringing it from soundcloud to the app, and the UX will be weird because the person has to copy the link and then paste it in the app, which is never a good UX because it is hard to explain and understand. But I'm working my way through the understanding of what this app will be about, managing my way through it.
