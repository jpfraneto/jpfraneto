Parrrapapapapapapapapa, this has been an interesting day, on which I woke up without too much motivation of pushing forward. It has been crazy intense to be aaaaall this time working without any feedback, and today was a day on which it was hard for me to find the strength needed to push. But my partner was there helping me, and she helped me get up and running. I did a lot of meditation, yoga nidra and kundalini yoga in the morning, to come afterwards into a work session that helped me to understand where the project is going now. It is very non-organized because I don't really know what I'm doing, but it seems that it is heading towards being a place where I will be able to review content from spotify, soundcloud and youtube. It is very important for me to reflect on the content that I consume, and this website is an answer to that need. I'm happy of having done the work again, without wanting to do it.
