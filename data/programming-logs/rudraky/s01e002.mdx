Dia 7. New day playing around with this thing, on which I arranged back the mess that I made yesterday with the way that the kriyas information was accessed. Now the data structure is much easier to understand, as the kriya is just an array of different exercizes, which makes it easier to move from one to the next one in the UI. I made some good progress, with some styling that is not good but tomorrow Ill work on that
