Dia 12. I started this session deleting the react-beautiful-dnd library from my project to install another one, react-dnd, but then I realized that the documentation was too hard to follow on that one, and my intuition was telling me that I should learn how to work with react-beautiful-dnd. SO I came abck to it, and todays session was all about understand how to implement it. The good part was that I found a functional list, as the one that Im implementing in this website, and I was able to go through the code and understand it, so that I could replicate in in a different way in my project with the elements of the kriya that is being created. I feel complete with what I did, it has been a good work. I close this session with a lot of work at hand which i would have liked to do, but a big part of what Im doing is respecting that there is a particular time to do the work, and if im not able to do it, Ill come back tomorrow. But it was a very productive session, beacuse breaking down the code so that I could tweak it and understand how to implement it is a very valuable skill that is good that I practice. Good good session.
