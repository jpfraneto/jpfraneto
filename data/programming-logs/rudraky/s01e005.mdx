Dia 10. Full on power today, creating the page on which new kriyas will be built. There is a section in the left where to add exercizes to the kriya, and a preview section at the right. Im going to implement a drag and drop feature in the preview list, so that it can be updated with a smooth and nice UX for when there is a mistake in the order of the exercizes. Im also adding a functionality that is realizing if there is any section of the class missing, and that will alert the user to add that section. I made some good progress today, and it felt good. It is amazing how different my learning has been since I decided to stop following blindly the course and started running on my own. This is the real deal, and Im happy with how it is going on.
