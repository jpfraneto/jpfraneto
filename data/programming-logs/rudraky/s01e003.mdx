Dia 8. I'm writing this on Sunday, because yesterday I was not able to come here to do the work that I said I would do every day. It fills me with weird sensations to not be able to give me the time to do it, it frustrates me, and it makes me feel that I'm not enough. As if I was not up to the circumstances. How can I build something bigger if I can't organize myself enough to do the daily work, and I fail on day 3?

But the thing is that there is a lot to learn about yesterday, of myself, of my relationship, of where I am at, of where am I going to. In the morning I proposed to my partner that we went to spend the day out, and we went to a town nearby called Frutillar and spent the day there. It was a great day. I had taken my computer so that I could go directly to the office when we came back, but it was too late and I had to come and make my baby sleep, and do stuff in the house. And then we ate something together and then we started having a romantic encounter, and it was too good to stop it. As I was going through, I was feeling in me the tension that was generated because of not being doing the programming work of the day, and it was incredible to witness it so clearly. And my command was to let go, to surrender, and to enjoy every piece of what was happening with her. And it felt incredible. It was one of the best sexual encounters that we have had in a long time, and for me, giving me the space of letting go, was important so that I could have in me the flexibility that I need to give my family what they need from me. There is times when I wont be available to do the work, for as much as I want it, and I need to make peace with that fact. I need to acknowledge it, reflect on it, and move on. Yesterday I was not able to do it because I prioritized my family, I prioritized the sadhana of KY that I'm doing this 40 days (kirtan kriya), and I prioritized observing myself and what was going on in my world yesterday. I was able to recognize that when I realized that it was late and I was not going to be able to do the work, I got anxious and my answer was to start eating shit that I don't eat often. And then I came here and started eating more, and smoked a joint, and then cared about my partner. It was a weird day really, with a lot of things that I'm not used to, and which shaked my ground a lot. The part that I need to observe more precisely is the food thing, because I don't eat refined sugars, or starch, or any of that shit, and there are times when I do it that I eat the whole thing. Why can't I bring balance into my way of eating? Why does it keep being an expression of my mental state in that moment? What needs to happen for me to move past from this focus on food and start enjoying really being able to recognize the consequences that these foods have in my body and not eat them more? Why did I decide to eat that piece of kuchen yesterday? What did the fact that I was not going to be able to do the work bring into my perception that my answer was to eat eat and eat?

All of these are important questions, since they are what drive my way of behaving. I feel a bit of shame for not doing the work yesterday, but today is a new day, and I will start with more power, trying to find the balance needed to share with all my surroundings as good as I can and also give me time for myself and for doing what I have to do so that I make the progress in this project that is my challenge right now. Time to move on. Everything is learning.
