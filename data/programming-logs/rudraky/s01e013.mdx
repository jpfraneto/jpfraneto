Dia 18. Today is a day on which I showed to myself my flexibility, because I wanted to go walking with my dog and it was raining outside so I decided to stay here and work from my house this session. This was very beneficial because I was able to go through the work in a way that makes me feel happy, it was a good session. There is a lot of things that I have to do today, so starting the day like this is important.

Regarding the programming, I went through some kind of basic stuff, kind of running in circles a little bit, but I'm sure that this will pay off as I encounter new problems which I will have to be able to build. The app is not yet ready for sharing it with my classmates to see what they think, hopefully I'll do that tomorrow.
