Dia 16. I started weird today because Im at my parents house and it is after lunch, but then I got into the flow and started doing things that needed to be done. Now the whole functionality for the kriya is working great, I feel like I could do a class tomorrow with this app working as it is. That makes me proud. What I really need to work on and make better is the way that the design looks, and that is something that has always been part of what I need to work on. I devote too much time to making it work properly in the functional part, but the design part is as important because if it is catchy people will tend to use it. There is a lot of work to be done in this aspect, and I think that as I create stuff with which people interact with, Ill get better at this part of the creation of apps. It is amazing how it is always a blank canvas, and this is what I face when I do this kind of work. The open void of endless posibilities. Thats where I learn!
