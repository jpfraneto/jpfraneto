The end is close, since tomorrow is the day on which I finish this project's layout. What will be important to do is to leave it up and running and afterwards update the github repo so that the information that is there will be informative on what the project is about. It needs to be a reminder to my future self and for other developers, since I will work on this anytime in the future. I feel that it is a useful concept, and the moment that I'm able to get it working in a good way it will be useful.

It has been hard for me to focus on the way of doing things, on develiping a proper workflow. I started writing what I would work on that session at the beginning of it, but today I forgot to do that and that speaks to me about my incapacity of being consistent in the way of doing things. I sometimes work in X hour, then in another one, and I need to get this better if I want to get really good at what I do. Part of making progress is coming to this realizations, and understanding that this is a continual process of improvement on which I need to reflect and evolve from that reflection.

The one that I do now is that it will be important for me to have a consistent workflow. I sit down, I do my thing, and then things start to happen. That's what I need to bring into myself as a new ritual. One of deep work. Of deep caring about what I'm doing.
