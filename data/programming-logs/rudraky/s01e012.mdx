Dia 17. I have been doing it all wrong! Git commits are for explaining what is new for that particular commit, not for explaining how I feel after that programming session. I will start to use this space for reflecting on the session, and the commit to explain what progress I made in that day.

I feel good with todays session, because I worked on something that is particularly aimed for bringing the app to my classmates so that we can all benefit from it. It will be an enhancer of my whole progress to have their feedback, and understand what I'm doing right or wrong with that, and how it can get better. The idea is for this app to be used by people, and they are the ones that will use it! It is great to open myself to sharing it. I fixed the issues that came up from vercel, and hopefully they are done and the app is up and running so that I can share it.
