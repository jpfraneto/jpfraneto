Dia 9. Yesterday I was not able to come here and do the work, because my familiar duties were more important than that. It felt really interesting to manage the tension that was generated in my experience because of not being able to code yesterday. It is part of the process, to find that balance and realize where and when, how to organize my time, so that I can do what I have to do. But this is a long shot, for a long time, so I will give my best to not be hard with me. There is a lot going on. But todays programming session was amazing, Im working with the api building, with the ability to create kriyas and save them to the db, read them from there, and play them with this information. The whole integration of the system is working as a charm right now, as I better understand how to use nextjs-es native functions such as getServerSideProps better to have a great UI. This was a really good day of work, I feel complete and motivated.
