Dia 11. Today was a day of trying to understand how to use the library React Beautiful DnD. Went through the documentation (whichs organization I was not able to understand) and then through the video tutorial and it was hard for me to implement it. Thats why I decided to build a basic list of elements so that I could get the grasp on how it works, so that afterwards I can shift this functionality into the kriya list component and organize the new kriya in a way that makes sense. I was not able to implement it, and what I could realize and understand about myself is that it is hard for me to go through the documentation and github issues in a way that is organized. I jump from one comment to the next one, not really understanding what I just read, and that conspires with my capacity of understanding what Im doing. If I took more time to read each comment and understand it properly, I would probably undeerstand better how React works, and that would be beneficial for my whole learning process. But it gets frutstrating to come up with code that I dont really understand, and this is a key thing that Im lacking right now, reading things that other people wrote and trying to find my way through that, given the current understanding that I have. This capacity for diving deep into the issue will be what determines my success in my craft, and i need to work on it so that I can build up the muscle. Today was a big learning, trying to get it. I will go thgouht the video tutorial and understand in a good way how to use this tool. That will teach me a lot about react, and how to learn. Good day.
