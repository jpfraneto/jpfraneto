Dia 13. Things are going good! I managed to make react-beautiful-dnd work properly, and the only issue that Im having right now is related to how it displays after there are too many elements in the page. I guess that there is a problem related to the ids being generated by Math.random(), which creates a UX that is not what Im hoping for. But tomorrow Ill work on that, and it should be good to go. After Im able to have a rich UX with this part of the app, Ill be able to create my own kriyas, and with that go through a class with this information. The time on which I create my first class will be the day of the full moon, and I will do it with this application working. It will be awesome. And for now, I just have to keep it going, this part is one of the most important ones of the app, because once it is up and running, Ill be able to hook it with the db in order to add new kriyas to it associated to particular persons, and with that have it for other people to use. One thing that Im lacking though is mobile first development, which has always been an issue for me. But I created the layouts with flex, so it shouldnt be hard to change things around from rows to columns so that it is optimized for mobile use. Im happy with how things are going, and motivated to have this project up and running so that it can help me do my classes.
