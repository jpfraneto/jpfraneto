Dia 6. I was struggling a big part of the session with how to access a particular exercize of the kriya so that I could update its completed property and I could not make it, so the way around it was to completely reimagine the kriya object and now it will be an array with the exercizes in a row, and each exercize will have in it the information related to which section of the class it is from. I have to organize again a big part of the functionality of the app because of this change, which doesnt make me happy, but it is part of what needs to be done so that i can progress. I feel good with it, and motivated to do it tomorrow. It was a good day, on which I recorded the first video of my screen while programming. It is day 0 of 108, and it feels good and motivating to have this goal
