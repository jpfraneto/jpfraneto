Spent a big time working with the APIs of the three services, to realize that the one that is best working is the youtube one (no wonder). The one of soundcloud does not have the possibility to add a new app to it since a while (for what I discovered researching it), and I still need to better understand how to work with the spotify one so that I can add the information for the music that has been added (it will be an album, so I'm thinking of Album Name - Artist [year of publication]).

Today I did not feel in my best mood for programming, it was challenging to go through that documentation and not being able to make the progress that I should have wanted. I realize that I'm lazy to read how to do things, I just want to get them done. And I was not able to get them done today, but tomorrow will be a new day on which I'll dive into each of the different apis and work with them separately. I'll create a page for each of them so that I can work around the different aspects of what I can do with them. Something like a sandbox for apis and services.
