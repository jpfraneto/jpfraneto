Holy shit, this has been one of the most powerful sessions I've had. I felt that I worked really good, in a state of action that was kind of closer than what I've ever encountered to 'flow' state. It felt great, and one of the biggest motivators of this was to have more focus on what I wanted to achieve. I realized that a very important part of the app that I'm building is the user page, since all the whole app is based on what people share. This helped me to realize how important it was to work on authentication, and I started the session thinking that I would trash the next-auth and start working just with auth0's nextjs integration. After a while I realized that this was not good, I decided to use next-auth because of the amount of contributors, starts and overall stats that it has in github. I had left it because I was not able to implement it, and this was something that had shown me a particular aspect of my programming journey till now, that had been that when I encountered a mountain I walked on the side of it, instead of grinding my brain till I understood how to climb it and persist to the other side with a new understanding of everything that I'm doing.

So working with next-auth was what I needed in order to do this, and right now the app has a running integration with the service, which makes me very happy and motivated. This was a great session.
