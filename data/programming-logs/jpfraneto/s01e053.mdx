Today I commited to the work on my personal website, which will be the project for this month in TOSF. First day, and I already have in place the reading of the programming logs that I have been writing for almost 2 months now. In those, I have been writing what comes up after each programming session, and trying to digest it by sharing a bit of what comes up.

Right now, for this project, I feel excited about what it will bring into my life. This last year has been of a fundamental shift in the way that I live, and this project comes perfectly at this moment as a way of making sense of all of what has happened. I feel very commited to it, to create something interesting, on which I'll be able to share stuff that is very important for me in a way that makes sense.
