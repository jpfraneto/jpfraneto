Today was one of those sessions on which I don't make progress in a way that makes me comfortable, because I spent a shitload of time running in circles. I was trying to fix the way that the api call was being made from the getServerSideProps function in the edit kriya component and I kept getting the same error over and over, which felt kind of frustrating. I built new routes to test the thing until I realized that the problem was that I had not added the /api part of the route in the fetch call... Bummer.

But shit happens, and this session is a reminder that sometimes the work will not be perfect, I will waste time, but that's why the long run is the important thing, and being consistent is a key part of it.
