Another good session, on which I realized that the layout and visualization of the app is very important, and I made progress to make it look great. I added a component on the left of the user's page, and it persists as I change between routes that are childs of /u/. This adds for a very neat UX, and it makes me happy to have been able to think about this functionality and then finding the way to build it. It looks great.

I also started working with the API's from youtube and soundcloud, so that I can integrate the user and with this fetch the information from each user so that her particular music can be played in the app. This is the idea that I have, hopefully I will be able to integrate the profiles from the person from both of this platforms. And if I'm not able to do it, I'll just bring in the option that they upload music to this app, and have different genres which can be played on different parts. It can be 'music for psychedelic therapy', 'music for meditation', etc, and people can add stuff to each of those sections. This sounds interesting, and I'm willing to give it a try.

Overall I felt great with the session. I woke up very late today but came here and worked full power for a long time, which gives me energy because I have been very motivated the last days!
