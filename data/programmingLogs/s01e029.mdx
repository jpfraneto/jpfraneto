Today I got up very early but was not able to come to work because I had to be in charge of helping my young Mila to sleep. But when I could come, I flew over the keyboard and worked smoothly into adding the functionality for the comment section of an individual sound, in its own page. This route is helping me to realize how to bring together different aspects of what I have learned, and I have been working very good the last days. With a lot of motivation, and the time flies when I come to code.

I still have those doubts related to the usefullness of the work that I'm doing in the overall structure of my path, but they always say that the best way to learn is by building stuff, and I have been doing it in a very good way this last days. That makes me comfortable.
