Much better day today. It was kind of hard to start the session because the internet in my office is horrible today, but I managed to enter the flow state and it felt good. I made some good progress, and the app is looking great, I feel very comfortable with it. I think it will serve its purpose, at least for me, as I go through the process of creating reviews of content that I consume and have them here organized. I'm missing:

- Ability to edit a sound review and delete it.
- Where is the sound added to? How can I view that later so that I can access that information and display it in a way that transfers information to the reader?
- Add a better description of the project. Why is curation important?
- Where are the last added media going to be shown?

I want to have it up and running on sunday so that I can use it and through that understand what is missing in it!
