This was a frustrating session, on which I ran in circles trying to find the answer to the problem that I have related to the app not working in production because of the next auth thing. This is a day on which I feel that I have not made any progress in the last months, and that I'm wasting my time in this because it is too fucking hard and I don't have the capacity for understanding where to put my energy into. It was a very frustrating session, because I did not do any progress. But going through this kind of sessions is what brings up something important inside, that is related to the capacity of being resilient. That is one of my main charactestistics, and this was a battle that was lost, but I'll keep working on it until I understand how to find my way through!

I'm building my carreer. I'm building my future. Patience is the key. Perseverance is the key.
