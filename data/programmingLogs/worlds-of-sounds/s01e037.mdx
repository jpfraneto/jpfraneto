Holy shit, today I'm sleepy. I woke up very early to listen to Death's album 'The sound of perseverance' because today I'll have the recording of the podcast episode for Timeless Integration with my brother, and that was the one that he chose. It is an important day, and as I was programming it was kind of hard to realize what to work on, but I ended up fixing evident bugs that I had in the app, that now are better.
