Coming back to work after a nice rest day yesterday. I did some scotch fixings that I know are not correct, but I had to make it work so that I could move on with what I have to do. It seems that this last days will be about making the layout look better, and through that understand what the app will be about.

I need to add the opportuinity of following a particular user so that you can see his/her last recommendations shared. That is a key aspect of this thing. Holy shit this is all very hard.
