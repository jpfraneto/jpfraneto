Dia 21.

This was a great session, because I worked a lot on understanding a core concept of react, which is the context api. I created a sandbox project so that I could play around with it and understand how it works, and to see if I can use it in this project in order to not have to fetch continually the data from the database. I made progress in this understanding, but there is still work to do. Tomorrow is a new day.
