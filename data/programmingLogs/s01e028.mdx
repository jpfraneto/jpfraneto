Holy shit, the last days I've been flying on the keyboard! Today was another great session, I started writing a birthday letter to my mother on which I acknowledged the amazing life that she gave me: life itself. I offered her the space for us to go to a therapist together, so that we can work in our relationship and with that become better participants of society. I feel good with the letter, and that was the starting point for this great session on which I worked on the rest routes that will enable the different sounds to be present in the app.

What I can see is that I'm working on rutinary things that don't add toooo much to my knowledge of react and next because they are the kind of things that I have to do to create the groundwork on which I'll build afterwards, but I feel really good for where i am at after only 6 days of working on this app. Something great that I noticed today or yesterday is that I'm thinking about this app even when I'm not programming, and that is something that didn't happen in the previous ones. That is a great sign that I care about this one. It feels good.
