This was the last session of this project, and I have to say that I didn't do anything of what I wanted to do, because I ran into a fucking bug which I was not able to work around. And it was a critical one, since it was related to not being able to drag and drop the elements of the UX when adding a new Kriya. This is one of the key features of the app, and it is sad to not have been able to do it properly, nor to style the last touches of the app. It was very weird because the app in production is working, and then I tried to fix it by deleting the whole code from my local development environment and then cloning it from the gh repo (which was working properly on production) but then I kept getting the same error. I don't know what the fuck happened, but it was frustrating to spend my last day of work in this project with this. But this is the interesting part of adding third party libraries, in this case react-beautiful-dnd, which added this drag and drop functionality but at the same time added the complexity that made me unable to work in the stuff that mattered in this last day.

As I read yesterday somewhere, it will be a very important skill to be able to determine if a particular tool is needed or not in the project, and how I'm going to be able to deal with the implementation of that tool in order for the whole system to be resilient. In this case, this project doesn't feel solid, it doesn't feel resilient, and that is because the implementation of what I have done has been using duck tape, trying to make it work by force instead of organically, and this is something that I need to work on in order to level up my game. I know that with practice I'll get there, but what if the practice that I've been doing is not the way to make the best progress that I could? This is something that is constantly in my mind, and that I need to work on in order to make the progress that I want to make. But I've put in the hours, and that is the important part, because the knowledge will stick in one way or another. As I made this mistakes of implementation, I'm learning about the consequences of them, and this reflection is a huge part of the learning process. It feels frustrating on one side, but on the other one it feels good, because I know that there is something valuable in here that if I'm able to get into my subconscious my programming skills will get to a new level. That is what this whole project is about... Evolution.
