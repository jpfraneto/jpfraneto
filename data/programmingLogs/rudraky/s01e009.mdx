Dia 14. Another great day. Work went smooth, I managed to understand that the problem that I had with react-beautiful-dnd was beacuse the different elements had the same id, and that created a really weird behaviour when I was dragging and dropping the elements. I used uuidv4 as the library to generate random ids and it went great. Then I was making the functionality for deleting elements for the kriya that is being previewed, and I also updated the list of missing sections of the class as elements are deleted, so that there is a correspondence between the missing list and the elements that are present in that moment in the kriya state. It worked great. Then I started building the api connection for adding this new kriya to the db, and one challenge that I have now is to homogenize the data structures because before I had another one, and this created a lot of bugs in the app because the UI was built for the data structure of before. But now Im working my way around it, and it is looking great. I feel motivated, and it was a good days work.
