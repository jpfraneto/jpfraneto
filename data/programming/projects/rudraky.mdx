This project was an exploration into the techniques of Kundalini Yoga and how they can better teached. KY is based on a different sets of exercizes called Kriya, and my goal in this project was to digitalize this kriyas so that a teacher can user them for guiding a class. There is an opportunity of having a timer in each part of the class, and the intention with that was to give the space for the teacher to rely on this system for giving the class. The interesting part of me building this system is that I created it without ever having been a teacher in a KY class, so the needs of the user where what I envisioned, but they were never based on experience.

Last week I had to teach my first class ever, and it was interesting because I did not use this app. I can't say why I didn't use it, probably it is because I'm old school and I like my papers to be all around as I do the class. I understand that mess, and probably this system is not as helpful as I envisioned it. It was more something like a challenge to build that something that brought true usefulness into my life. But it was fun to build, and it was part of the process. There is a part of recordings where the idea is the share classes of KY, and there is also a part of Kriyas that is intended for the teachers.

In this project you can see very much of my deficient design skills. It doesn't look very good, at least to me! But it was part of the learning process, it is there, and with that I'm complete.
