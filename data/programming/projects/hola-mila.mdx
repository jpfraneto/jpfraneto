It is funny to think about the popularity of the projects that I have built, and what is the relationship that that has with the complexity of the application itself. Hola Mila is very simple on its structure and architecture, but it has been the project that I have built that has had more traction. Why is that? Because there is a clear intention behind it, which is very clear to the end-users. The end-users themselves are very well identified: Friends and family that care about us, and that want to know better what is going on with our process of parenting. I created this one to be the home in the internet for us as parents, to share who we are, to share what we are. It started as a place on which to share the first 40 days of life of our little girl, and now it is beginning to evolve into something that will be her home in the internet. We have talked with my partner about the importance of having something like this, about the importance of having a place where we can write abour her, to her, to the people that care about us, and this website will be the place for that.

It is very simple on its design, but that simplicity has its magic. It is what brings people in, and lets them explore the different staged of it. I learnt a lot with it, because it showed me that it is very useful to not see a website as a static thing, as something that when it is published it is over. It shows me the importance and value of having it open for constant change, because I was building it every day, with every word that I wrote for uploading it into this place. I love the idea that she will have this place to come back as she wants it, and it brings joy into myself to have been able to create a home for our loved ones to come and see how she is doing. The next challenge is to upgrade this place so that we can update it more constantly, and that is what comes now.
