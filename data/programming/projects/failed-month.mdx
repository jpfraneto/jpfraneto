What is failure?

In my words, it is a misunderstanding of the purpose of something that happened in my life. It is a state of not acknowledging the process that comes from integrating the consequences of my actions, especially when they had a clear intention in mind. When there is a mis-alignment within the intention of something that I did and the consequences of the actions that I took in order to fulfill that intention and transform it into reality, there can be a sensation of failure in myself. That feeling of failure, or sensation, whatever it is, comes from a mindset of lack. Of not looking at the opportunities that what happened brought into my domain of action. If I see what happened as something inherently 'bad', I will probably judge and bring myself into a melancholic state, which is connected to not wanting to integrate what happened. When I'm in 'failure' state, I pretend to forget what happened in order to make progress.

But what if I move towards making the full process of integration so that I can better understand the role of everything that happened in the big picture of my life? I gave my energy to something, I put my being in it, and what if I do the process of acknowledging that and make it a building block of my future actions? Now that I write about this project, I tend to think that that was the role that it had in my process. Because of this one, because of me wanting to do something specific in it (build an app to track my daily habits), and because me not being consistent enough with that whole process, I realized that I needed some structure. That's when I decided to start with TOSF's last sprint, which is the frame that I build to work every day at least 88 minutes building the last projects of TOSF. Because of this 'failed' project, I was able to establish myself in a routine of consistent practice, of continuing to do the work, of showing up.

As I write this I am in my rest day, the day 94 of TOSF last sprint. I have been able to pursue this path steadily for the last months, and it feels fucking amazing. I have a recording of each session on which I have coded, and all these recordings are the consolidation of what started with this 'failed' project. If it haven't been because of the challenges that I had being consistent with what I was building in this one, I could not have realized that I needed this structure. Probably my work of the last 94 days would not have been as powerful as it has been.

So that is my understanding of failure right now. For failing, it is important to have goals. To set up them. To live by them. Have them there, as a measurement that you can use for having some kind of frame of reference. But don't let the achievement or not of this goals be the main producer of happines, of self worth in your life. I have not let this enter my life. Or better said, I have worked with effort to take it out of my life. Because my self worth comes from another place. It comes from doing the work that I say I will do. It comes from being consistent with my intentions. And it comes with the understanding that I can make mistakes, that things can happen differently from what I expected, and that is ok. It is part of the whole process. The mission is to get the most out of every on of the experiences, and getting myself to realize the value that each of them has for its own. That's where I'm walking towards, and this 'failed' project was a veeeery big stepping stone into that. Perharps it will be one of the most important projects of this whole journey!
