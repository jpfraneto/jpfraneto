I have been playing around with this concept of the digital second brain for quite a while, trying to build for myself a digital structure on which I can bring out of my mind, body and spirit and organize better my thoughts through mainly writing.

That is one thing, the other thing that my personal website was the project before the last one in TOSF, and I started creating it in a very important moment of my life. This last year has been very intense, engaging very deeply into the journey of my yoga practice, and through that erasing a little bit the images that I have for myself, so that I can set myself free into who I am in every moment. I want to feel the freedom that comes from not having to be someone particular. I want just to be. And this year has been a lot of that, and building my personal website was a means by which I connected to the consumation of this process. It was like going through a particular threshold, on which at the other side I would be someone different. The thing about that is that I kept thinking about that threshold to be very static. In my mind, it was a point in time on which I would be different at the other side. I made the parallell with the opening of the third eye, building up expectations on my practice of me having to be in a particular state of mind that would be radically different from before. So I came into the challenge of building my website with that in mind.

And what has come as an answer to that, and now I realize that that answer was built because of me doing the work every day, is how this website has been (and is) the unfolding of who I am. On this project, I established the foundations of the deeper exploration of who I am, and that exploration comes with the practice of doing the work every day. I come here almost every day to write something new, and that process of writing is what helps me to unfold my consciousness, and transform it every day, step by step, becoming the best that I can in that moment. And that best can be not good, and what I have learned is a deep appreciation of this whole process. Appreciate every aspect of who I am, in every moment, and embrace it with all of what I am. That has been so powerful for me, and now, as I come to this place and realize what I built here, I appreciate even more.

This website is in the background of my thoughts always, and it is so fucking great to have as a sandbox for exploring whatever ideas come into mind. It is another way of understanding what is valuable in the design process, because it is very simple. It's just a way of showing a buch of markdown files in a different way, and that is the power behind it. Markdown is an amazing format to write stuff, and I have this whole playground to explore its power. I'll have it always, and it feels good.
