When I think about what to write in this place, as a presentation of this project that I created for you, I come up to the realization that the best that I can do is share with you the intentions that I had as I was building it. This one, Drip Work, was one of the first projects that I created in the frame of The Open Source Factory. It is a foundational one, in the sense that its purpose was to build for myself a scaffolding that I could use in every session on which I came to my computer to do my work. I find it very important to be able to focus deeply, and then relax as much as I can, so that I can get the best out of my capacities. It is in this realm that I found out about Cal Newport's concept of Deep Work, and Drip Work is my interpretation of it.

It is the means by which I put myself on service to do the important work that I can do.

For that, I need to be focused. I need to put my whole being into the task at hand. I need something to hold me in that process, and that comes with structure. With the structure of knowing what are the missions for that session. With the structure of knowing for how much time I'll work. I need to be able to tell my surroundings which is going to be my necessity of time for that session, so that they can count on me aftewards. As my responsibilities grow, I have a bigger necessity for providing my best in every area of my life, and this project's intention is that. To give me the space to move in that direction. There is a profile on which all my deep work sessions are stored, there is a timer that starts every time that I want to start a new session, and there is the opportunity to add all these sessions into every project on which I'm working. It represents what I care about in my life, which is building structures that enable me to express my best.
