Time to write about the project that I have created that makes me feel the most proud. It is the starting point of all this journey, what got me into this, and what has me here putting all my heart to become as good as I can for building complex systems with which people can interact and the world can become a better place. Human Music is my answer to that. It is a place for gathering, for sharing, for offering to others the sounds that have captured part of your soul.

The whole process of building it was very important for me, I went through a lot of different phases, ones of them with a lot of noise in the UI, others with minimal noise. There was so much that I had to say through this project, and I fell into the trap of being too literal with all of that that I had to share. And good design is about leaving out what adds up as noise, and in that process letting the indispensable shine. Enabling the most important parts to be the ones that capture the attention of the user. And in this case, in the product that has been up and running permanently for more than one year, what that is is the music itself. This has been a permanent radio that has been playing for a long time now, on which people from all over the world have shared the music that they love, and with that build it more and more into something that captures the essence of what music is for the human being.

As I write that I feel that I'm overstating my capacities. How can I create something that can distill this essence? In no way I can, but this is my way of thinking about it. It is my way. The randomness of it. The opennes of it. The fact that there is no boundaries on what can be shared, and the fact that it is a constant loop of videos, one after the other, adding up into an eternal thread. This is the essence of life captured in this eternal thread of music. As I was building it, I had a lot in my awareness the memory of my grandmother, who spent the last 7 years of her life in a bed, without any way of communicating with the outside world. I would have loved for her to have this thread of music to enjoy those years, to be a companion to whatever she was going through. That was part of the intention that I had behind this project, and it is very important for me to come back to it and understand better all what I did in here. It was a lot about divergence after convergence, it was a very long creative process, but which was sustained in the commitment to do the work. To sit down and try to make my way through the whole universe of information that there is for programming. This was the spear that I used to make my way through all those bushed that polluted the initial layers of the process, and it was the perfect one, because it kept me motivated and commited.

And the end result is great. I use it almost every day in my house, my partner loves it, and there is a small group of people that I have shared it with and have found value on what is here. There is still not too much traction, but I really don't care about it. One day it will happen, and that day there will be many more interesting things going on in there. For now, it is a place where I come every day to find joy, to motivate myself, and to remind me about the boundless capacity that my imagination has. That also helps me want to become a better programmer, so that I can make the process of building these realities more efficient, more straightforward, and with that be able to create cooler stuff. I continue to evolve, day by day, and this project was what put me in this path.

I came back here to write a little bit more about this place. I was writing this same description for my personal website and I wanted to play some music so I went into spotify and spent 3 minutes deciding which is the music that I was going to play in this moment so that I could focus better on the task at hand. I ended up not finding anything, and just came to human music and played what is in there. I did not have to make the thought process of finding some music to play, because the music is already there. That is the huge power of this thing, because it enables me to stop using that brain and decision power and leave it for the important stuff. I'm not saying that deciding which music to play is not important, it is the most important thing, and that's why it is so hard for me. There could always be 'something more' that I could be playing, and eliminating that brings a lot of freedom to my actions. It is awesome. This place that I built is awesome.
