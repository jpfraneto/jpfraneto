What I had in my heart as I was building this project was how amazing the process of giving birth is. It is called mamiferas, because that is the way that in spanish we speak about mammals. With my partner in this whole being parents thing we dove very deep into the mammal aspect of women, specially when they are in the process of nurturing the small little and amazing life that is inside her. This whole process just takes the breath out of me and fills me with amazement, especially now that I listen to my little daughter Mila cry and I realize how intelligent life is. How impossible it is that we are experiencing this adventure, but here we are, listening through the internet to the Lex Fridman podcast, to Aubrey Marcus, to Andrew Huberman. To all this great people that exist now and have ever existed which want the evolution of our species explicitly. There is so much beauty in this world, and this project was a celebration of that.

I'm coming back to the website after a long time, and it is very interesting to see the design decisions that I took and that make it what it is. I feel happy about it. I think that I did a very good job. It works, it has a very straightforward look. I logged into my profile and it says that I have -211 days until my baby is born. That's how much time it has gone by since I logged in, because my baby is now almost 7 months old, and I was creating this project a few months before she was born.

One of the most great things about the whole process of this project was opening myself to share it, and what came from there. I sent it to a group of people with which we were part of a process of learning more about labor, about the birth, and as I shared it I felt very anxious. I don't feel comfortable sharing my work with the world, and when I did it I had to go through the sensations that came to my body after that. It was very interesting. I remember those moments and feel excited about all the rest of those moments that the future will bring. There is so much that can happen if I open myself to share my work. I created it with all my love, celebrating all the mothers that have came before, and all the ones that will come, and that is the only thing that matters in the moment of sharing. Whoever doesn't resonate with it, it is not my problem. My problem is just to build it as good as I can so that it can be valuable for someone.

Another thing that I learnt building this project is about the importance of feedback. Probably if I had done the process with people that would be the potential users of the app, the design would be more focused on them and their needs. But I did not have the opportunity to do this, and it is ok. A big part of this first season of TOSF is me trying to go through the design process on my own, without guidelines, without a map, showing up every day and doing what feels good in that moment. It is part of the experience, and after having done it for this time I can recognize how better it is to be working with the people that will use it!
