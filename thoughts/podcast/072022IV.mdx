Using this album as the screwdriver that got us bringing out of ourselves the pain that the educational system creates into persons that don't fit in it. We also delve into how a static piece of media (as this album) can be experienced differently in moments of our life where we are more or less in sync with the environment with which we are surrounded. How creativity can be what is at the other side of war, and how connecting to ourselves is the means by which we can process both personal and collective pain.

This conversation was with my brother, the person that knows me more, with which I have shared the depth of life at its fullest. I hope that there is some value in it for you.
