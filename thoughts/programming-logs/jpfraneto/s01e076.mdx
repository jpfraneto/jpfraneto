I drank too much coffee at my mothers house and it is killing me. Anyway, the thing is working very good. I'm getting to a simplicity in the webpage that makes me feel good, and the workflow that I will use to add the information that I will share is also good. I feel good about it. I have a few days left till I finish this project, and I will give it my best so that it can be very helpful for what I need it.
