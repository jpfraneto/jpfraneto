Another hard day in the house, fights are getting bigger, and that makes it harder for me to come and focus in the work that I have to do. I came to work after lunch, with things in a better spot, but with a lot inside me because there is frustration, anger and stuff that needs to come out. I'm in a process of understanding what is this all about.

Related to the programming, I'm not clear yet where this is going, and what I'm doing. It is a continual process of iteration, on which I do whatever I imagine in that moment. Yesterday in my therapy I had a vision that these sessions need to be early in the morning after my yoga practice, and I need to embrace that and start making it as part of my morning routine, at least this last 41 days of this last sprint. I need to be consistent so that I can feel good, so that my workflow is conducent to something of quality,
It means a lot to me to be building my own webpage, and I need to be truthful about how I want to share myself with the world. There is a lot of work to be done. Step by step.
