Today was a shorter session that I intended, because I had a very important conversation with my brother about what we are going to build together. It is time for us to get our shit together, and start bringing into the 3D what had been modelled in our minds for a long time. This brings motivation to me, because I really want to be able to create something that is a translation of who I am into the world. I want to change the world through this. And my brother is the perfect companion for that.

The session of today was about organizing the page, not knowing where I'm heading to. It is time to find my voice, and right now I don't know how to do that. It has been an interesting process. Things are working how they should, and the different routes are an expression of that. It looks good.
