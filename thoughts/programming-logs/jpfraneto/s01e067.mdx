A new sunday mission accomplished, with quite a big mess going on in the website. But I'm beginning to understand better what this is about, and what I will share here. It is about starting to realize that this is going to be in production (it already is), and it is important to have the space so that I can feel comfortable with what I'm showing to the world. It feels good. Tomorrow will be a new day. It has been a nice weekend, and tomorrow I start a new sadhana because I start the new project with the bootcamp. It will be a new sadhana, for 20 weeks, with a nice community around it.
