Another great session after having breakfast with the friends that I have near my house. Simple people, but very heart filling. I had a great morning also with my morning sadhana listening to some amazing music. The functionalities of the app that I wanted to bring are working well, and now I need to add the possibility to add custom fields when I'm creating a new entry in the sadhana. This will bring a lot of freedom into the app, and it will be great for adding new information as I do the work every day. Tomorrow comes rest day, and I'm happy of that. On monday I start the new bootcamp, and I'm excited for what I will learn there and where it will lead me to. Good good week, finding balance, evolving.
