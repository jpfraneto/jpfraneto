This is when I'm closing this project... Tomorrow is the last day. How I feel? Of course weird. I don't know if this project is going to help me get anywhere in my carreer. Is this a good face to show to the world? This is what came up as I came to do the work. Nothing to do, it is what it is... It is who I am. I need to make peace with that, hold it in my heart, and move forward using this space as a container for what I believe. I want to keep doing the work, I want to keep learning. I want to keep exploring.
