I managed to work out the flow of adding the logs into the website by reading the mdx's. I worked in the afternoon today, and it has been interesting since I have had another energy. It feels good to have this flexibility and bring it into my workflow. I was not able to code thaaaat much, but it ended up being productive since I also started working with the Loom API so that I can record videos and share them in the website. I don't think this is a functionality I'll add in production because it seems that the SDK doesn't work thaat well, but it is insteresting to dive into it and see what comes up.

I feel good, it was a nice session.

Tomorrow, I'll hook the DB so that I can start adding the album of the day and displaying it.
