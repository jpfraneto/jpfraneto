The approach that I took today for understanding better how to deal with the api of the system that I'm using to read my markdown files has not helped me to realize how to do it in a good way. Something interesting is that I have realized that maybe the approach that I took is not the best, since I named the files in a way that is different from the information that is inside them, and that is not helpful for searching for them as I use the content layer.

I also was not able to read the documentation in a way that could help me to realize what I need to do in order to make it work. I went through it skimming, and tried to understand how the thing works by tweaking values here and there. A better approach for the next time would be to read the documentation and with that learn how the thing works, so that aftewards I implement it with a better understanding. I will do this tomorrow, since this whole markdown reading thing is a key component of my website, on which I plan to write a lot.
