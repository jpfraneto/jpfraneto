Great session. I was able to create the edit page, which is nice, and I felt great as I was programming. The music was awesome too.

The part that is not that great is that I keep pushing forward the resolution of the big doubt that I have related to fetching the information for the webpage. It needs to be faster, and not be fetched every time, but I don't know how to do that yet. But overall, this was a good session and I'm not giving myself enough time to write this because I have a meeting soon with a friend from college that I have not seen for quite a while now.
