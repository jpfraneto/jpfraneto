Getting ready to rumble. I have three days left for working in this app, and today was a day of doing some gardening in the code so that it can be up and running in production. I hope that I'm able to have it ready for tomorrow so that I can share it with a few people and with that realize which are the small tweaks that I can do to it so that it can be functional in the close future.

I feel good with today's session. I gave myself the permission to sleep a bit more today, to eat breakfast before the session, and it felt good. There is no a particular aspect of what I did today that I can recognize as an important matter on which those elements impacted my coding capacity. My journey in every coding session is so dependent on subtle aspects of my being that day, and it is important for me to realize that all these habits that I have brought into my life are not the main thing which is going to help me or not. What helps is to have a clear mind, and be certain of what I'm doing. That is the mission, and through this open source factory journey I have been able to recognize those elements in what I create.
