description: The ONE THING That Defines Truly Successful People | Alex Banayan | Aubrey Marcus Podcast
---

Aubrey: What is the long term relationship that you see in your future related to your tendency to be extreme in the things that you expose yourself to, instead of doing them more in a persistent basis, drip by drip?

Alex: What would your conversation with Jessica Alba would have looked like if you started sharing with vulnerability the position you were in that moment related to your father's situation? Do you think it would have ended on a similar place?

- The shabbath is a practice that has been used for a long time and it speaks about leaving one day per week for full rest. This is part of the work. It is not something separated from the work, it is an integral part of it.
- Alex also spoke about a thirty day challenge that he has created for creating a compass needle in one's life, and it consists of leaving 15 minutes per day, during 29 days, reflecting on the following three questions: What filled me with enthusiasm today? What drained me energy today? What did I learn about myself today? On day 30, you go into a place that feels festive, sit down for one hour, and go through all this journalling, reflecting on it as it was written by another person, and you write three headlines related to each of this questions. This gives a lot of information about oneself, where I'm at and which is a good place to move towards to.
- On the story with Jessica Alba there is a lot of expectations that were far from reached beacuse of the vulnerability that was shared in the conversation between Alex and her. This made the door wide open for connection between them.
- The third door is the one that you find when you look for it, and you are willing to put in the work. There is no possibility that magic will make you accomplish your goals, there needs to be work put in it for things to work out.

After listening and feeling this episode I felt inspired to give myself a break once in a week. It is very important for me to find balance in my life, and this last year it has been hard since I have thought that is very important to not leave any day without programming, because I need to make progress. But a big part of this progress is related to me being in a good place with myself, with my family, and I think that this day of Shabbath can bring that into my life, because it will increase the connection between our family, and it will give us a cathedral in time -as alex puts it-, where we will be able to retreat and feel something that I don't know yet what it is because I haven't experienced it.

Another thing that comes to mind strong is related to the way that Alex shared his story about his interview with Jessica Alba, which was framed by Aubrey in a great way before. The way of telling the story was very interesting, and I sat down to listen to it with joy. It felt great, and I felt connection. The way that he spoke about his family passing out around the time that his book came out was very inspiring, since now I'm doing the work of accepting my parents as they are, and it has been fucking hard. But what he said, and what he shared Jessica saying to him motivate me to leave the shit and weird feelings behind and just appreciate my parents for who the have been in my life, the most important persons. Without them I wouldn't be here, and I have to acknowledge that and have it in my mind every time that I interact with them. They'll not be here forever.
