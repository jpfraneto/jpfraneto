Aubrey: Given the sexual trauma that you spoke about and how it impacted the way that you approached your sexual life a big part of your life, which is the advice that you would give me so that I could be the supporter that my little girl needs as she grows up? How would giving her this advice would transform her experience growing up, and my experience as a father?

Molly: Which is the starting point so that I could start having a healthy sexual relationship with my partner? Why don’t you create an interactive online course/workshop where we could explore together in community the journey towards a fulfilling sexual life?

- Molly talked about ‘kypassana’ (?) which is vipassana for the modern days. This hits a key in my way of perfecting my practice and why I’ll teach, since a big challenge for it will be how it resonates with people so that I can spread the word in a way that sticks.
- No one is on her dying bed regretting what she did with bravery.
- Sexual trauma is deep in the way that modern individuals engage in their life, and healing from there can bring an important aspect of resolution, which enables a better life, better relationships and a better society.
- The importance of integration in psychedelic experiences. There is people that go to ketamine therapy and end up being addicted to ketamine, because there is not a proper process of integration going on. It is very important to talk about the dark side of psychedelics, in order to be able to use them in benefit for the most.

After listening to this episode I feel motivated to build what I have been envisioning. The way that Molly talked about her spiritual awakening and way of pursuing what she believes is correct and will change the world, is highly encouraging and it gives me a strong dose of willingness to trust myself.

Another important thing that stays inside is the importance of working on my sexual trauma, and use this as a way of improving the relationship that I have with my partner, and with that, my whole life. It all starts from home, and if I’m able to bring into it love, it will spread from there. I can recognize that until this point I have been waiting for my partner to show me some lights that there is some willingness to work on this together, but this episode showed me that it is important that it starts from me, so that I can bring her on board. It will be very important for me to realize that there is wounds that need to be healed so that I can take out the pressure that I have related to this topic, and she is the most important person in my life to do this work. Both of us will benefit from this, and our little Mila also. She deserves two parents that have a healthy sexual life, so that we can teach her with the example on how to grow knowing her body, knowing her limits, and knowing that sex is much much more than what appears in the movies, or in porn. I am one of the consequences of masturbating watching porn, of having a sexual life which was most of the time drunk, and without caring who I was with. It’s time to fix that.
