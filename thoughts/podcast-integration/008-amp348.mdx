Aubrey: How do the people that were around you in the moments were you were working in investment banking resonate with what you do now, and how is your relationship with those connections? How to reach those people with the message?

Shawn: How can alcohol be seen as a medicine? How could a big chunk of life of alcohol abuse add meaning to a later part on which there is a recognition of the harm that that abuse created in myself?

Key Takeaways:

- There is no bottom for how deep you can go.
- There are different traditions and they have different ways of working with the plants that are brewed into Ayahuasca (Peruvian) and Yah√© (Colombian). The ceremonies and way of structuring the sessions are different also.
- A consequence of the work is building up the strenght that is needed to endure stuff that can happen in life, and to be able to deal with it with more clarity.
- What are you going to do with the information that you got? How are you going to activate it in a day to day basis so that it truly transforms the way that you exist? This is the real shit.

Self Reflection and Mirroring of what I just heard:

As my upbringing has given me more than what I need to be in a place of absolute comfort, I have found the necessity to look for ways to find this discomfort in other realms. This is where I resonate with what they spoke about at the end of the podcast, because this work is about confronting the darkest parts of myself, and through that realize that there is always a part of me that can be worked on, and this is what the medicine is about. It is a means by which I'm able to recognize those spots. Next comes the strength that is needed to face those decisions and be able to deal with them in a way that feels like an evolution, that feels like I'm helping the world move forward. I have found that this is something that challenges me a lot, and it is truly where the real integration happens, because it is way much easier to think about some good stuff that I could do, that I could bring into my life, but the important part is actually going through bringing that into something concrete.

Another feeling that I got as I was listening was one of having kind of 'wasted' the first part of my life because I didn't engage in enough wild stuff. It is easy for me to feel this way as I listen to people which's life has been way more interesting than mine, and it is important to reconcile this thought and have in mind what Aubrey said, that a good life is a present tense game. It is built with the decisions that I'm able to take on every moment, and how I decide to interact with all my reality. That is what I can continue to evolve step by step, and through that realize that the path that I have walked now is perfect because I took the best decisions that I could in those moments given the state of mind that I had. I did have a lot of fun though, not the way that they were talking in the podcast, but I cannot say that I was buried below a rock all that time. A big question that I create for myself now is: How can I consciously use the experience of all my life as the fuel that can empower the process of building strength that I'm at? How does this strength derive from those experiences? How could I benefit all the people that 'once knew me' and get to them with this new knowledge, and resonate with them in any way? Is that even possible? Is it worth it?
