Brett: What lessons from base jumping have you brought into your professional life?

Joe: What is a good way of managing the tension that is generated in me when there is someone that is not willing to give up their position?

- Impartiality is about leaving my agenda by the side and realizing that I don't really control de outcome of what is going to happen. It is better to listen to what the other person has to say, and grow the relationship/conversation from there. The outcome of that is more profound, because it bears in mind the conjunction of the different points of view.
- There is a close relationship between being partial and fear. My interpretation of this is that when I'm being partial I'm trying to establish myself in a position where I don't have the fear of loosing my individuality or my needs in the way things are going to turn out.
- There is a visceral/bodily reaction that comes from being impartial, and that is what I need to listen in order to be able to communicate in this way. If it comes from the mind, it'll be fake, and it will end up showing up in the conversation. That is why VIEW is a state of being more than a particular skill, because the body sends the signal before the mind speaks.

I'm preparing for my third VIEW meeting, and listening to this has been important because it has shown me better what this important concept of impartiality is. From the 4 VIEW concepts (Vulnerability, Impartiality, Empathy and Wonder), this is the one that calls my attention the most, because it speaks directly to the part of myself that I'm developing through my practice of Yoga. I want to learn how to connect, how to listen more to what others want and need, and what was spoken in this episode resonates a lot with that. Leaving my agenda on the side opens up the possibility for the other people to shine, and I don't have to spend my valuable energy on trying to change them. There is no right or wrong, there just IS. And that is what this concept speaks about, and that is the important part of it. I feel inspired by the conversation, and ready to jump into the meeting now so that I can practice this.

I'm trying hard to think more about what it brought to me, but I can **feel** that there is a lot of it inside me, that will start coming up in the conversation that I will have with Sharon in a few minutes. I really want to teach my body how to be in this state of being, so that I can embody this concepts in each of my interactions and bring my best version (and that of others) into the conversations.

There is no right, there is no wrong. There just is.
