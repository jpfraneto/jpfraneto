Charles: You asked Daniel about chemicals or elements that have been supportive or his journey of living a more responsible life. What is the answer for this question in your own experience?

Daniel: Have you experienced a moment in your life where you can recognize that your third eye opened? How did that transform the way that you existed?

- In times of scarcity what is needed is generosity.
- Daniel says that we all have a guardian angel, and we can tune in with that being to receive guidance if the calling comes from a place of truth.
- When practicing healing of other people Daniel spoke about taking himself out of the way and just letting his intuition do the work, helping him to be a mirror for the other person’s experience, not judging and just being.
- All traditions and wisdom point to the elimination of force as a means of making true progress in alignment with intuition. Surrendering is something that needs to be trained in this day and age.
- Clean the body, detoxify it to prepare for the future.
- I recall the story of a patient of Daniel who had been abused by her father and he asked her to travel to the infancy of him, and see how he was abused… How does that change the perspective? What comes from realizing that he is just a consequence of the circumstances that brought him up?

After listening to this episode I am more aware of the endlessness of the path. Daniel has gone through a huge amount of experiences and stuff that has taught him how to deal with the world, and in any case he is close to a resolution. What I am experiencing right now as an awakening and opening of my intuition is just the starting point, one that needs me to break the boundaries of my ego so that I can start sharing my trust to the world in spirit of openness, vulnerability and selflessness. That is where the actual truth comes from, and the fact that I feel so connected to the shiva granti, the knot of the third eye, which is related to the spiritual ego is a signal for what I need to see.

How I train this acceptance, and how to untie this knot? In my own environment, in my own family. Opening to the truth of those who surround me, and stop trying to fix them with what I have found that is helpful, but just being who I need to be. Asking more than talking. Listening. Asking How/What questions. ‘Cómo ha estado tu día? Qué te motiva de hoy?’ Really caring about what they have to say, so that I can leave myself on the side and surrender to the humbleness that comes from that space. That is where my consciousness will arise in full power, and that is what I have to bring into my experience. This episode taught me about service, and about what is needed to be truly in service, which is knowledge, experience and surrendering. Surrender to not be the guide, but giving people the tools to be their own guides. That is how it works. People need to be their own guides, for that is how they will be able to heal their deepest wounds.
