title: Te Power Of Play - Huberman Lab #058
date: 012022II
description: In this episode, I discuss the transformative nature of play—how it changes our feelings, thoughts and actions and indeed, how it can rewire our brain to function better in all contexts. I explain the role of play in childhood, as well as adulthood in skill and social development and describe key characteristics of the mind and body during play. Additionally, I explore how play allows the brain to test contingencies in different roles/environments. Throughout, I discuss the underlying neurobiology of play. I also describe how low-stakes play, and tinkering can broaden and shape your future capabilities. Finally, I discuss how our childhood ‘personal play identity’ informs our adult personality. Throughout the episode, I use the science of play to outline recommendations for using play as a means to enhance neuroplasticity and explore novel situations, regardless of age.

Andrew: How does the suppression of play affect the development of a young child, and how does that translate into the future adult? I'm wondering after a conversation that I had with a friend that said that when she was a young girl she had a rambunctious attitude and she usually was 'shut down' by her significant adults because it was not a proper behaviour. Which neural pathways are shut down by this and what could be a good way to restore some sanity?

- There is a lifelong impact that play has in our ability to enhance connection between neurons (and with this impact in the way we behave as humans) that is very connected to how we interacted with the act of playing as a child. As we are young, our brain is a huge map of neurons that are very interconnected with each other, and as we grow, part of these pathways are 'selected' (based on our whole life circumstances). Andrew talks enfatically of play as a state of mind on which you engage with a particular activity with an intention of exploring what is possible. Of expanding the boundaries. This frame of mind is key for success in almost every realm of life, since there will probably always be benefit from viewing the situation that we are in with different eyes.
- Play is a means by which we explore boundaries, from early childhood and throughout all our lifes.
- There is big evidence of animals having playful ways, and there are physical cues that talk about this. In humans, two of these cues are related to the eyes being in a particular way that I don't remember (I think it was more open than closed) and the tongue out. This is how we communicate to each other instinctively that we are in this playful state.
- The 'takeaway recommendation' is to play at least one hour per week, in something that I don't have proficiency in, and without engaging too intensely in the outcome of what is happening. Play just for the sake of it, and if I'm good at chess, let's go and play some Monopoly without getting greedy.

Throughout the episode I remembered a lot a meeting that I had with a coach of an online course that I was being part last summer, on which I was playing my more serious role because I really cared about it and she looked at me and said: So when are you going to play? And that hit me hard, because I realized that on trying too hard, on wanting to get the most out of the experience (of life overall I might say) I was forgetting the joy that comes from just going back to being a young child full of wonder and just experiencing life without the lens of what will happen if this comes up not as expected (which now I can translate into this attitude of not being attached to the consequences of the activity with which I'm engaging in, say it could be programming, listening to a podcast, woodworking, etc.).

I think about the pandemic, and impact it has had in the way on which I interact with other people. How is play affected by not being able to be in the same place with other people, to smell them, to see their physical cues and realize how much of a playful attitude to they bring? This are things that come to mind as I wrap up what listening to this episode brought into my awareness, and realize that it will be important to have in mind the importance of play as it translates into every sphere of my life. I love the idea about play not being just about being fun, but of having a mindset that is focused on expanding the limits of what is possible. As I go through trying to discover new ways of being valuable in my life, this is something very important to have in mind.

How can play teach me about who I am, as I go through the ways on which I engage with the game? I'm wondering about all this metaverse thing that is going on, and how they want to build a digital environment. What if we were able to really gamify life, and make it all a big game? It is already something like that isn't it? I have just forgot it as those neural pathways got erased and I got more and more into the character that I have built for myself. Thank you Andrew for what you do.
