Lex: How much of a duck tape are deep work sessions?

Tim: How do you curate the information that you consume?

This was a conversation that I had fun listening to. I enjoyed it. There is not too much that I can organize myself to write right now, there are not many ideas that come to mind as a reflection. My brain is tired, it is late, I ate too much sugar, and I can't think clearly. But I'm motivated to do the work, and this is a celebration day, because tomorrow is the day on which I launch a new project of the open source factory. They spoke about procastination, and that is something that I can see myself going through. THe thing is that this last year I have been able to wake up early, show up when I intend to, etc, but it has been something that has been evolving through time. I started with 4 fixed hours of programming, and it was too stressing for me to manage it, so I had to reduce them to the 1.5 mandatory hour that I do every non-satur-day. This is my commitment, and the expression of me being the opposite of procastinator. But it is interesting because there are aspects on which I procastinate, and I tell myself the stories that bring me into this.

It was interesting to listen about the information silos, what happens when there is people that can't talk because their opinion is too different from the one established. This produces a lot of stress in the system, and it is what is going on in universities where there is no opportunity for free speech because people are talking things in away that doesn't provide this space. With free speech there also needs to be a cultural aspect of if that enables the possibility for there to be truly free spech. That is something that is not working well today but hopefully it will get better.

How would a world look like when there was an artificial intelligence that would tell me everything that I need to do for my body? How would wielding that power look like? Which decisions I would make? This are interesting questions because it will show me where my priorities are, and how in a perfect world this things are connected. What would I want in that perfect world? How would that future me look like?
