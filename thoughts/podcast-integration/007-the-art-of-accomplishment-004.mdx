Joe: How can I avoid getting tired of trying to practice empathy with people that are not willing to do it themselves?

Brett: How are the ways on which you activelly practiced empathy in this conversation? How did it came up?

- There is a phisiological component to empathy that gets expressed in the way my body feels when I'm with someone,
- Empathy is about being with the other person, and what is happening to them.
- A good way of practicing empathy is to recognize the body language or reaction of the other person and ask a question from there... I noticed that you backed off a little bit, how is this conversation making you feel? That creates connection.
- There are tricks and tactics that people have developed for making the mind think that empathy is being practiced (say the name of the other person, etc), but it will end up exploding in the face of the person because empathy is what is required to establish a true deep connection.

Listening to this episode this morning I had a deeper understanding of what developing intuition is about. Finally it is all related to how a particular circumstance makes me feel, in my whole being. The definition of intuition that I have present now is that of being in complete attunement with the bodily reactions that something that happens produces in me. As I'm able to tap into those sensations, stare them at the eyes, and understand how they impact my whole reality, my capacity of reacting to those circumstances in a way that is resonant with what I truly am is what determines the world which I will build around me. If I'm more attuned to these sensations and what they bring to me, I'll build a world that is connected to that. This was completely eye opening for me.

I want to be able to bring more empathy into the way I interact with people, but it is quite a big challenge for me. I realized today that I have a big issue relating to feeling and understanding my emotions, I don't feel like I do it at all, and I think that I have been all this time trying my best to learn how to do it, but there doesn't seem to be any big progress. I consume al this content that teaches me how to better deal with my circumstances and then I come home and have a huge argument with my partner and everything dissolves into the nothingness. At least that is what seems that is happening, but then I can see a little bit deeper and realize that these arguments are the removal of shit that needs to come out in order for true, deep change to happen.
