[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a tools that is very helpful for building static HTML websites. It labels itself as the modern way of building html websites.

For starting to work with this tool, go to a new folder and run in the terminal the command `npm init astro`, then follow the instructions and choose a starting template.

After this I run `npm install` to bring in the folder all the packages that are associated with this tool and npm installed 454 packages. The thing about this is that all these packages are in the development part of the process, since Astro only ships HTML to the end user. It takes care of all this in the background.
